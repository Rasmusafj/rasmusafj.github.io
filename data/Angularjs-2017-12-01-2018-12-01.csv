tuhoojabotti,"I think you are right, although it's hard to read because of the fonrnatting issues. That piece of code seems pretty confusing overall.

Following modern practices; $scope shouldn't be used since it can be confusing sometimes (instead bind the scope to the controller class and used [component model](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component)). That will make it way easier to migrate to Angular 2+ later on. 

RootScope and event passing makes it easy to pass information through the application, however it can easily lead to different parts of the application become dependent on other parts in a complicated spaghetti manner. Instead data should flow top-down via bindings and only up via events. One way to simplify this is to use a common data store model (see Redux for example).

one of the advantages of serverless is its autoscaling, and as such, you should break down your apps into the smallest functional blocks as needed:

in this case each endpoint should be getting its own function. so that should endpoints need to scale, they will scale independently from one another.

jrvkxzcf,"When you import your service into an NgModule file and register it as a provider, what you're doing is hooking your service into Angular's dependency injection system.  Notice that what you're actually doing is putting your service's constructor into the providers array.  Angular can then take that constructor and use it to create an instance of your service for you.  When Angular does that, it will also take care of injecting any other services into your service's constructor, and it will allow you to in turn inject your service in other places.  The whole point of the NgModule configuration is to register your service with Angular's dependency injection system.

When you import your service into your component file, you aren't actually using the class/constructor itself.  Instead, you're just using the imported symbol as a type annotation on one of your component's constructor parameters.  Angular's dependency injection system can use the type annotations on the parameters in your component's constructor to determine which services need to be injected.  So when you import a service into your component's file, you're really just importing it as a means of identifying your service to Angular's dependency injection system so that Angular knows what to inject.",1541445221.0

Not only do you yourself need keep track of how everything should be exported and imported, if any of your other team members do it wrong, things can get messy down the road and you end up spending days debugging module import/exports.

So you have to keep track of where a component should be declared (or provided if it's a provider/service) then export the component in the components file, import it in the modules file and add it to the exports file there, then import that module in another module AND then import the component/provider in that modules components files.

Sometimes you also have to add it as an entryComponent also.

So that is about 6 import/exports in total you need to do to use Component A in Component B and that is assuming the components is in the same npm project.

To me the Ember experience feels more complete. It seems more opinionated and if you follow those conventions a lot of stuff goes automatic. Angular requires more manual work.
But Angular feels more lightweight as in: not that complete.
I like Ember Data because I am an old backend developer and I know MVC well. But I have some stuff with RxJS observables that I really like too.

congowarrior,"Are you comparing apples to apples? I would make sure your project is not a dot net core project vs a dot net standard project. 

&#x200B;

That is the first thing. After that, there are many different types of dot net applications. From WebAPI projects, Web Apps, MVC, etc. They look the same fundamentally but might not have the same contents or file layout. The default WebAPI application (without the frills) comes with no ""Views"" folder meaning you don't get any \_Layout file. That does not mean that you cant eventually turn your WebAPI project to function like a MVC project. 

&#x200B;

All the previously mentioned differences are before considering the differences between angular projects. There are more than a dozen possible combinations for the file structure between your application/applications. 

Personally, my experience with SPA applications has involved the SPA and the dot net WebAPI backend having no clue about each other. The Angular SPA simply shoots out REST requests to the WebAPI. The SPA code is in a different git repo from the WebAPI. The SPA is served on a different process/server from the backend. Point being, this too is a valid architecture for your application.

Asmor,"I don't know anything about providers, so everything I'm about to say is strictly for factory vs. service.


All services can be implemented as factories. Not all factories can be implemented as services. Both factories and services are singletons (they'll be executed a single time the first time called and then always return a reference to the same output on future calls).

This service and factory are equivalent:

	myModule.service(""myService"", function () {
		this.whatever = true;
	});

	myModule.factory(""myFactory"", function () {
		var myFactoryObject = {};

		myFactoryObject.whatever = true;

		return myFactoryObject;
	});

Basically, when you call service, the function will be called with a particular object as its scope, and you can attach stuff to it with `this`. With a factory, you can return whatever the heck you want. Return a plain object, an array, even a function. You can probably return primitive values, too, but I've never tried that.

In practice, I always use factories because I prefer the more explicit nature of them and I prefer avoiding using `this` when possible.",1539378890.0

cyphern,"Different frameworks have different approaches. I'm most familiar with AngularJS (the 1.x version of angular) and React's techniques, so i'll describe them. I know a bit about the later versions of Angular, but am not comfortable enough to give a detailed description. 

In all cases though (or at least all that i know of), this work is done in the main thread. Webworkers cannot modify the dom, so they're of limited use. So while this work is being done, the thread is blocked. Some frameworks can mitigate this by doing a bit of work, then setting a brief timeout, then resuming work. This can let other pieces of code execute in between.

----------------------------

For angularJS , they have what they call the ""digest cycle"". They designed angularJS so that most of the time, when code starts running, it starts running in some part of the angularJS codebase. For example, a directive like `ng-click` will listen for a click event, but the entry point when that click event happens is angularJS code. Their code then calls into your custom code. Your custom code can then change values, and then you return. Since your code was called by angularJS, when you return you're resuming running their code, and they will run the digest cycle automatically. 

The digest basically means it will check through a list of variables that you've asked it to ""watch"", and if any of them has changed the DOM is updated to match. Variables can be watched either because they're on $scope, or because they're mentioned in a component binding, or because you explicitly told it to watch them, etc

Occasionally, code can start running while outside of an angular context (eg, if you do window.setTimeout), and in those cases angularJS will not know about the changes and will not update correctly unless you explicitly tell it to do the digest cycle by calling $scope.$apply. In the case of timeout specifically, they've created a service which does that for you, so by using $timeout you can do behavior like a setTimeout, but in a context that angular knows about.

--------------------------

For react, there is basically just one entry point that is used to kick off changes: a method you can call named `.setState`. State is the data that's internal to a component. When you call setState on a component, this sets in motion a series of steps. The component will call its render() method, and in the render method you take the new state and any props (props are data you get from a parent component), and then return a description of what you want the DOM to look like. This is called the ""virtual DOM"", and since it's just some fairly simple objects in memory it's much quicker to interact with than the comparatively expensive real dom. 

This stuff you return from render may include child components, into which you pass props, and so those components might have their render methods called, and so on. Eventually all the components that need to call render have done so, and react now has a description of what the DOM should look like. It then compares this with the virtual dom it got the last time it rendered, and does what they call ""reconciliation"". They find any differences between the two virtual doms, and then update the real dom with only the stuff that changed.

ElectrSheep,"State that is relevant for multiple components should be stored and managed by a service. In this case it's the JWT and the directory path. You want to create a service (henceforth called LoginService) that is responsible for 1) checking for the existing JWT and path 2) performing the actual login operation and storing the resulting JWT and path 3) informing other services and components when the state of the login changes. It should expose several methods that perform these operations. It should also expose an event that fires when the login state changes. This can easily be done using the [Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) (or by abusing the DOM's event handling mechanisms). The two components then access the single instance of the service through AngularJS's dependency injection.

So a rundown of how it all works would be as follows:

1. AngularJS app starts
2. AngularJS dependency injection container automatically creates an instance of LoginService service
3. AngularJS creates an instance of the LoginModal and ListFiles components and automatically injects the previously created LoginService instance into each
   1. Inside its constructor function, the ListFiles component registers an *event handler* (callback) with LoginService
4. AngularJS calls the $onInit *lifecyle hook* on the LoginModal component
   1. Inside $onInit, LoginModal calls a method on LoginService to check for the JWT
5. Once the LoginService acquires the JWT (either because the LoginModal asked it to check and it found a stored JWT or because the LoginModal subsequently asked it to perform a login request and it received a JWT in response) it fires the event thereby calling the previously registered event handler on ListFiles

This all sounds like much more code than it really is. Trying to make the components communicate with each other directly is not a good idea because there is no guarantee that all components that need to know about the login state of the application will be instantiated when the LoginModal chooses to inform them about that state (*especially* if you will have multiple routes).

You can further improve the structure of your app and re-usability of your components by creating a third component, moving the event handler and initial login check up into it, and adding *one-way* bindings to the existing components.

    <my-app>
        <login-modal logged-in=""$ctrl.loggedIn""></login-modal>
        <list-files ng-show=""$ctrl.loggedIn"" dir-path=""$ctrl.dirPath""></list-files>

vitriolic_amalgamati,"Well.. I can speak for part of the industry from my perspective

After the first iPhone came out, Steve Jobs began to slaughter Adobe Flash from the web.. Flash became a dirty word in the industry and the enormous community of flash professionals needed to move on to javascript frameworks in order to stay relevant and for many that meant building responsive Web apps (more importantly, ones that would also be compatible with the iPhone)

Back then there were only a few of the original mvc js frameworks to choose from (ember, backbone..) Angular was one of the newest. But it had quickly become the most popular with a large growing community, tech backed by Google and it had data binding which was a familiarity to all the flex guys flowing into the js scene. That sort of made it the only obvious choice at a time when there was a massive transition for a large swath of the Web dev community

All the flash guys at my office at the time unanimously agreed to move on to angularjs together as the company had to move towards responsive development and hang up their flash monocles once and for all

It was like this for years until any serious competition came into play.. The most successful attack vector was against angularjs's steep learning curve I believe - with react",1537706636.0

Give it a try, I have seen convinced Angular developers turn their back on Angular once they saw Svelte. Rich Harris (Rollup) came up with the idea of compiled components without a framework runtime and Svelte is in part the inspiration for Angular Elements, as Rob Wormald pointed out in his elements talk.

However, if you're interested in any of the roles that are being advertised it's still worth applying - every job change I've ever had (and most of my internal moves as well) has been to places that use languages or frameworks I'd never used before I started there.

Admittedly my last company change was 20 years ago, but I'm involved in recruitment sometimes and unless there's a need for a real expert in a given tech stack, I'd rather look for someone who can pick up new skills quickly than a one-trick pony who happens to know the framework de jour but would be useless if we changed direction.

eddiecanales,"It is a little gross, but mainly just because you're trying to have the 2 frameworks share code. I'm not sure there's much you can do to get around that.

One suggestion I might make is that, if you can, you should make your properties more explicit and not just set `$injector` as a property. Instead, with this component as an example, you should at least set `contractId` and `contractService` as properties on the component. I might even argue that what you should really set is a property called `contract` instead. Something else should be responsible for fetching the contract info and giving it to this component that should only care about rendering it. And if it needs to be able to submit updates to the contract (given that I assume this is meant to edit and save changes to the contract), then you can also assign a property called `onSave` or something like that, which you would call when your save button is clicked (this is taken from the idea of ""lifting state"" in React).

There are a few advantages that I can think of related to this:

1. You can easily build the rendering of this component in isolation (could even be done in react-storybook for example) and it will make it easier to pass in several variations of what a contract might look like to see how it behaves.
2. You can keep your high-level state management in one place. For now that's in angular, but over time you would manage fetching that contract in a page-level like component in react. And who knows what that service.updateContract call might do. This way, angular is the only one concerned with that and any changes that it might make to the contract, will make it back to your component by way of a property update, which will naturally trigger a re-render of your component.
3. You can be more clear about what is expected for each property by leveraging PropTypes. You can even go down to the level of defining the ""shape"" of a contract object.

The other commenter has linked to documentation that is relevant to Angular 2+ (now ver. 6), but in the OP you discuss controllers which makes me think you are referring to AngularJS (ver 1 of angular). They are entirely different beasts as I'm sure you've heard.

EDIT - I will add that , in general, Angular was created by Google primarily for modularity, maintainability and scalability within large enterprise codebases. Sometimes, in pursuit of those goals, it leads to coders needing to write less code. Sometimes, in pursuit of those goals, it leads to coders needing to write more code.

First thing i did, i went to angularjs’s website to understand what im dealing with. Than, watching CRUD operations on youtube helped me a lot. There are great indian programmers on youtube who explain everything about what actually angular is and how to CRUD in angular. 

After that i create a small database to CRUD. Trust me that youtube videos helped me a lot. After a month i got my confidence. 

Right now it’s my 5th month and there is still a lot to learn but i really really loved angularjs. Give it a litte bit more. Be patient. At the beginning its rly confusing i know. I worked on java for 4 year. Where i am right now compility different but i loved angular.

kordhell_,"I get where you are in your angularjs progression. My advice is to not forget entirely controllers but focus heavily on components based architecture. You won't need any $watch this way because of the managed lifecycle (google it). 


For the tight coupling in templates I can't see any practical way to make it more generic beside using a shit ton of NG template directive, beside few cases consider that your template is riveted to your component and that's OK.


Using events to communicate across your app is one solution, you can also cascade callback/promises between components or use some kind of state manager that handle dependencies and plug your components in it.

tshoecr1,"Sigh, if you are trying to build a small little app, angular makes no sense. If you’re building an app that has multiple developers, it has to survive multiple generations of developers, and you have multiple internal/external apps that you are building then It’s a hard argument to say angular isn’t what you should use. 

Since it’s a framework it heavily encourages a single organization strategy to use, this is so great if your organization is building multiple apps and you need to be able to switch between them and have the code look and feel the same. 

If your argument for state is “react has redux so it’s better” then you really didn’t understand what redux is. Yes it’s a library thats used with react, but it’s also a state management strategy that can be implemented anywhere. Angular has multiple popular redux implementations.

I didn’t understand the rambling about components being reused, you just insert the selector into the html and you’re done. Seems the author got confused with dynamic components, which is more confusing, but I believe there is docs for it and when Ive done it it isn’t bad. 

If you dont understand the goal of why you chose a framework, then complain about that framework, then take a step back and understand the requirments of what you’re building and why. Ive found angular to be a godsend as my team has triples in size and the apps we maintain has triples along with it. We can reuse modules across apps, have all redux logic contained within a module and attach to whatever module imports it (dont believe this is possible in react), and have a standard structure/libraries used across all apps.

While I love the javascript community, it feels like many like to ignore the lessons learned by other languages and communties when designing large, well made applications.

Ventajou,"Years ago, we started a new project at work and at the time I pushed for AngularJS. Because at the time we used Backbone and it was a complete mess. Over time, we upgraded our code to TypeScript, added decorators to help declare things like services and components, rewrote our build scripts a few times, created a couple more apps... We even hacked our way to using \`async/await\`.

&#x200B;

There are a couple of things that I feel stuck with: the digest cycle and the lack of type checking in templates. But overall, I don't feel limited by the framework and I can build any feature I want. I've not encountered performance issues I could blame directly on the framework with no way to mitigate them (with lazy rendering for example).

&#x200B;

I've also worked on a couple of small Angular 4 projects, which gave me an opportunity to get a feel for the evolution. And while the first class support for TypeScript is great, my impression was that there is more boilerplate code with 2+ than with 1.x and the whole experience didn't feel like an improvement overall. So I have no real incentive to sink time into upgrading the few apps we have at work. 

&#x200B;

In fact, the only compelling reason I can think of is when it comes to hiring people. And it's just a guess there but I'm thinking it will be harder and harder to convince people to come work for us knowing the apps are written in AngularJS.

The design you have is closely coupling your Angular code to view templates the Angular code has no knowledge or visibility over. If the feature you’re developing is just incidental functionality (for example, maybe it’s to create a glossary pop-up of some sort) then you can create any type of JavaScript hack to get that running—even using a timer and quertselectorall after rendering your component. 

However, if the html you’re loading is integral to the functionality of your app, I urge you to redesign your architecture so that the templates are defined at the same level as your component so that your developers have complete visibility into the template code and so that the coupling is explicit instead of implicit.

I am curious if you've ever developed an app using Ionic and published it to the Google Play Store and App Store.  I have and it was not a pleasant experience.  This article lists all the reasons you should use Ionic, but it doesn't mention when you shouldn't.  If the app you're developing has functionality that is more than a standard website you should not use Ionic.  Ionic is fine, I don't mean to rip it apart or anything and I haven't tried the version for Angular 2+.     


I would imagine developing an Ionic app with AngularJS is pretty rough at this point as it's being maintained a lot less than the newer Ionic with Angular 2+.  Though I understand AngularJS is still supported, I just highly doubt there's much of a community around it anymore.  

I developed the app about two years ago and the amount of times I had to fork a repo and change it up to make it work was frustrating.  I had to debug the source code of the package I used to get push notifications and make some changes so it would work.  I can't think of other examples where I had to do this, but I had to do a lot of things that felt very hacky to get it to work.

It's nice that it renders the UI elements of each platform but that comes at a cost as well.  You need to relentlessly test everything on both platforms, sometimes adding code to make it work on one of them.  Though I'm glad I finished the app, in hindsight, I just would have done both natively.  Performance would have been better and I genuinely believe I would have spent less time writing two codebases then I spent fighting the framework to do what I want.

I would only consider using a hybrid framework if the app is a simple web application.  Any functionality beyond that I would strongly advise against using Ionic or any other hybrid framework.  To be fair, I can't speak for the newer version of Ionic, but I don't imagine it's much different.",1533904823.0

boompleetz,"The early days v1 were messy as it added too many APIs for too many ways to do things. I would say 2 way binding is a problem more in the context of scope soup, back when $scope was king and before getting streamlined down to \`this\` in 1.5 components. Of course React's out of the box architecture would be better compared to having a bunch of unclear hierarchical relationships in templates. But there were ways around this even pre 1.5. 

After v1.5 introduced the one way \`<\` component binding (borrowing from React), and the component syntax, devs can easily use a component-based architecture. I saw some discussion between React devs the other day mentioning the main issue that often comes up for them is communication between components at various depths, i.e. do you pass a prop through every layer or have some stateful injection. Angular 1 already solved this problem with services. The problem was the ""good parts"" were not baked into the default APIs but required keeping up with best practices as they evolved over time. So there could be huge variance in the quality of Angular code depending on when it was written and how disciplined or 'literate' the team was in Angular best practices. You could argue that is the same with all code, but beginner ramp up and developer productivity are strongly affected by sensible defaults.

Still, I would argue the decline in Angular's popularity was more due to the botched release of v2 than any actual feature of the framework. It had such market dominance and buy-in, that they could have easily stayed at the top by cannibalising whatever new features were introduced in other frameworks. The problem was 1) v2 is a totally different framework with a painful migration path, 2) it took way too long to release. From my POV, problem 1 emerged from 2 and 2 happened because of a screw up with the router.

Everyone was sensitive to needing a robust native router since in v1 it was mostly useless for real apps and was removed from the core (all hail to ui-router). But Google placed this burden on some newbie engineer who never worked on routers before, resulting in garbage after a year, which they threw out and re-wrote 2 weeks before some big conference. This was of course also garbage, so a third one had to be made. In this time period, teams writing new projects were left now with a choice: wait for some unknown new ng framework, or look at alternatives. Then of course with all the extra time waiting for the router, instead of working on a sensible migration path, the API for v2 just blew up as they worked to cram every possible feature in. So all of the simplication and lessons from v2 were mostly thrown out the window and users had little reason to upgrade unless they believed the early talk about easy migration.",1531099375.0

compubomb,"2-way data-binding, using ng-model I believe, it's primary drawback was it does not scale when using large rendering tables / ng-repeat. Ironic though is that that problem was mitigated if you use something called a virtual scroll. This would eliminate the massive number of dom elements rendered to the dom, and so some trickery with view ports & pushing the dataset inside that viewport down with padding / positioning. It's still used in react, angular2+, and vuejs. It's a design pattern that will be around for a long time to come since it helps with swap thrashing. Dom elements are recycled and values are only replaced.

All the new frameworks an still do 2-way data-binding, they just go about doing it differently, and not explicitly doing it for you now. That is why if you use `[(ngModel)]` in angular, you have to import that specifically. Vue.js gives that to you if you want it. v-model is 2-way binding I believe.

Anyways.. angular1.x couldn't cut it since it introduced a lot of patterns which people abused like crazy in very large systems, it also didn't play well with doing transpilation processes like the newer frameworks do now. `.jsx` `React` files, `.vue` `Vue` files,  and the way angular handles things internally as well, all kind of work the same now, just React is a loosely coupled Community idiomatic framework, where Vue & Angular2+ you're expected by the framework to use specific libraries.

That being said it is still a good framework that will survive well beyond 3 years, someone will most likely create a fork that endures as so many developers like working with AngularJS.

To answer your question, I believe the design driving force has been to componentizing UI elements for re-use more than worrying about the bindings. Both ReactJS and Angular 2-6 take this approach. The two-way binding method you refer to is known as MVVM (Model-View View-Model) pattern. Using ReactJS, this is the first functionality I code myself now since the native ReactJS state doesn't support this binding out of the box.

Asmor,"It doesn't. Angular sets up its own event listeners. I don't know if it just sets up one that listens to all clicks on the whole page or if it sets up an event for every element it tracks, but that's what it does.

As far as how it keeps things in sync, there are two things happening.

1. Changes by the user are handled with events (keydown, for example, to detect changes on inputs).
2. Changes in JS are handled by running the digest loop every time any angular logic is run.

Notably, if you ever do anything outside the digest loop (e.g. by setting up your own event handlers manually), Angular won't detect those changes until the next time the digest loop is run (which is why you need to manually run the digest loop if you're handling something yourself).

Remember, no JS library is magic. They all run using the exact same tools that you already have access to.

prof_hobart,">Firstly, why do you need to have a store in your client side at all? Is that not what the Database is for? 

A client-side cache is there to improve performance - faster client responses, less server load and less fragile to intermittent networks. If you don't need any of that, you possibly don't need a client cache. There's absolutely nothing in React's structure that prevents you pulling the required state from the server on ever page navigation. And there's nothing to stop you using the browser cache if that's what you want to do. But that's a lot more complex than simply building up a client-side model of the data your app needs.

>If we make multiple requests to the server in quick succession, the Redux store has no way of knowing in what order these were made and given that they can return in any order, it is quite possible that the page we are looking at could be overwritten by the data from an old request!

If you're doing multiple async calls at the same time that can return contradictory data, then yes this is something you're going to deal with. But I'm not sure how that's got anything to do with React - it's been true as long as I've been working on async. There's things that you can do to help, but again mostly nothing language-specific, such as

 - redesign your system so that you don't have this possibility (it's the kind of thing that backend-for-frontend orchestration tiers are there to help with - create a single server-side endpoint that pulls data from multiple sources and returns it in one go)
 - have your client-side logic know which data should take precedent, whether based on which call it was, what the timestamp of the call was, or something else
 - wait for call A to come back before kicking off call B

There's things that libraries can help with (redux-saga, for instance, makes some of the coordination easier), but fundamentally these are just basic problems of asynchronous traffic - if you do two simultaneous calls, you've got no direct control over what order they'll come back in. Or is there something magical that Angular does to make this go away?

> working out what is the current state and what is old state involves a lot of error prone work.

Don't understand what you mean. If you're designed your model badly, or don't understand the nature of your server interactions, then yes you're going to have problems. But in a well-designed app, this is one of the things that Redux makes ridiculously easy - take the current state and apply a transformation to it based on the most recent action and produce a new state. It's basically functional programming, making it easy to both reason about and test.

>In React, you have to pass any dependencies down to components through props which can mean that a component has props that it doesn't actually use itself but just has them so it can pass them down to child components.

This is one of the other things that Redux makes very easy - at the appropriate point in your component hierarchy, pull out the bits of state (and potential actions) that it needs to worry about and pass them as params.

>The next problem with React is that it does not support Dependency Injection

It doesn't have a whole framework around dependency injection, no. But there's nothing stopping you simply injecting your dependencies through parameters if that's what you want to do. 

There's plenty of problems with React. But most of these seem little to do with React at all and the ones that do seem to be based on a flawed understanding of what it provides.
",1530373777.0
ianwcarlson,"Most of the arguments against React are valid, but they ignore the advantages of React and are assuming the context is a green-field app. Angular is very opinionated and difficult to start incrementally introducing it into the frontend. There are still lots of Jquery apps out there. Using React makes the transition very flexible and easy.

Dependency injection has downsides too. In order to consume anything, like a third-party GIS mapping library for example, that isn't included in the canonical set, it needs to be wrapped in code to be consumable into the DI framework. This is potentially significant boilerplate to add if the app has dependencies that aren't included in the core libs. Since React just uses ES6 modules, most third-party libs are immediately consumable.

I think the argument about React devs having to piece together third-party libs has merit, but is overstated. React, Redux, React-router are pretty tightly coupled in terms of compatibility (React-router a little less so). Also, there is some really bomb-ass stuff like Jest, that you'd be missing out on if you're set on canonical.

React is the only major frontend library that puts HTML into Javascript. I can't stress how significant this is. All the other ones put JS into HTML. Doing it the non-React way creates custom DSLs that all have their own way of repeating a snippet of HTML or conditionally displaying something. JSX is just HTML folks. It's 99% faithful, just slightly syntactically different. 

Because React is 100% JS, it's inherently capable of very powerful things: i.e., [higher-order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) or functions that return functions/components. HOCs provide a pattern for mixins, but also allows the code to bind values to a component via a closure so that code can be heavily re-used, and configured different during the bootstrap phase of the app. For example, you can configure HOCs to map to different parts of the Redux state without modifying the HOC itself. This is very useful for reusable components that store state in Redux.

I actually generally agree with your arguments about React and Redux, but I don't think you provide the full picture. Lots of apps aren't green-field. This is where a incremental transition to something else is easier with less opinionated libraries.

All major frontend frameworks are very capable of building a solid, maintainable UI. Whenever someone tells me they're rewriting their entire frontend from Angular to React (or vice versa) I cringe. To the users and the stakeholders, the framework doesn't matter, but spending 3 months not pushing features does.

Alternatively, if you are happy to use hash routing, you can enable it in your Angular app like so:

BillyBBone,"What's happening here is that, when your Angular app is loaded in a web browser, it is intercepting the navigation instructions that are being generated from links and buttons and the like.

So, normally, if you have just a static HTML page, and someone clicks a link with an `href=""/about""`, then the browser is going to try requesting the URL `https://yourdomain.com/about` by connecting to `yourdomain.com`, and making an HTTP GET request for the resource named `/about`. The server will either serve that page, or return an error message of some description, like 404.

When an Angular app is loaded in the browser, however, clicking on the same link will first cause that resource request to be ""served"" by Angular's routing methods. If your Angular app has a route defined for `/about`, then there's no need for the web browser to bother the web server -- the necessary resource is injected into the DOM via Angular, and the request terminates there.

As you noted, refreshing the browser causes a 404 error. Why is that? Well, by refreshing the web browser, you are asking it to ""clear everything in active memory, and replace it with whatever can be found under `https://yourdomain.com/about`.

Since the Angular app isn't loaded (you asked the browser to empty its memory!), the routing interception mechanism isn't in place, and so the web browser simply does what it does best: it will issue an HTTP GET request for a resource which doesn't exist.

There are two options for solving this problem:

1. As noted by vaskemaskine, you can modify your backend server configuration to rewrite such ""application route"" URLs to serve the Angular application first, and *then* use the Angular routing mechanism to navigate to the proper page within the Single Page App.

2. You can also use hash-based routing, which is a clever workaround to this problem. Essentially, what this does is add a `#` character in your application's URL, so that anything on the left of the hash represents the URL where the actual Angular application can be loaded, and everything on the right represents the internal path that the Angular app should navigate to, once the app framework is loaded.

Both schemes have advantages and disadvantages; you'll need to pick which one is right for you. For instance, the first scheme is more obfuscated, in that it make more effort to pretend that you are serving a vanilla HTML site with different URLs that lead to static content. Search engines, URL shorteners and other web services can treat the URLs that are created by your application just like it would treat any other URLs. The disadvantage is that it requires some duplication of route information, and a bit more server-side configuration.

The second scheme has the advantage of being more portable (in that you can use it on any web server without custom redirect configuration). It has some disadvantages, however. For instance, you can't use MORE than one hash in a URL, so you'd never be able to link to a piece of content *within* a view, for instance: `https://yourdomain.com/#/vision#environmental-impact`. Depending on what you're trying to build, this could be prohibitive. (For instance, imagine if Wikipedia adopted this scheme, and made it impossible to link to sections in individual articles?)

If you've been working with TypeScript, RxJS etc. you've been using the ""new"" version (which has been around for 2 years already). AngularJS is discontinued and has entered LTS (Long Term Support), which means that very significant bugs (like security) will be fixed, but that's it. 

If you did get your naming right, then I hope you can convince your new boss to consider upgrading to Angular and slowly phase out AngularJS. It'll be quite painful to start learning AngularJS if you're used to Angular right now, as the used techniques and general architecture are very hard to compare.

ArguingEnginerd,What's the browser compatibility?,1523453570.0
selfoscillation,"So here’s the deal. When you go to a website, the browser has to fetch and parse the html in index.html that is on the server. Most apps built with frameworks such as Angular and React, have a single div element with an id with nothing in it. The browser then has to load the bundled js to even show on the screen. So at this point that’s 2 full round trips to the server before anything is shown on the screen. Sure you can show a spinner or something in your first render, but that’s somewhat outdated in terms of SSR. 

To answer your question, the reason SSR is important is because it allows you to pass a decent amount of html that will show a wireframe or page outline that can be interactive while the rest of the code in your bundle is fetched and rendered. It’s especially useful when you realize most web traffic is mobile and not everyone in the world has fast internet. You can still have your app in AngularJS or any js framework you want. You can set up SSR using express or your server framework of choice by passing interactive html in the initial render while ‘asynchronously’ loading your bundled js.

Active record isn’t a bad idea if you’re having problems keeping things organized. I’d suggest coming up with a standard to denote which methods return a promise/contact the api. 

E.g. rename “addFriend” to “addFriend$” or “_apiAddFriend”. 

This will 1) make it more clear this is not a synchronous method on the User object, and 2) prevent clobbers when your constructor blindly extends the current object with non-validated data.  It would be better to only copy over expected properties, but maybe you don’t have a case where this is yet needed. 

I worked on an enterprise angular application for 3+ years. Project was started the day angular 1.2 was released so we did a lot of things poorly simply because nobody really knew what to do yet. All our API calls were in one gigantic service. 1200+ lines. It was dreadful, but we never had any dependency issues.

I am pretty sure if you write down all your services,  you’ll be able to correct most of your issues. You will also be able to quickly detect most of the circular dependencies you have so you won't have to rely too much on the dynamic injection.
For instance:
SomethingService1, what is its purpose? What does it provide to the other entities? Is it the correct name? Is it too generic? What depends on it?

More companies are re-writing their apps with the latest Angular. Architecture-wise, AngularJs and Angular are similar in the sense that both frameworks build apps with modules, components, directives, and services. But the similarities end there. The syntax is completely different between the two, and Angular 5 offers way more tools to help you build any web app you want. Google wants to call Angular a platform rather than a framework. You get everything you could possibly want to build a mature, enterprise level SPA. Static type checking through Typescript, routing, lazy-loading, testing, localization, server-side rendering, service worker, animation, etc.

Switching from AngularJs to VueJs is way easier than switching to Angular2345. You don’t have to learn TypeScript, you don’t have to rethink the whole framework completely and to be honest, Vue is extremely enjoyable to work with. You’re actually still coding with JavaScript
I see Angular like a product in decline, and I believe you can see the trend happening statistically. TypeScript is complete nonsense (in my opinion). Some developers of other oriented languages wanted to bring the specificities of their language to JavaScript instead of embracing it, thinking their way was a superior one. They did that to Php, making it look like a huge mess, plugging all nonsense coming from other languages an now people turn to... NodeJs. Another enjoyable tools to develop with (given that you’re going to use ES5, ES6, NPM, Express, etc).
The future of Web Development is most certainly not bound to Angular and it’s way of doing thing.

This takes a significant amount of work off the runtime engine as the interpreter doesn't need to worry about compiling any assets before the content is ultimately rendered.

It makes performing things like forEach loops or array manipulation easier. I used it in static one-page websites who's content was not driven by any type of back-end API.

Angular (And other similar frameworks) is a completely different solution. As the article states, it provides a very simple and efficient means of combining back-end data with front-end logic. Angular should not be used for basic DOM manipulation or performing a forEach loop or some kind of array manipulation.

A good example of this was when I needed to add cascading drop-downs to a SharePoint list. The library I used required jQuery as a dependency and was as simple as dropping a few files into place and including them in the creation form with 10 lines of JS. Angular cannot do that.

jQuery is still relevant and useful by itself and when combined with other projects and keeps a gap filled (When a project is not really on the scale that angular is needed).

randomguy3993,"Hi. First of all, i believe, it is more important for you to understand how angular and JavaScript work under the hood. Once you get a hold of that, you won't have to worry about versions (unless you're changing from 1.x to 2 or higher - lots of changee).

I guess that makes me a lousy corporate shill :-) ).

There is a struggle for students around ""which version of AngularJS, which generation of AngularJS approach?"". We've updated our curriculum to what we think is a reasonably ideal and mature point to pick up AngularJS 1.x today. A relatively modern approach to AngularJS. 1.6. Components, ES2015 classes, etc.

The problem is...  most students are planning to join some existing project that has been around a while, a project which probably does not use AngularJS in the exact way we show in class. They probably use some different point release, they do some things in an older way, etc. So even though I think we do a quite good job teaching it, nonetheless depending on local practices where a student works, sometimes they need to do quite a bit of research afterward to understand the nuances between the modern approach we taught, versus the practices in use on a older, large system.

(We do a lot of corporate training...  where of course it is easier to adjust things to talk about older practices or whatever. But this doesn't help an individual like the OP at all, and nowadays the great bulk of teams learning Angular are learning version 5, not version 1.x!)

axolotlotoloxa,"I don't think I've ever encountered an ""Enterprise Framework"" I enjoy working with regardless of language / stack - .NET, Java, JavaScript - doesn't matter.  Angular is an Enterprise Framework. 

More often than not - they get in the way, and you end up solving framework problems, not business problems. 

They at times can make the complex simple, but make simple very complex. Most needs, are more simple than you think - and probably don't justify the complexity that the framework brings along with it. Angular is an Enterprise Framework - both in the good, and bad connotations of ""Enterprise Framework"" 

If your complex does not fit within their pattern - the complex becomes a mess, as you end up fighting with the tool instead of working with it. 

It can still the right tool for some jobs/applications. I'll work with it if I need to, but if given a say/influence over the choice of framework - the scenarios of which Angular comes out on top is getting smaller and smaller, and the factors of which I'd say yes to Angular as a whole lot of ""it depends...."" attached. 

It has its place - it's not going away, and for some teams / environments - it is the right choice. 

But blindly buying into ""it's enterprise ready"" - and assuming that you can magically turn a team of old-school / back end devs that know .NET/MVC or Java/Spring into front-end/full-stack devs within a week just because the syntax looks close enough is highly misguided.

If anything - it's detrimental. When trying to make the transition - it doesn't encourage the ""novice mindset"" enough. Mental models / assumptions that carry over from say C#/Java - look close enough to TypeScript/Angular - that you don't fall back to re-learn base level assumptions, and that ends up burning you. 

The async nature of JavaScript still messes people up - and the struggle / hacks / escape hatches that people try to do to make async act like sync code - and at times ends up working by accident and by not intent is well... *sigh*

Or the concept of functions being first class citizens - functions can take functions as arguments, and/or return functions. You can get the same results that you would rely on convoluted OOP structure where you get a gorilla holding a banana for an error logger, or a too auto-magical DI system (dependency inversion = yes, much yes, dependency injection frameworks - it depends).

Toss in the differences between classical inheritance vs prototype inheritance, the context of 'this' still being unclear:

     class SomeClass {
         someMethod() { }
         anotherMethod = () => { }
     } 

ES6 and fat-arrows helped a lot with the 'this' problem - but then also added Classes - but class methods can still lead to 'this' problems. Yes, this is a bit of a gripe about ES6 in general - but when TypeScript looks close enough to C#/Java - and how class-centric Angular is - that lots of people don't grok the difference between `someMethod() { }` and `anotherMethod = () => { }`. When that leads to a bug - tends to result in a pile-on of shitty-band aid code - instead of stepping back to consider ""Hey, maybe I just need to understand JavaScript a bit better"" - and solve the root of the problem, not add another bandaid to the 50 layers on top. 

Note: Some of this is not due to Angular itself - but the perception of it, without doing due diligence before adopting it.

I can be/am very productive with it (although at times it feels like despite it, not because of it) - and there are some situations where I think it is the right choice - but it's not the ""easy yes"" people seem to think it is.

* I believe almost all resources use typescript
* I guess most new projects use webpack or the CLI which I believe you can eject from to get the webpack config
* State management depends on what you/the company uses (if not just the native stuff), but for me the react state management concepts also work very well with Angular. Otherwise looking into services, dependency injection, change detection and observables should be a good way to get up to speed.
* I don't think ignoring decorators is a good strategy, does the company use decorators? I am pretty sure that almost all resources use them because they are the standard. What are your concerns with them? They are basically just config objects that describe the component and marks stuff for the framework. 

I use both (currently more react) and the basic structures of my projects look very similar. Dumb vs smart components (or however you want to call them) can still be applied, props are very similar with the difference that event handlers are defined and passed differently. The thing that currently lets me favour react over angular is that angular is less flexible. Everything has to fit into its module system, which for example makes dynamic component creation (e.g. styled-components) a lot harder. ",1517330819.0

Not from a user perspective. But from the perspective of another programmer that would come across your architecture and code.

> All AngularJS modules.js, directive.js, controllers.js services.js and views.js live inside a PostgreSQL database instead of a static directory. 

Yikes! How are you going to use standard tools like `grep`, your favorite IDE, or even `git`? What are you doing to keep track of revisions of that source? Can I use a tool like `kdiff3` or my favorite merge tool to review and merge different versions of the same file when two programmers have changed the same file? The list of what you can do on the file system (but what goes away when you store code in a DB) is very long. One good rule of thumb when evaluating ideas like this is to ask if another programmer could have thought of and tried this idea before. Surely someone has tried putting code in a DB before? Both have been around for decades.

The most likely reason you don't find it in the wild is *not* because no one thought of it already. Most likely it's because there are problems with that solution. I'm not saying don't be afraid to *experiment* and maybe you will even discover a new way of doing things. But the key word is *experiment*. If you wanted to store code in the DB, just for example, it should be a *side project* of its own and you should be getting other programmers involved in that experiment to test it against a wide variety of scenarios to see if the idea has any merit at all.

I'm not even going to comment on most of your other choices, some of which are almost as bizarre. Only to say that the more you deviate from the standard way of writing an app, the more of a learning curve it is for other devs. For each of the decisions you've made, I would ask yourself what problem it solves and then seek out answers on how other people are already solving that problem. I haven't seen anything particular to your situation that would lead me to the architecture you've described.

>  I'm not a fan of using JavaScript in the backend and prefer something object oriented.

While choosing Python over JavaScript is not something I want to get into a religious war about here, the reason you gave is not very strong. JavaScript is an object-based language, and prototypical inheritance can often be more powerful and flexible than class-based inheritance.

EricTboneJackson,"> Angular is not simple at all.

Totally disagree. Angular 2 is very simple. You have HTML templates bound to Javascript objects. Most of it is incredibly straightfoward.

    @Component({
        selector: 'greeter',
        template: '<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>',
    })
    class Greeter {
        name = ""World"";
    }

This creates a component which you can instantiate by using the tag <greeter> which displays ""Hello World"". You could parameterize the name by simply flagging the name property as an Input with decorator:

    @Component({
        selector: 'greeter',
        template: '<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>',
    })
    class Greeter {
        @Input() name = ""World"";
    }

Now you can write something like `<greeter name='Bob'>` in your HTML. What if you want to click on the the greeter object and show a popup? Just create a click binding:

    @Component({
        selector: 'greeter',
        template: '<h1 (click)=""greet()"">Hello {{name}}</h1>',
    })
    class Greeter {
        @Input() name = ""World"";

        greet() {
            alert(`How's it going, ${this.name}!`);
        }
    }

So on and so forth. Ordinary Javascript classes bound to templates in a straightforward, readable way.

,"I’m not really sure how to answer this because Angular development is front end web development. You’re simply using a framework rather than plain JavaScript. I suppose depending on what work you did as a front end web developer that Angular could imply more of a “web app” development instead of simple websites (that’s how I’m interpreting your comment about working on “websites”). That’s probably the closest I can come to a distinction. That being said, my first job title with my current company was Front End Developer even though I worked in Angular building an app. Angular development still involves writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Because it’s usually more of an app than a simple website, there is often work with APIs (both internal and usually for external applications such as AWS or analytics) and databases. If you’re familiar with working with them and consuming them on the front end, then you should be fine. My basic answer though is that if you feel comfortable with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then all you need to do is learn the specifics of the Angular framework and you’ll be totally fine.",1515904173.0

flipper_babies,"Yeah, you've fallen victim to a couple of of Javascript's lovely gotchas. One, lack of typing, and two, overloading the `+` operator.

So first of all, the `+` means addition when dealing with numbers, and concatenation when dealing with strings:

    ""one"" + ""two""; // evaluates to ""onetwo""
    ""1"" + ""2""; // evaluates to ""12""
    1 + 2; // evaluates to 3

So there's mystery one. The other thing is type coercion. If you try to add a number and a string, the interpreter has to guess if you meant to add numbers or concatenate strings, and will convert your values depending upon its best guess. And it will guess you meant to add right up until it encounters a `string`, and will then proceed to concatenate:

    5 + 5 + ""5""; // 105
    ""5"" + 5 + 5; // 555


So when you sum your numbers, things get screwy:

    5 + 5 + """" + """" + """"; // evaluates to 10
    """" + """" + """" + 5 + 5; // evaluates to ""55""

What you need to do is keep your types straight. Make sure your `number`s are always `number`s, and it'll work out as you intend.

XPTranquility,"Angular can do most of that. The trend is you have a backend just delivering the api and the initial route. Angular then can handle routes after that. Look into the MEAN stack. People use mongo as DB, nodejs to deliver API data from that data base and express as the nodejs framework. Angular as the front end framework that does 99% of the logic you explained. ",1513953425.0
akujinhikari,"So here's the thing. Angular is Javascript, which is a front-end language. Now, you could build a whole site with just Angular and no back end, but that's a bad idea. For instance, you could have users.js which is just a json file like so:

    Users: {
      user1: {
        ""name"" : ""Bruce"",
        ""password"" : ""SupermanSucks"",
        ""permissions"" : ""admin""

        ""name"" : ""Clark"",
        ""password"" : ""ILoveLois"",
        ""permissions"" : ""user""
      }
    }

Then every time someone logs in, Angular checks the user.js for the user and logs in accordingly. This is a terrible idea, because Javascript is 100% viewable. Anyone can see this information, and that's very, very bad. That's why people use api's to handle sensitive data... or really any data. In order to use Angular, you'd typically want a RESTful API and a database, and Angular can ""ask"" for that information when needed, and then only the pertinent information is sent and received. Then Angular can take that data and do what you want with it. For instance, now that Bruce is logged in, he has access to the ""Admin"" page, but when Clark logs in, he doesn't have access. Angular can do that kind of logic (although the api should also have a failsafe from someone bypassing the use of a browser). You build the back end as an information machine, and Angular as a dispenser of information that has been deemed to be viewed by the public.",1513967302.0
foszterface,"I haven't used angular in a year or so, so take this with the requisite grain of salt. I think angular's strength is in data binding and injection: sort of a bridge between the backend and the nearly static html at the front.

oowowaee,"So for example the ""what to show when a user logs in"" really depends on the data.  You could have Angular only display the admin edit controls for admin users, but what if I bypass your interface?  If you're not also checking permissions and authorization on the server side, what's preventing me from updating/viewing data you're filtering out with Angular?

Any front end framework is just consuming and displaying an interface for interactions with the server (or the original data source).  If you want to persist data to a server, you will obviously  need a backend, and that backend also needs to be in control of who and how data is being accessed.

Edit for explicitness:
If you're serving Angular data from a REST API, if you are the owner of that API, you need a backend.

You also need something to serve your site, but that could be pretty minimal, so I am ignoring that.

However, you can directly reference the model if you put it on a named controller. Further, you can attach a reference to the model onto the controller to still use 'this'. If it is a component or directive, you should be passing a reference in the markup if you want it to be reusable.

I can try to help more if you can give us a jsfiddle/codepen/whatever.

AngularJS was seriously arcane and difficult to work with for a long time. A lot of its patterns were a little too far ahead of their time and lacked refinement, and eventually were even behind the times and even more in the way. You'd often end up in a total mess trying to figure out how to do something ""the Angular way."" I can't tell you how much hair I tore out trying to get transclusion to work the way I wanted it to before I learned the best patterns and use cases for it, and it made a huge difference.

The learning curve was always the primary complaint with most people who give up on AngularJS, but loads of large and important apps quietly run it today.

,"I can't seem to see your examples on mobile, but I will try to answer, and hopefully it is not irrelevant. To get the inputs working on a structural directive, you are going to want to prefix the variable name with the directive selector. So if you have a structural directive with the selector ""myAwesomeDirective"", change this:

    @Input()
    myStuff;

To this:

    @Input()
    myAwesomeDirectiveMyStuff;

Then, you have to reference the variables online to use them by putting an asterisk before the selector, then putting the default input as the first element in the binding, then a semicolon separated list of the input names WITHOUT the selector name in front of them, and with no equals:

    <div *myAwesomeDirective=""foo; myStuff bar""></div>

In your case, the reason you’re seeing the results you are when the page loads is because the function is being invoked at runtime instead of only being invoked as the result of a click. Even though you’re passing `buttonClick()` to `ng-click`, because you’re calling the function, it will be invoked when the controller is instantiated—when the page loads.

If you want to defer the function call to when the button is clicked, you can either wrap it in an anonymous function or bind the function arguments to the function you would like to call.

prof_hobart,">Firstly, why do you need to have a store in your client side at all? Is that not what the Database is for? 

A client-side cache is there to improve performance - faster client responses, less server load and less fragile to intermittent networks. If you don't need any of that, you possibly don't need a client cache. There's absolutely nothing in React's structure that prevents you pulling the required state from the server on ever page navigation. And there's nothing to stop you using the browser cache if that's what you want to do. But that's a lot more complex than simply building up a client-side model of the data your app needs.

>If we make multiple requests to the server in quick succession, the Redux store has no way of knowing in what order these were made and given that they can return in any order, it is quite possible that the page we are looking at could be overwritten by the data from an old request!

If you're doing multiple async calls at the same time that can return contradictory data, then yes this is something you're going to deal with. But I'm not sure how that's got anything to do with React - it's been true as long as I've been working on async. There's things that you can do to help, but again mostly nothing language-specific, such as

 - redesign your system so that you don't have this possibility (it's the kind of thing that backend-for-frontend orchestration tiers are there to help with - create a single server-side endpoint that pulls data from multiple sources and returns it in one go)
 - have your client-side logic know which data should take precedent, whether based on which call it was, what the timestamp of the call was, or something else
 - wait for call A to come back before kicking off call B

There's things that libraries can help with (redux-saga, for instance, makes some of the coordination easier), but fundamentally these are just basic problems of asynchronous traffic - if you do two simultaneous calls, you've got no direct control over what order they'll come back in. Or is there something magical that Angular does to make this go away?

> working out what is the current state and what is old state involves a lot of error prone work.

Don't understand what you mean. If you're designed your model badly, or don't understand the nature of your server interactions, then yes you're going to have problems. But in a well-designed app, this is one of the things that Redux makes ridiculously easy - take the current state and apply a transformation to it based on the most recent action and produce a new state. It's basically functional programming, making it easy to both reason about and test.

>In React, you have to pass any dependencies down to components through props which can mean that a component has props that it doesn't actually use itself but just has them so it can pass them down to child components.

This is one of the other things that Redux makes very easy - at the appropriate point in your component hierarchy, pull out the bits of state (and potential actions) that it needs to worry about and pass them as params.

>The next problem with React is that it does not support Dependency Injection

It doesn't have a whole framework around dependency injection, no. But there's nothing stopping you simply injecting your dependencies through parameters if that's what you want to do. 

There's plenty of problems with React. But most of these seem little to do with React at all and the ones that do seem to be based on a flawed understanding of what it provides.
",1530373777.0
ianwcarlson,"Most of the arguments against React are valid, but they ignore the advantages of React and are assuming the context is a green-field app. Angular is very opinionated and difficult to start incrementally introducing it into the frontend. There are still lots of Jquery apps out there. Using React makes the transition very flexible and easy.

Dependency injection has downsides too. In order to consume anything, like a third-party GIS mapping library for example, that isn't included in the canonical set, it needs to be wrapped in code to be consumable into the DI framework. This is potentially significant boilerplate to add if the app has dependencies that aren't included in the core libs. Since React just uses ES6 modules, most third-party libs are immediately consumable.

I think the argument about React devs having to piece together third-party libs has merit, but is overstated. React, Redux, React-router are pretty tightly coupled in terms of compatibility (React-router a little less so). Also, there is some really bomb-ass stuff like Jest, that you'd be missing out on if you're set on canonical.

React is the only major frontend library that puts HTML into Javascript. I can't stress how significant this is. All the other ones put JS into HTML. Doing it the non-React way creates custom DSLs that all have their own way of repeating a snippet of HTML or conditionally displaying something. JSX is just HTML folks. It's 99% faithful, just slightly syntactically different. 

Because React is 100% JS, it's inherently capable of very powerful things: i.e., [higher-order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) or functions that return functions/components. HOCs provide a pattern for mixins, but also allows the code to bind values to a component via a closure so that code can be heavily re-used, and configured different during the bootstrap phase of the app. For example, you can configure HOCs to map to different parts of the Redux state without modifying the HOC itself. This is very useful for reusable components that store state in Redux.

I actually generally agree with your arguments about React and Redux, but I don't think you provide the full picture. Lots of apps aren't green-field. This is where a incremental transition to something else is easier with less opinionated libraries.

All major frontend frameworks are very capable of building a solid, maintainable UI. Whenever someone tells me they're rewriting their entire frontend from Angular to React (or vice versa) I cringe. To the users and the stakeholders, the framework doesn't matter, but spending 3 months not pushing features does.

lonehiker,"If you are doing routing in the client side, this is expected. Routing in the client doesn't work over a page reload because the reload is asking the server for that page bypassing the client side app. ",1527393762.0
BillyBBone,"What's happening here is that, when your Angular app is loaded in a web browser, it is intercepting the navigation instructions that are being generated from links and buttons and the like.

So, normally, if you have just a static HTML page, and someone clicks a link with an `href=""/about""`, then the browser is going to try requesting the URL `https://yourdomain.com/about` by connecting to `yourdomain.com`, and making an HTTP GET request for the resource named `/about`. The server will either serve that page, or return an error message of some description, like 404.

When an Angular app is loaded in the browser, however, clicking on the same link will first cause that resource request to be ""served"" by Angular's routing methods. If your Angular app has a route defined for `/about`, then there's no need for the web browser to bother the web server -- the necessary resource is injected into the DOM via Angular, and the request terminates there.

As you noted, refreshing the browser causes a 404 error. Why is that? Well, by refreshing the web browser, you are asking it to ""clear everything in active memory, and replace it with whatever can be found under `https://yourdomain.com/about`.

Since the Angular app isn't loaded (you asked the browser to empty its memory!), the routing interception mechanism isn't in place, and so the web browser simply does what it does best: it will issue an HTTP GET request for a resource which doesn't exist.

There are two options for solving this problem:

1. As noted by vaskemaskine, you can modify your backend server configuration to rewrite such ""application route"" URLs to serve the Angular application first, and *then* use the Angular routing mechanism to navigate to the proper page within the Single Page App.

2. You can also use hash-based routing, which is a clever workaround to this problem. Essentially, what this does is add a `#` character in your application's URL, so that anything on the left of the hash represents the URL where the actual Angular application can be loaded, and everything on the right represents the internal path that the Angular app should navigate to, once the app framework is loaded.

Both schemes have advantages and disadvantages; you'll need to pick which one is right for you. For instance, the first scheme is more obfuscated, in that it make more effort to pretend that you are serving a vanilla HTML site with different URLs that lead to static content. Search engines, URL shorteners and other web services can treat the URLs that are created by your application just like it would treat any other URLs. The disadvantage is that it requires some duplication of route information, and a bit more server-side configuration.

The second scheme has the advantage of being more portable (in that you can use it on any web server without custom redirect configuration). It has some disadvantages, however. For instance, you can't use MORE than one hash in a URL, so you'd never be able to link to a piece of content *within* a view, for instance: `https://yourdomain.com/#/vision#environmental-impact`. Depending on what you're trying to build, this could be prohibitive. (For instance, imagine if Wikipedia adopted this scheme, and made it impossible to link to sections in individual articles?)

Bjeaurn,"Are you sure you are not misunderstanding the differences? AngularJS is the predecessor from Angular (which is currently on version 6). Angular is the full rewrite of AngularJS, where they've considered and learned a lot from the things that made AngularJS badly scalable.

If you've been working with TypeScript, RxJS etc. you've been using the ""new"" version (which has been around for 2 years already). AngularJS is discontinued and has entered LTS (Long Term Support), which means that very significant bugs (like security) will be fixed, but that's it. 

If you did get your naming right, then I hope you can convince your new boss to consider upgrading to Angular and slowly phase out AngularJS. It'll be quite painful to start learning AngularJS if you're used to Angular right now, as the used techniques and general architecture are very hard to compare.

BobLoblaw321,"By using scope: {firstVisit: '=""} you've created an isolated scope with a firstVisit input. 

Also that's a directive, not a component (assuming you're using a version newer than 1.5). When using components the scope is isolated by default.

You don't have to have a controller that encapsulates your entire application. If you need to share data between components/directives, you can use a service.
",1525766979.0
wagedomain,"u/BobLoblaw321 was correct in his explanation about what's going on.

In terms of best practices, typically you want directives to have an isolated scope. This helps make them be reusable and portable. If you're relying on the parent controller a lot, you might want to ask yourself why it's a directive. If you just want the HTML to be separated out, but it has heavy dependencies on the controller, you could use ng\-include to pull the HTML in, though some people think this is confusing to read.

Another thing to look at is why you have a ""Main"" controller for the whole app. Typically this isn't great, unless you only have one page and route. If you have site\-wide things you can put them in app.js and the .run function, which will execute when the app runs, or set up services to hold or initialize data. If you put everything into a main controller, you'll start to have maintenance issues, as well as structural issues \(similar to what you're describing here with the bindings / isolated scope issues\).

Google whatever topics you find confusing, you'll find many articles/blogs - sometimes another person's way of explaining makes more sense.

Next, you can get an Angular starter project, and use it to build your own app for practice. (The reason for recommending a starter is that it will let you concentrate on Angular and skip over some configuration stuff like Webpack - but eventually you'll have to learn that too)

Also Google open source Angular component libraries and enterprise-type apps  (""ng2-admin"" is one). Helps to read other people's code.

Next learn about how to use a controller. Use the controller as syntax. Next learn about how to bind. Learn about one-way and two-way binding. Next jump into components. Write a very simple component that displays hello world or something like that. Then add some functionality. Routing should be next along with filtering. The best teacher is going to be hands-on experience so I highly recommend a project where you write code and see what happens.

eclaircissement,"Yes, this is the exact type of thing which AngularFire excels at due to its RxJS-based API.

What you want to do is retrieve the list of objects and then map each object to another observable of the 'collection_name/some_key' node in Firebase. I would note that in the Realtime Database, collections are generally referred to as ""lists"" (using the term collection implies you might be using Firestore instead of the RTDB).

    db.list('stream').valueChanges()
      .switchMap((objects) => {
        return Observable.zip(objects.map((object) => {
          return db.object(`${object.collection}/${object.key}`).valueChanges();
        });
      })
      .subscribe((array) => { // do something with array of objects here});


This will

* Observe the list of object collection names + keys located under the ""stream"" node

* Take that list of collection + key objects and map each one to an observable of the actual object location under the node given by the collection name and the key

* Do whatever you like with the array of actual objects in the subscribe block

Two very important notes:

1. Every time the ""stream"" list changes, the first observable will first and it will cascade down. For instance, if you added a new object under stream, then you will get a new array of collection/key objects which will get mapped to a new array of results. If you only want to look at the stream list once, add a `.take(1)` operator before the `switchMap` operator.

2. The use of the `zip` operator means you will only get an array of results each time all of the object observables have fired. If one of the objects is updated but the others aren't, you won't get a new array. If you want to get a new array any time any of the objects is updated, use `combineLatest` instead of `zip` - but be aware that you will get a bunch of partial arrays as it will fire each time one of the object observables returns its initial value and again for any subsequent values.

I strongly recommend reading the official RxJS docs as well as learnrxjs and RxMarbles to get a handle on how this all works since it can be tricky. The really important operators to understand are flatMap, switchMap, zip, combineLatest, take, skip, and filter.

wagedomain,"""Bootstrap"" is a term that means, essentially ""to setup or start"" or ""initialize"". 

In angularJS, the most common thing to do is automatically bootstrap the application. You typically just do 

    ng-app=""rootModule""

on an element and once the proper page lifecycle event is triggered, the app will automatically bootstrap with that module. You can also choose to manually bootstrap if you wish. I was forced to add manual bootstrapping in an angular 1\+4 hybrid application for example, as angular 4 wasn't able to recognize ng\-app tags, but did understand the angular.bootstrap command.

The computer would start operating from that address when it was powered on, then run each instruction in sequence.

It was called IPLing or initial program load but that was not a snappy thing to say.  So, the act of starting the computer eventually became known as bootstrapping or booting for short.

ArguingEnginerd,What's the browser compatibility?,1523453570.0
selfoscillation,"So here’s the deal. When you go to a website, the browser has to fetch and parse the html in index.html that is on the server. Most apps built with frameworks such as Angular and React, have a single div element with an id with nothing in it. The browser then has to load the bundled js to even show on the screen. So at this point that’s 2 full round trips to the server before anything is shown on the screen. Sure you can show a spinner or something in your first render, but that’s somewhat outdated in terms of SSR. 

To answer your question, the reason SSR is important is because it allows you to pass a decent amount of html that will show a wireframe or page outline that can be interactive while the rest of the code in your bundle is fetched and rendered. It’s especially useful when you realize most web traffic is mobile and not everyone in the world has fast internet. You can still have your app in AngularJS or any js framework you want. You can set up SSR using express or your server framework of choice by passing interactive html in the initial render while ‘asynchronously’ loading your bundled js.

It would be better to only copy over expected properties, but maybe you don’t have a case where this is yet needed. 

I worked on an enterprise angular application for 3+ years. Project was started the day angular 1.2 was released so we did a lot of things poorly simply because nobody really knew what to do yet. All our API calls were in one gigantic service. 1200+ lines. It was dreadful, but we never had any dependency issues. 

As to how to solve your circular issues, you can always inject `$injector` and get an instance of whatever you need at run time rather than at provide time. Just ensure the current module requires that module. ",1522988997.0

* Review/Rename the name of the services that are unclear to the devs. So they have a better understanding of what does what. It’s important to write them all down and do some cleaning.
* Why would you have a user service? A user is part of a model and therefore should be defined as an object (that some services will know how to use).

I am pretty sure if you write down all your services,  you’ll be able to correct most of your issues. You will also be able to quickly detect most of the circular dependencies you have so you won't have to rely too much on the dynamic injection.
For instance:
SomethingService1, what is its purpose? What does it provide to the other entities? Is it the correct name? Is it too generic? What depends on it? Then document the code accordingly (the comment at the top of your service that describes it so others know it’s definitely where a method should be added).

Even if your service is significant, they’re always going to find the method they need because it ”makes sense.”

>Is it now a safe pick or is this the time to move on?

More companies are re-writing their apps with the latest Angular. Architecture-wise, AngularJs and Angular are similar in the sense that both frameworks build apps with modules, components, directives, and services. But the similarities end there. The syntax is completely different between the two, and Angular 5 offers way more tools to help you build any web app you want. Google wants to call Angular a platform rather than a framework. You get everything you could possibly want to build a mature, enterprise level SPA. Static type checking through Typescript, routing, lazy-loading, testing, localization, server-side rendering, service worker, animation, etc.

> Is this made only so one could migrate to Angular (5) or is this a viable option for writing code in AngularJS?

You will not have a good time building Angular 1 app and migrating it to Angular 5. If you think you need to end at Angular 5, start at Angular 5.

> Will components and one-way data flow speed up angularJS apps and solve the 2-way data binding (watchers) issues etc.?

Switching from AngularJs to VueJs is way easier than switching to Angular2345. You don’t have to learn TypeScript, you don’t have to rethink the whole framework completely and to be honest, Vue is extremely enjoyable to work with. You’re actually still coding with JavaScript
I see Angular like a product in decline, and I believe you can see the trend happening statistically. TypeScript is complete nonsense (in my opinion). Some developers of other oriented languages wanted to bring the specificities of their language to JavaScript instead of embracing it, thinking their way was a superior one. They did that to Php, making it look like a huge mess, plugging all nonsense coming from other languages an now people turn to... NodeJs. Another enjoyable tools to develop with (given that you’re going to use ES5, ES6, NPM, Express, etc).

It makes performing things like forEach loops or array manipulation easier. I used it in static one-page websites who's content was not driven by any type of back-end API.

Angular (And other similar frameworks) is a completely different solution. As the article states, it provides a very simple and efficient means of combining back-end data with front-end logic. Angular should not be used for basic DOM manipulation or performing a forEach loop or some kind of array manipulation.

A good example of this was when I needed to add cascading drop-downs to a SharePoint list. The library I used required jQuery as a dependency and was as simple as dropping a few files into place and including them in the creation form with 10 lines of JS. Angular cannot do that.

jQuery is still relevant and useful by itself and when combined with other projects and keeps a gap filled (When a project is not really on the scale that angular is needed).

All of your solutions are legitimate. Scope sharing is the most practical but limit reusability. In my team we use explicit binding chains through the components architecture, it's tedious but we can easily share them abd it's easier to debug and formalize with the components lifecycle. Another solution is indeed sharing a service but what I find most useful is to use a pub-sub pattern. It can be superfluous since bindings achieve the same thing but sometimes it's just easier.

I guess that makes me a lousy corporate shill :-) ).

There is a struggle for students around ""which version of AngularJS, which generation of AngularJS approach?"". We've updated our curriculum to what we think is a reasonably ideal and mature point to pick up AngularJS 1.x today. A relatively modern approach to AngularJS. 1.6. Components, ES2015 classes, etc.

The problem is...  most students are planning to join some existing project that has been around a while, a project which probably does not use AngularJS in the exact way we show in class. They probably use some different point release, they do some things in an older way, etc. So even though I think we do a quite good job teaching it, nonetheless depending on local practices where a student works, sometimes they need to do quite a bit of research afterward to understand the nuances between the modern approach we taught, versus the practices in use on a older, large system.

(We do a lot of corporate training...  where of course it is easier to adjust things to talk about older practices or whatever. But this doesn't help an individual like the OP at all, and nowadays the great bulk of teams learning Angular are learning version 5, not version 1.x!)

axolotlotoloxa,"I don't think I've ever encountered an ""Enterprise Framework"" I enjoy working with regardless of language / stack - .NET, Java, JavaScript - doesn't matter.  Angular is an Enterprise Framework. 

More often than not - they get in the way, and you end up solving framework problems, not business problems. 

They at times can make the complex simple, but make simple very complex. Most needs, are more simple than you think - and probably don't justify the complexity that the framework brings along with it. Angular is an Enterprise Framework - both in the good, and bad connotations of ""Enterprise Framework"" 

If your complex does not fit within their pattern - the complex becomes a mess, as you end up fighting with the tool instead of working with it. 

It can still the right tool for some jobs/applications. I'll work with it if I need to, but if given a say/influence over the choice of framework - the scenarios of which Angular comes out on top is getting smaller and smaller, and the factors of which I'd say yes to Angular as a whole lot of ""it depends...."" attached. 

It has its place - it's not going away, and for some teams / environments - it is the right choice. 

But blindly buying into ""it's enterprise ready"" - and assuming that you can magically turn a team of old-school / back end devs that know .NET/MVC or Java/Spring into front-end/full-stack devs within a week just because the syntax looks close enough is highly misguided.

If anything - it's detrimental. When trying to make the transition - it doesn't encourage the ""novice mindset"" enough. Mental models / assumptions that carry over from say C#/Java - look close enough to TypeScript/Angular - that you don't fall back to re-learn base level assumptions, and that ends up burning you. 

The async nature of JavaScript still messes people up - and the struggle / hacks / escape hatches that people try to do to make async act like sync code - and at times ends up working by accident and by not intent is well... *sigh*

Or the concept of functions being first class citizens - functions can take functions as arguments, and/or return functions. You can get the same results that you would rely on convoluted OOP structure where you get a gorilla holding a banana for an error logger, or a too auto-magical DI system (dependency inversion = yes, much yes, dependency injection frameworks - it depends).

Toss in the differences between classical inheritance vs prototype inheritance, the context of 'this' still being unclear:

     class SomeClass {
         someMethod() { }
         anotherMethod = () => { }
     } 

ES6 and fat-arrows helped a lot with the 'this' problem - but then also added Classes - but class methods can still lead to 'this' problems. Yes, this is a bit of a gripe about ES6 in general - but when TypeScript looks close enough to C#/Java - and how class-centric Angular is - that lots of people don't grok the difference between `someMethod() { }` and `anotherMethod = () => { }`. When that leads to a bug - tends to result in a pile-on of shitty-band aid code - instead of stepping back to consider ""Hey, maybe I just need to understand JavaScript a bit better"" - and solve the root of the problem, not add another bandaid to the 50 layers on top. 

Note: Some of this is not due to Angular itself - but the perception of it, without doing due diligence before adopting it.

I can be/am very productive with it (although at times it feels like despite it, not because of it) - and there are some situations where I think it is the right choice - but it's not the ""easy yes"" people seem to think it is.

For example, if I'm building a simple website with a couple of forms, I can pull in AngularJS from a CDN and make use of the FormController, as well as the HTTP Ajax functionality, with barely any Javascript. Brotli compressed, this comes down at 57KB, and you don't need jQuery.

jQuery comes down at 31KB with Brotli, but you definitely need to write more Javascript to get the same sort of form validation, with AngularJS you can just decorate your markup with attributes. Even building forms in React [just seems like more work.](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

You just can't do this with Angular2+ (pull it in from a CDN and get things working, with barely any code), you need to use the CLI and everything is just heavier.

I'm in the middle of such an effort myself. We are a team of seasoned JavaScript/AngularJS developers who have been brought in to repair a large Ng -> Ng2 conversion after the previous dude ran away screaming (he may have been onto something).

the framework has moved far too fast through releases, without giving enough time for the Ng masters to drip down knowledge to me on the bottom rung. You might find some good postings on the internet for Angular2, not knowing that the API being discussed has already been deprecated and removed in Angular4+. Knowing AngularJS is actually a hindrance, because you approach every component with ""here's how I'd do it in AngularJS""..

I want to address some of your bullet points

* I believe almost all resources use typescript
* I guess most new projects use webpack or the CLI which I believe you can eject from to get the webpack config
* State management depends on what you/the company uses (if not just the native stuff), but for me the react state management concepts also work very well with Angular. Otherwise looking into services, dependency injection, change detection and observables should be a good way to get up to speed.
* I don't think ignoring decorators is a good strategy, does the company use decorators? I am pretty sure that almost all resources use them because they are the standard. What are your concerns with them? They are basically just config objects that describe the component and marks stuff for the framework. 

I use both (currently more react) and the basic structures of my projects look very similar. Dumb vs smart components (or however you want to call them) can still be applied, props are very similar with the difference that event handlers are defined and passed differently. The thing that currently lets me favour react over angular is that angular is less flexible. Everything has to fit into its module system, which for example makes dynamic component creation (e.g. styled-components) a lot harder. ",1517330819.0

> All AngularJS modules.js, directive.js, controllers.js services.js and views.js live inside a PostgreSQL database instead of a static directory. 

Yikes! How are you going to use standard tools like `grep`, your favorite IDE, or even `git`? What are you doing to keep track of revisions of that source? Can I use a tool like `kdiff3` or my favorite merge tool to review and merge different versions of the same file when two programmers have changed the same file? The list of what you can do on the file system (but what goes away when you store code in a DB) is very long. One good rule of thumb when evaluating ideas like this is to ask if another programmer could have thought of and tried this idea before. Surely someone has tried putting code in a DB before? Both have been around for decades.

The most likely reason you don't find it in the wild is *not* because no one thought of it already. Most likely it's because there are problems with that solution. I'm not saying don't be afraid to *experiment* and maybe you will even discover a new way of doing things. But the key word is *experiment*. If you wanted to store code in the DB, just for example, it should be a *side project* of its own and you should be getting other programmers involved in that experiment to test it against a wide variety of scenarios to see if the idea has any merit at all.

I'm not even going to comment on most of your other choices, some of which are almost as bizarre. Only to say that the more you deviate from the standard way of writing an app, the more of a learning curve it is for other devs. For each of the decisions you've made, I would ask yourself what problem it solves and then seek out answers on how other people are already solving that problem. I haven't seen anything particular to your situation that would lead me to the architecture you've described.

>  I'm not a fan of using JavaScript in the backend and prefer something object oriented.

While choosing Python over JavaScript is not something I want to get into a religious war about here, the reason you gave is not very strong. JavaScript is an object-based language, and prototypical inheritance can often be more powerful and flexible than class-based inheritance.

EricTboneJackson,"> Angular is not simple at all.

Totally disagree. Angular 2 is very simple. You have HTML templates bound to Javascript objects. Most of it is incredibly straightfoward.

    @Component({
        selector: 'greeter',
        template: '<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>',
    })
    class Greeter {
        name = ""World"";
    }

This creates a component which you can instantiate by using the tag <greeter> which displays ""Hello World"". You could parameterize the name by simply flagging the name property as an Input with decorator:

    @Component({
        selector: 'greeter',
        template: '<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>',
    })
    class Greeter {
        @Input() name = ""World"";
    }

Now you can write something like `<greeter name='Bob'>` in your HTML. What if you want to click on the the greeter object and show a popup? Just create a click binding:

    @Component({
        selector: 'greeter',
        template: '<h1 (click)=""greet()"">Hello {{name}}</h1>',
    })
    class Greeter {
        @Input() name = ""World"";

        greet() {
            alert(`How's it going, ${this.name}!`);
        }
    }

So on and so forth. Ordinary Javascript classes bound to templates in a straightforward, readable way.

,"I’m not really sure how to answer this because Angular development is front end web development. You’re simply using a framework rather than plain JavaScript. I suppose depending on what work you did as a front end web developer that Angular could imply more of a “web app” development instead of simple websites (that’s how I’m interpreting your comment about working on “websites”). That’s probably the closest I can come to a distinction. That being said, my first job title with my current company was Front End Developer even though I worked in Angular building an app. Angular development still involves writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Because it’s usually more of an app than a simple website, there is often work with APIs (both internal and usually for external applications such as AWS or analytics) and databases. If you’re familiar with working with them and consuming them on the front end, then you should be fine. My basic answer though is that if you feel comfortable with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then all you need to do is learn the specifics of the Angular framework and you’ll be totally fine.",1515904173.0

So first of all, the `+` means addition when dealing with numbers, and concatenation when dealing with strings:

    ""one"" + ""two""; // evaluates to ""onetwo""
    ""1"" + ""2""; // evaluates to ""12""
    1 + 2; // evaluates to 3

So there's mystery one. The other thing is type coercion. If you try to add a number and a string, the interpreter has to guess if you meant to add numbers or concatenate strings, and will convert your values depending upon its best guess. And it will guess you meant to add right up until it encounters a `string`, and will then proceed to concatenate:

    5 + 5 + ""5""; // 105
    ""5"" + 5 + 5; // 555


So when you sum your numbers, things get screwy:

    5 + 5 + """" + """" + """"; // evaluates to 10
    """" + """" + """" + 5 + 5; // evaluates to ""55""

What you need to do is keep your types straight. Make sure your `number`s are always `number`s, and it'll work out as you intend.

akujinhikari,"So here's the thing. Angular is Javascript, which is a front-end language. Now, you could build a whole site with just Angular and no back end, but that's a bad idea. For instance, you could have users.js which is just a json file like so:

    Users: {
      user1: {
        ""name"" : ""Bruce"",
        ""password"" : ""SupermanSucks"",
        ""permissions"" : ""admin""

        ""name"" : ""Clark"",
        ""password"" : ""ILoveLois"",
        ""permissions"" : ""user""
      }
    }

Then every time someone logs in, Angular checks the user.js for the user and logs in accordingly. This is a terrible idea, because Javascript is 100% viewable. Anyone can see this information, and that's very, very bad. That's why people use api's to handle sensitive data... or really any data. In order to use Angular, you'd typically want a RESTful API and a database, and Angular can ""ask"" for that information when needed, and then only the pertinent information is sent and received. Then Angular can take that data and do what you want with it. For instance, now that Bruce is logged in, he has access to the ""Admin"" page, but when Clark logs in, he doesn't have access. Angular can do that kind of logic (although the api should also have a failsafe from someone bypassing the use of a browser). You build the back end as an information machine, and Angular as a dispenser of information that has been deemed to be viewed by the public.",1513967302.0
foszterface,"I haven't used angular in a year or so, so take this with the requisite grain of salt. I think angular's strength is in data binding and injection: sort of a bridge between the backend and the nearly static html at the front.

oowowaee,"So for example the ""what to show when a user logs in"" really depends on the data.  You could have Angular only display the admin edit controls for admin users, but what if I bypass your interface?  If you're not also checking permissions and authorization on the server side, what's preventing me from updating/viewing data you're filtering out with Angular?

Any front end framework is just consuming and displaying an interface for interactions with the server (or the original data source).  If you want to persist data to a server, you will obviously  need a backend, and that backend also needs to be in control of who and how data is being accessed.

Edit for explicitness:
If you're serving Angular data from a REST API, if you are the owner of that API, you need a backend.

You also need something to serve your site, but that could be pretty minimal, so I am ignoring that.

However, you can directly reference the model if you put it on a named controller. Further, you can attach a reference to the model onto the controller to still use 'this'. If it is a component or directive, you should be passing a reference in the markup if you want it to be reusable.

I can try to help more if you can give us a jsfiddle/codepen/whatever.

,"I can't seem to see your examples on mobile, but I will try to answer, and hopefully it is not irrelevant. To get the inputs working on a structural directive, you are going to want to prefix the variable name with the directive selector. So if you have a structural directive with the selector ""myAwesomeDirective"", change this:

    @Input()
    myStuff;

To this:

    @Input()
    myAwesomeDirectiveMyStuff;

Then, you have to reference the variables online to use them by putting an asterisk before the selector, then putting the default input as the first element in the binding, then a semicolon separated list of the input names WITHOUT the selector name in front of them, and with no equals:

    <div *myAwesomeDirective=""foo; myStuff bar""></div>

richcsmith,"The way you are invoking your buttonPress function is calling it at runtime instead of when the button is actually clicked. In your case, the reason you’re seeing the results you are when the page loads is because the function is being invoked at runtime instead of only being invoked as the result of a click. Even though you’re passing `buttonClick()` to `ng-click`, because you’re calling the function, it will be invoked when the controller is instantiated—when the page loads.

If you want to defer the function call to when the button is clicked, you can either wrap it in an anonymous function or bind the function arguments to the function you would like to call. More reading on the function bind method here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind

`ng-click=“buttonPress.bind(null, arg1, arg2, ...args)”`

zmasta94,"On every call to the API you need to check if the token the browser has is expired. If it's not, then get the Auth code and add it to the header. If it is expired, you need to request a refreshed token and then use the Auth Code in the token you get back to make a request to the API.

zombarista,"I see a lot of the same reasons here that I share.

We use Angular 1.5.x and we are using TypeScript to improve our productivity and accuracy.

Our code base is a few megabytes of code that was built hastily by the cheapest consultants my company could find... I was brought in to help reign in the complexity.  AngularJS works, and if something better had existed at the time it was chosen, we would have went with it.

Our application's quality is slowly improving, and we've extracted business logic to a form that we would be able to move to another framework eventually (the business logic has been built as a separate TypeScript SDK).

We have a hard time getting any maintenance build time from our business, who ultimately pushes this application forward.

So--lots of reasons.  Ultimately, we were early adopters, and we have to sleep in the bed we've made.",1512792540.0

When you change routes, the list controller is destroyed and the objects on its scope are no longer attached to anything. When the detail controller is created, it pulls down the studies from your data source which is the same as before: it doesn’t have the fourth study.

The solution is to actually update data.json when you add a new study. Then it will show up in the details controller. ",1512186430.0
