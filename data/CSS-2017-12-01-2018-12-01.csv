*shudders*




I had a fiddle around in dev tools, but I'm not sure what's going on. I suspect the grid system isn't playing well in IE11.




Edit: Sorry I misunderstood what you were using, I'll have another look.



The short answer is that IE11 only has partial support for CSS Grid. [See here](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid) 


You can try prefixing the syntax with -ms- but even then I believe it uses an older version of grid which may be unpredictable.



The reason you can't see your footer links is because the .content div is set to min-height: 100%. The parent div is taking up the entire viewport height with height: 100%, therefore the footer is pushed out of view.


If you remove the min-height option you should find that the footer is in view again.",1543605296.0

dendaiagain,"I'm on mobile and the site you linked is broke as hell, but here's the usual typical way to do this (sorry for mobile typing in advance):

1) give you body a margin-top to push your content below the fixed nav:

Body { margin-top: 80px; }



2) make the nav the same height as your top, so it rests atop your content, with overflow visible so that the drop-down can break free:

Header { 

Position: fixed;

Top: 0;

Right: 0;

Left: 0;

Height: 80px;

Z-index: 5;

Overflow: visible;

}



3) next, create your nav inside the header, positioned where you need it's hamburger icon:

Header nav {

Position: absolute;

Height: 40px;

Width: 40px;

Top: 20px;

Bottom: 20px;

Right: 20px;

Overflow: visible;

}



4) there's lots of ways to do the next part. You could in theory put your hamburger in a before pseudo elements, but seeing events to a pseudo is hard, and it doesn't really respect accessibility.

I recommend something like:

<Header><nav><img><ul><\ul><\nav><\header>

Again, apologies on mobile keyboard.

In this way you can set the ul to break free from the confines of the nav. Because of that, the nav element is the size of the img. Because of that you can assign a click event to the nav to trigger your ul.

The overflow visible we set on the previous steps allows the ul to be seen outside of it's containing elements, nav and header.

All of that said, you can start manipulating your ul. It's free to do what you want, while semantically living in the nav and header.

If you want it to live off screen and take up the whole screen and slide in when active, do this:

Nav ul {

Position: fixed;

Display: block;

Z-index: 10;

Top: 80px;

Left: 0;

Right: 0;

Bottom: 0;

Overflow: scroll;

Transition: ease all .2s;

Transform: translatex(-100%);

}

Nav ul.active {

Transform: translatex(0);

}

On click assign active.

* Then a wrapper around the form items as a column container, with each form item (div containing label + input) being a row container.
* Then another row container for the buttons.

Luke-At-UCS,"LESS, SASS, SCSS, Stylus, and the like let you write clear, maintainable shorthand styles more efficiently. You reduce chances for things to go wrong when you have reusable variables on hand instead of trying to consistently use the same values for colors, breakpoint widths, padding, and font sizes, for example. You can easily ""scope"" certain selectors with nesting and avoid a boatload of duplication. You can break apart your single long monolithic stylesheet into easily parsed modules or components. There's lots of little things that make it easier to use over the long run.

Doing all this adds a build step - turning the preprocessed source code into plain old CSS - but that additional step becomes second nature *really* quickly. That build step can easily include additional things like linting, autoprefixing, and minification.

Even better, that build step can include more than just your styles, but you may also turn a bunch of markdown files into HTML fragments, stick those fragments into templates and saved minified HTML files, optimize and auto-crop images, transpile your newfangled javascript arrow functions so they work in older versions of IE (while also linting and minifying them), etc. One consistent command can do all that across completely different projects, even if the tasks themselves differ slightly for each.

Doing all that at build time makes your source code even easier to read and maintain without doing any of the grunt work and while removing the opportunity to forget or screw up a step. That's not to say that anyone has to do all of that! That's just an example of how it can be a good practice to learn.",1543438286.0

You'll then need to clear the float by putting overflow: hidden in the .post div. This is the old dirty way of doing it, but there's a new way with flexbox. Here's the flexbox example:  
http://jsfiddle.net/a5mof1yq/",1543137268.0
Zecuel,"I'm not entirely sure how editing a subreddit goes but, in CSS, the syntax goes like this:


    --selector-- {
        --value--;
        --value2--;
    }

Where the selector selects a HTML element, usually by class or ID. Anything betwee  the {}'s is considered a part of that selector. 

A selector which begins with a dot means it's referencing a class. For example if you had the selector '.header', it would affect every element which had the class of 'header'. An element like that could be something like this:

    <div class=""header"" />

Note that class selectors apply to ALL elements with that class.



A selector which begins with a hashtag means it's referencing a single element by it's ID. If you had '#header' as a selector, it will affect an element with the ID of 'header'.

For example, these two divs:

    <div />   // NOT affected
    <div id=""header"" /> // Affected


Then just look at your elements. For example a button could be:

    <button class=""button green primary""     id=""homeButton""/>


This button would have the CLASSES  'button', 'green' and 'primary'.

It would have an ID of 'homeButton'.",1543135623.0

You either need to remove the margin-top-30 class from the div, or change that margin-top value to zero. I don't suggest changing the CSS value to zero because lots of other stuff is going to be using that class, so if you can simply remove the class from the div then it'll work.",1542223840.0

NarcolepticSniper,"Sounds like you don’t need the header to be fixed at all. Just use overflow-y: scroll; in the second “body” div and let all the content movement happen within that.

You can wrap them both in a flex div, with display: flex; and flex-flow: column nowrap;, and use flex-grow: 1; on the body to allow the body to adapt to the remaining page height based on whatever the height of the header is at any given point. 

Add -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; to the body to ensure it has momentum scrolling on mobile devices. 

I generally only use position: fixed; if the layout context can change independently of the behavior I’m needing from a special element. If your layout flow never changes, might as well do your best to have a predictable context from top to bottom. Makes things easier down the road. Avoid position: absolute; whenever possible (with the advent of flex, there really is no advantage anymore).

superjaberwocky,"You could give a height to the <header>, such as 10vh and then make the showcase div the difference, 90vh in this case. 

Now, that's not necessarily going to work at different screen sizes, because the amount of content in your header will be taller than 10vh at narrower widths, so you could also set a range of heights. 

`header {min-height:10vh; max-height: 20vh}`

`.showcase {min-height: 80vh; max-height: 90vh}`

Still, this will not always account for all the content at every single screen size and may break if you make future changes to the menu.

My solution: Put the header content and showcase content into a single containing div that is set to 100vh and full width. THEN, use flexbox on that container to apportion the vertical space between those two elements. [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

cmdq,"Hey there. A pinch-zoom/pan interaction like you're describing is usually something fairly complicated, because there is no way (yet?) to tell a browser ""Hey, I want to make this content zoomable"".

To answer your question: this is 'doable via css' insofar that css will be involved in your solution, but not by itself. CSS is solely used for styling elements; interactive stuff like handling a user gesture (and applying the right css to an element) will be done by JavaScript.

Now, I'm not sure whether you've meddled with JS before, but having had a brief look at Silex, it's at least possible to add your own JS code to your project. This is what you'll have to do.

There's a big, popular JS project out there called jQuery - it basically helps you access and manipulate page elements. jQuery can be extended by plugins (of which there are gazillions) which usually bring in special functionality like a zoomable/pannable image section for example.

Here's one of those plugins that seems like it could do the job: [https://github.com/waynegm/imgViewer](https://github.com/waynegm/imgViewer/blob/master/plugindocs/usage.md)

If you simply set left:0; on the fixed position nav element that will solve the issue.

Note that this only works because your parent element does not have display:relative; or display:absolute; on it. This works because the closest positioned parent is the body element.

user9713,"Hey everyone, beginner here. I'm hoping you can review my code and provide feedback.

**Since this is a CSS sub, I'll only ask for review on the following:**

- **CSS structure:** would you say it's efficient in terms of keeping it DRY or even naming convention? Should I use classes? What would you recommend/change?
- **Responsiveness pt1:** how would you rate the responsiveness and should I change anything?
- **Responsiveness pt2:** The close button isn't very responsive on smaller resolutions; it loses it's alignment. Is there a way to fix it? Maybe media queries, but the modal container has a min/max width along with a width of 50% (<- i.e., it'll change depending on screen width)
- **Slightly OT**, but do you see any design issues, like whitespacing, typography (in terms of weight/size/etc), contrast, colors, etc? Or perhaps even the shape/location of any of the elements (I have doubts about the location of the close button).

**Note:** I used the letter ""X"" for the close button and system fonts just for the sake of convenience. Please don't think I'd ever use that in real life. :P

-----

I also have other questions, but I feel they're OT. Either way, I'll leave them here so I can copy + paste in a more appropriate sub tomorrow:

- HTML structure: is it efficient and well-designed (i.e., no unnecessary elements / containers)?
- JS: I wanted for the user to be able to close the modal by clicking outside of it, but it seems that if I enable 'click' event handler on the black transparent BG, clicking on the close button fires off the event twice, so nothing changes. If this isn't clear, please just go to the JS part and uncomment the two lines.

- Floats came first
- Flexbox came afterwards

This is a great guide for beginners on learning floats & flexbox (it's on /r/HTML's stickied thread). It doesn't have a section for Grid, but there are other tutorials on YouTube. https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/

For Grid, I used this YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6CBKf8K_Ac

**Make sure you have your code editor open and follow along with what they do**

Also, have these references open when learning flexbox + grid as you may find it tough to remember which properties do what and which apply to the parent and which apply to the child:

- [Flexbox reference](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- [Grid reference](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

**Edit:**

I strongly suggest using Firefox when learning Grid. It has support for Grids that will show you the tracks+grid names and the overall grid. This will help you out immensely when debugging why your grid isn't working as you'd expect.

Here's [a preview](https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground/css-grid/03-firefox-devtools/) of what you get with Firefox in terms of grid. Note: you don't necessarily need the developer version (although it *may* offer more features).",1540918712.0

If you found a solution, pocket that; it might not be ideal, but it worked for you and you can build upon what you took from that experience. You’ve played the song, now how can you play it better? 

As for your code. If you can use CSS3, look up flexbox. It’ll help maintain alignment & scaling across different devices with the right code. I would also align everything to the center, it’ll look a little cleaner than the bias to the left. Check out media queries too if anything gets wonky when viewing on smaller or larger browser sizes. Only write new code if it breaks!! See if you can get better results with fewer lines!! Don’t stress if you can’t. You can always come back. 

You should also look into separating your concerns for accessibility. You want your HTML to dictate what is readable, otherwise someone who is blind will only hear “Hobby. One. Five.” from their screen reader. If you’re unsure how to get a SR to say “gigabyte” or “5 dollars a month”, google something like “html screen reader label” and see what you find.

One of the problems I have (which I left a comment in the CSS) is that using `margin-top` on the `h5` element causes the entire outer div to shift down, instead of just the `h5` element.

One of the questions I have is if my HTML markup correct. I figured it'd be 1 outer-div with 3 inner divs, but I'm not 100% sure.

Another question is, if I'm using the proper CSS properties to manipulate the position of the elements.

WorseThanHipster,"TL;DR: If you don't want a lesson right now, as others have pointed out, giving the parent of all those lists `display: flex` will suffice, and as of the past couple years, probably the way most professionals would take.  But, if you like fundamentals, read on.

---

From back before css, web browsers had 2 primary 'kinds' of display properties elements could have, ""block"" and ""inline"".  ""Block"" elements define their own space and by default take up all the space they are afforded, usually by the parent or through css, whereas ""inline"" elements have no inherent size, but only take up the space required by it's children.  In fact, inline elements ***completely ignore*** `height` or `width` properties.  Block elements also force a newline which means that even if you restrict a div to a certain width, it will still force it's siblings to live below it, whereas inline elements do not.  Certain elements default to block display (div, article, section, p, ol, ul, and headings h1, h2, etc...), and other elements default to inline (span, a, i, b, strong, button, input, label, img, etc...).  

This display attribute can be modified through css using the `display` rule.  There is also a 3rd *common* type (there are many more you don't need to wory about) called ""inline-block"" which, as you probably guessed, is a hybrid of the two.  Like block elements, it DOES have it's own defined size, and you can specify it with `height` and `width`, but like an inline element it defaults to only taking up as much space as it's children need.  It also does not force a newline.  

**SO**, your *apparent* issue is that you are using headings, articles/sections/paragraphs(`<p>`), and ordered lists (`<ol>`), which are all block level.  Something like this?:

          <section>
            <h1>Title</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>item</li>
              <li>item</li>
              <li>item</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

So what you want to do is give the sections, or whatever element you are using to wrap each list, the rule `display: inline-block`.


If this doesn't help you would you paste a snippet of the HTML?  Not the whole page please, but enough to see the structure and *a couple of* items?",1540387692.0

Luke-At-UCS,"It can be good for teaching, as there's just one file to copy and paste if someone tries it out. I suspect that's the intention - to make everything immediately available to those watching the tutorial. It sidesteps the questions of ""Which file do I put this into again?"" and ""Why aren't my styles loading?"".

There's also a benefit to initial load time. Look up Critical Styles. The browser doesn't have to go fetch a potentially monolithic stylesheet to set up initial layout and type styles, for example. This can be taken to various extremes that get counter-productive very quickly, but is generally a sound idea. It works especially well for SPAs, which don't really care if someone has cached the external stylesheet because there's only ever one initial page load.

I once made a tiny game which consisted of a single http request - everything was inline and there were no external styles, scripts, or images. I used separate files to create it and combined and minified them with a build script, but it actually worked quite nicely and was a fun challenge.

Also you could have server-rendered CSS which can most conveniently be added in a `<style>` element as a part of rendering the page. Imagine a CMS-driven site where each page has its own primary color (perhaps selected by users for their profile or something). You could have your server render something like the following (pardon the php)...

    echo( '<style>main { --primary-color: #' .
      $primary_color_hex_code_in_php .
      '; } </style>' );

... and then have all your links set as `a { color: var(--primary-color); }`. Each page's primary content would get links set as the corresponding color as driven from the CMS, even if it's user-configurable and you have no way of ever setting up all the possible styles in advance.

As a rule of thumb, however, stick your styles in a stylesheet unless you have a good reason to do otherwise. That way the stylesheet is cached for every page load after the initial one.",1540388816.0
Roacheth,"It could affect accessibility - inline styles almost always override linked css - so if someone has a custom sheet set up for their specific disability or illness this could cause an issue.

Also, maintainability would be an issue.... having an external sheet linked means when you change the size of h1 it changes the base h1 size, having it inline means you need to change it on every page you have. The difference between updating one sheet vs potentially 10+ is a pain.

lamb_pudding,"So, it sounds like your main goal is for `.info` to not affect the vertical position of `.title` and preceding elements. What's happening right now is `.info` is inside of `.top.cf` which also contains `.my-slider`. Three routes you could go are:

- Make `.top` `position: relative` and then make `.info` `position: absolute`. When an element is position absolute it will not push it's parents bounding box out. Not a great fix, but would be quick and work. 

- Get rid of `<div class=""top cf"">`. Group everything in the left column in a new div (`.my-slider`, `.title`, ... all the way to `.text-wrapper`). Then group all the `<div class=""info"">` into a new div and place this div just after the other new div you created. Then you can make a layout where the two divs are placed next to each other. This method may be tricky for getting your mobile design how you want since the dom order changed.

- Use CSS grid. It's fairly well supported these days however it will require some learning to figure out. What's great about grid is you can create a grid structure without using a ton of wrapping `<div>`s. [This game](http://cssgridgarden.com/) was very helpful for me to learn CSS grid.

If you add `.b { background: red; }` .a and .b visually fade in at the same rate. As .a goes from transparent to red background, .b goes from opacity 0 to 1. Halfway through the transition, the backgrounds match at 50% transparent red.

Also, you don't need javascript for this. If you change `.a.hovered, .b.hovered` to `.a:hover, .a:hover + .b`, you should be able to drop the script entirely.",1540233254.0

This sets the width of the body to 1200px, and applies an automatic margin to both sides of the body. This creates the centre-align effect you see on r/MLB. e.g. If your screen width is 1400px, your browser will allocate 100px on the left, 1200px in the centre for your body, and 100px on the right.

Notice the preloaded stylesheet sets the box to a red colour, but the editable stylesheet has it set to yellow. It is overridden because inline stylesheets take precedence over external ones. Your users can type whatever else in there and it will also be applied.

The HTML on this can get real ugly because you have to have all the active/passive stuff at the same level. They can't be wrapped in different elements or anything.


But you could use:

    .passive:nth-of-type(5) ~ .result {

Where 5 items are required to trigger the condition.

It isn't really possible to do move SVGs around with CSS (Except for the outermost SVG tag), but you can do what you want easily enough by changing the width to ""100%"" for every element, then changing the radius of each circle to decrease by 5 for each circle.

The reason why it's not possible to move SVGs around with CSS is because by nature, SVGs work in a system very similar to ""position:absolute"", using coordinates to determine how the shapes should be drawn. If we tried to use CSS, we'd be overriding the coordinates that were used to build the shape in the first place.",1538726446.0

THIS_IS_NOT_SHITTY,"Just to clarify, it’s not “leftover space.”

It’s a block level `<p>` tag. So it’s displaying with `block` properties as a default (such as this elusive margin’ing the “leftover” space all the way to the right, because well... it’s a block, it wants to occupy the entire block).

So setting `margin-right: 0` is an override to an otherwise intrinsic property of an element that is `display: block` by default. But the block property is fighting your margin value (as far as an block-element is concerned), but obeys what you want to a degree and can’t ignore its *intrinsic* block-ness.

As an experiment, watch what happens when you set that element to `display: flex` or `display: inline-block `. Watch those margins *truly* obey your styles. 

This is important to understand because let’s say you had two columns of contact info in your sidebar, you’d run into re-flow issues on these elements without changing their `display` properties.

* change 'position: relative;' to  'position: absolute;' on #rectangle-one
* remove z-index from #rectangle-one
* change 'transform: translateX(30px);' to 'left: 30px;'

'position: absolute' on the element starts a new stacking context and you should not add z-index to this element.

a. Any text you put in CSS can't be translated into another language, if you're using a CMS like Wordpress or Drupal. (I imagine Google Translate would probably have a hard time with it too.)

b. Accessibility problems (Screen readers are likely to have a hard time properly reading it.)

c. SEO. Search engines aren't going to like(Or possibly even notice) text that you've placed into your CSS.

d. Separation of concerns. In general, CSS should ONLY be for style, not content. HTML shouldn't have any style. Breaking this rule will lead to more messy code. If you start adding text to your CSS, in about three months from now, somebody else working on the project is going to want to change your text, and they'll tear their hair out in frustration trying to find where the text is coming from.

Let as say I have a div with about 10 different attributes for the classes.

eg. 

    <div class=""classA classB classC classD .. classJ (for 10 attributes) or classP (for 15 attributes)>
       some content here
    </div>

In the background of the div, I would like classA to result in a glyph at character position (behind so it doesn't obscure the the text). classB would place a glyph at character position 2. The positions don't have to be character sized, they could be one/x of the width of the div, with x being the number of attributes, with classA's glyph at the beginning of the div, classB's glyph 1/10th into the div, C at 2/10th into the div etc. The graphics don't have to be glyphs, they could be coloured or patterned squares.

For example lets say it is possible to place multiple graphic elements in the div which occupy the whole div, Each glyph would be a transparent rectangle with the opaque part corresponding to the ordinal of the class, so classA would be represented by a graphic opaque at the 1st tenth with the remaning 9/10th transparent, classB would be opaque only at the 2nd tenth of the graphic, classJ would be opaque only at the last tenth. I don't how demanding or resource intensive such a system would be, nor do I know if its possible to place up to ten graphics elements which can only be seen because their opaque parts don't overlap.

A google query brought up this article, [Styling Elements With Glyphs, Sprites and Pseudo-Elements — Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/styling-elements-with-glyphs-sprites-and-pseudo-elements/) but I am not quite sure whether it is what I have in mind.",1537656727.0

Responsive design is about accommodating all screen sizes, including the middle ones. I don't know why you would focus on two views instead of the infinite number of them between them. It's simple enough to check all sizes by re-sizing your browser throughout the development process.

cauners,"It is also kinda possible to do [with svg-in-css](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zJeaBJ?editors=1100) and CSS variables. 

* Begin point has a pseudo element;
* This element has an SVG background, encoded in base64;
* SVG contains a single line that stretches from top left to bottom right;
* The pseudo elements width and height are defined by the position of the two points, so it forms a rectangle with its top left corner at begin point and bottom right at end point.

This also allows the points to be at different positions on the Y axis. 

However, this approach will fail if the end point is *before* the begin point on either X or Y axis (the height / width calculation would yield a negative value). Also, if the points are on the same place on the X or Y axis, the line will almost disappear, because the width / height calculation yields zero, so the background is not visible (this can, however, be mitigated to some extent by adding a min-height and min-width to the pseudo element).

Why do we? It’s a mix of reasons, but you’re right that framework developers used 12 columns because it was easier to do the math given the predominant window sizes. Since the framework isn’t being purpose built for a particular site, the developers are forced into writing something that’ll be as widely useable as possible... 12 columns happens to fit that description.

So using a framework has its trade-offs. On one hand, you are able to get very accustomed to the universal classes between projects so it’s easy(er?) to transition between sites and projects, everything is already built to a baseline so it can be faster, and good frameworks are fairly bullet-proof for cross-browser compatibility. The downside is just as you said; one-size-fits-all doesn’t really fit much well and everything can start looking similar with everybody sharing the same base structure.

This is part of why flex and CSS Grid are stirring up so much interest and excitement. Want five columns with 13px gutters? Done in ten seconds and a couple lines of CSS. As a bonus, each column can be coded to scale non-uniformly or not at all.

from a design point of reference, i think its weird that the analog sticks have shadows but everything else is flat.

you have an empty div that doesnt seem to do anything, the rails arnt being used.

I would separate the two joycons so you're not drawing them with the same element. you could simplify a lot of things by not using excessive befores and afters (not that its not neat to have lots of things happening from the same div, but buttons can be their own element)

namespace everything to the controller, use BEM. with additional context you might run into css scope conflicts from your home, select, body classes.

.joycon

.joycon--left

.joycon--right

.joycon__button--a

.joycon__button--b

.joycon__button--x

.joycon__button--y

etc

you have a .rail-l, .rail-r and r-bumper,l-bumper, i would order the object first, then have the modifier class second, se BEM.

""Oh! It looks like you need a single component that Bootstrap provides. Download the entire library to achieve your one objective"".

Instead, learn how that JavaScript works and roll your own! The accordion JavaScript isn't hard.

1. Load the page with the accordion content expanded and calculate the height on the expanded after everything's loaded.
2. Set the height to 0 on all the accordion elements.
3. Transition between 0 and the calculated height.

If so: look up [box-shadow.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)  

Now, CSS alone can get you the shadow, and you can set its color manually, but if you need to do that programmatically for images you haven’t seen before: 

- You’ll need to use a bit of Javascript to extract the dominant color from the image. There are tiny libraries like Colorify.js that can do this. 
- Then, once you’ve extracted that value, you can then apply the drop shadow dynamically with another bit of Javascript.

By setting the overflow to auto on the parent/wrapper div you give the default rule saying ""make sure that whatever is in this div, stays in this div"". and when you force the image to be 100% width of the div it stretches across all the way, this also makes the element responsive as well, because if the parent shrinks less than whatever you set the width to be, the image will resize accordingly.

I've added a [codepen](https://codepen.io/s31181/pen/zJPzmd) and commented the css rules.

Hope this helps!

Further, there is an emphasis on ""pure"" CSS, which I assume to mean it is independent of preprocessors. Titanium is a functional CSS framework, and the major benefit that people get from functional CSS is being able to build up components from highly specialized classes. This is of course possible without a preprocessor, but it shifts the work to the HTML where we'll be swapping out classes whenever we want to make a change instead of doing our composition in the CSS.

Try that? I think that was your problem, but if not please clarify. I recently had this same problem, if you are using a css pre-processor just make sure that you save the font to a variable before declaring another @font-face; that was another problem I had.

​

The font-weight and font-style are used when importing multiple styles of a font, ex.

`@font-face {`

`font-family: 'SAME NAME HERE';`

`src: url('fonts/FONTNAME-ITALIC.woff') format(woff);`

`src: url('fonts/FONTNAME-ITALIC.ttf') format(truetype);`

`font-weight: normal;`

`font-style: italic;`

`}`

`* {`

`font-family: FONT STACK`

`font-style: italic;`

I wanted to point out that the way you’ve handled your columns isn’t the best way to achieve this. The beauty of CSS grid is that there are special units that make it so you don’t have to use percents, specifically the fr unit https://alligator.io/css/css-grid-layout-fr-unit/

In the COLUMNS section, you’re calculating the column width based on the width of the design (1290px) with column width (54px). If you’re building a responsive website you should be avoiding fixed widths like that. All you really need to do is find the total number of columns “n” and set up your grid-template-columns as the total number of columns to span times n.
So you can greatly simplify your columns:

```
/* change this */
grid-template-columns: 4.06504065% 12.814556717% 18.81533101% 13.008130081% 2.322880372% 8.439798684% 8.594657375% 23.228803717% 8.713372048%;

`animation-direction: reverse;`

to the class/element you're adding your `animation` property to.

lamb_pudding,Regarding `margin: 20px 0;` I follow the school of thought that you should overwrite styles as little as possible. If the `margin-left` and `margin-right` were already `0px` before your styles were applied I would use `margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;` over `margin: 20px 0;`. Although it is an extra line of code you are not overwriting the default value of `0px` with a more specific declaration of `0px`.,1534449935.0
rbra,"The browser will read **margin:20px;** as **margin:20px 20px 20px 20px;**
It sets the margin of Top, Right, Bottom and Left.

And the browser will read **margin:20px 0;** as **margin:20px 0 20px 0;**

What you're seeing is just shorthand ways to handle it.  **Margin:20px;** is the same as typing out **Margin:20px 20px 20px 20px;**",1534456784.0
mebrowsingreddit,"As others have rightly pointed out, with **margin: 20px 0;** you're essentially doing the following:

    margin-top: 20px;
    margin-right: 0;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    margin-left: 0;

whereas **margin: 20px;** is:

    margin-top: 20px;
    margin-right: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    margin-left: 20px;

The margin value applies to spacing **outside** the box. As the H1 is **inside** the box, any ""*coded margin*"" it has will have no effect on the box's margin. It's not cumulative.

A margin value of 20px is the same as saying ""I want to space this box 20px away"" from the thing next to it, be that another element, it's own container (as in your example), or the edge of the page.

The box can't push its parent container out away from itself, so instead, it reduces its size to conform to the margin value of 20px, which is why the box with **margin: 20px;** is smaller than the box with **margin: 20px 0;**.

The value of 0 is unchangeable, regardless of unit (i.e. %, px, rem, em, etc.) 0 is 0.

Giving a margin a value of 0 is the same as saying ""I don't want a margin here"".

In the case of **margin: 20px 0;**, as you see above, you're saying ""I don't want a margin-left or a margin-right."" Left and right can be as wide as the parent container.

programmingpadawan,"Have you ever tried your hand at hard coding in animations yourself?  CSS3 can do some pretty nifty stuff.

If you wanted to go that route both of your problems could be pretty easily solved.  You can add 2+ different animations to the same Element, and just as well, you can set timers and delays on each animation.  So in your first example, you could have one animation to fade in (taking 1s, for ex), and then another to fade out with a starting delay of 1s/2s/however long you want it to wait.  Apply that same logic to your second problem - literally use the same animation on each of your h2/spans, but just set the timing delay on each element to start .5s/1s/2s/whatever after the element before it.",1534427808.0
cauners,"There are multiple ways to approach the first problem.    

1. Use javascript and setTimeout to simply toggle the classes. I'd say this is not a very good solution for obvious reasons.
2. Write your own keyframe animation that does both things. It's actually very easy to do. Just spend a few minutes to [read through the docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations).
3. [Use another element that encloses the h1 and add the other animation class to that.](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ajeVOv) As mentioned in the [animate.css docs](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css), this library offers *delay-x* classes to set animation delays. So there would be two nested elements, which is not optimal, but that way you could avoid adding more CSS or javascript. 

As for the second problem, you could just use the delay classes for each element or, if the intervals are too long, dig in the library and write your own.",1534518047.0

beaniemonk,"I've been out of UX for a while, but when I was doing it, I did spend some time reading about and trying out the various color systems. HSL has always been my favorite. When you're starting at one color and trying to get to another, it's easily the most intuitive way to get there.

But if I recall correctly, one weakness of HSL is that it doesn't account for human perception. In other words, 100% yellow looks brighter than 100% green, which looks brighter than 100% blue.

So when you're creating complimentary colors in HSL by adjusting the Hue only, you'll tend to end up with hues that have different brightness relative to each other and need to be tweaked until they look consistent to your eye.

Anyway, I'd definitely recommend checking out the LCH color system, just to try it out. It's based on the LAB color system, which tries to account for how the human eye perceives color via complicated crazy math. LCH is to LAB what HSL is to RGB, so it's just as intuitive but gives you really consistent results when you adjust hues (at the expense of a smaller gamut).

CSS support is way off in the distant horizon, but there should be SASS/LESS support. I use PostCSS at work, and there's LCH() support via postcss-preset-env.

nibbiesan,"You have a 5px padding applying to every element on your page. (with the \* selector; that targets everything) As far as centering that in the middle, I would suggest learning about flex box. It'll make life easier as floats are really out dated and you shouldn't use them. IMO. You can learn the basics of flexbox in about 20 minutes with a quick search on YouTube.  Also take the 1em font size off of the body, and use font-size: 10px or 62.5% and then write all of your measurements in rems. This will set the root font size to 10px which = 1rem. So to get 20px you would do 2rem etc.

If your burger is strictly an element of your header and you don't want to split it out into its own file, `header__burger header__burger--active` isn't terrible; conversely, if you need to declare that your `burger` is a part of `header` (you have multiple burgers), I'd do `burger burger--off header__burger`.

I can think of three solutions:

1. [Flexbox](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox) or [Grid](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid): Modern CSS layout tools, though there are compatibility issues with IE.  Older versions of IE (9 and prior) would probably fall back to a less attractive layout, though you could create a fallback that uses floats for older versions of IE.  Grid also isn't supported by Opera Mini, if that's important to you.

lauraleeflores,"This is going to be a big job. Off the top of my head, you have two things you want to think about: CSS naming and stylesheet organization. 

CSS Naming is referring to how to name things in CSS (i.e. BEM, ITCSS, SMACSS).  The 2018 Front End Developer survey shows the most popular naming schemes: [https://ashleynolan.co.uk/blog/frontend-tooling-survey-2018-results#css-methodologies](https://ashleynolan.co.uk/blog/frontend-tooling-survey-2018-results#css-methodologies)  The two I would probably look at first at are BEM and CSS-in-JS.

The second thing you want to think about is stylesheet organization. Two huge stylesheets are going to be impossible to keep organized and maintained. I wrote an article about how to organize your stylesheets for large projects: [https://lauraleeflores.com/blog/how-to-organize-your-css-files](https://lauraleeflores.com/blog/how-to-organize-your-css-files) for exactly a situation like yours.

dshafik,"This isn't how emojis, Unicode, or fonts work.

Let me try to explain simply. Unicode is a set of standards that are basically a massive table that just links sequences of bytes to mean specific characters. These standards are things like UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, each of which uses different amounts of bytes for characters and different tables mapping bytes to characters.

Prior to Unicode, each language had its own table, and they would overlap, causing mayhem. This is why you specify the content encoding, to say which table you're using. Unicode supports ""all"" languages… sort of. Depending on which UTF version you pick, they may support more or less characters. Typically, however UTF-8 supports the most common ones while using the least amount of bytes/memory.

Then, you have BMP, or the Basic Multilingual Plane. Essentially all written languages are here. This is the first N rows of the table, and everything outside of that is considered outside the BMP - many fonts and tools only support the BMP. Emoji fall outside the BMP.

Now, on to fonts. Fonts are basically another giant table, this time mapping bytes to glyphs (letters, numbers, punctuation, and other characters, such as emoji). So, to render text, you specify the bytes from one of the Unicode tables for the character you want, and then you use those bytes to pick the glyphs from the font table and render it.

Emoji are just a set range of bytes in the Unicode table, rendered with a specific font. Now, the thing is that OSes and apps will render the BMP in one font and the emoji range in a special ""emoji"" font automatically — as far as I know, no other range in the Unicode standards is handled this way, it's a special thing just for emojis. This font is supplied by the OS or app, and this is why it's different platform to platform.

You can in theory specify/load a certain font for emoji and then add a span around each emoji byte sequence and apply that font, but you can't do the magic ""apply this font to these bytes"" that OSes and apps do.

All this to say: your experience is emoji working as intended. You need to use an image, preferably an SVG. There are libraries that will automatically replace emoji bytes with images. Which is what Twitter does on the web, for example.",1533125553.0

hlve,"> What are the best practices to follow when starting a new project without Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is great for small marketing websites, but for web applications (especially something large), you should be rolling your own. 

Remember: within a team, typically developers develop, whole designers design. I always suggest working with a design firm to help put together styling guidelines. They can assist in creating the look and feel for views, widgets, and common elements.


> Are there any specific skeletal/basic frameworks that you use?

Any popular 960 grid, and the typical reset.css to standardize your base stying across operating systems and browsers. Beyond that, you should be crafting everything by scratch. Otherwise, it’ll just be another bootstrap variant.


> Do you rewrite CSS (for buttons, grids, cards, etc) every time for every new project?

I normally use a grid that I’m familiar with, but for everything else, re-write manually for each project.


> What methods do you use to deal with repetitive components?

Across projects, there aren’t really repetitive components that are styled even remotely similar. If they are, they haven’t really been branded. 

I generally stick with creating a standard, familiar file structure (separating global styling for forms, buttons, base, then styling per component). 
 

> Is it even viable to start a fairly large project without frameworks?

Most do. UI Frameworks are great for foundation work on marketing websites. They don’t typically scale or look all that professional on large scale web applications. You’ll find yourself constantly modifying the frameworks default styling, and at the end of the day, it won’t look all that unique.

Do what you’re most comfortable with. Just my 2¢ from years of client-side development, with heavy focus on UI/UX. ",1533016438.0
decavolt,"1. Roll your own.
2. No. Roll your own.
3. No, but I do use my own unstyled boilerplate that just needs things like colors and sizing.
4. Absolutely.

**Don't over-complicate things.** You don't need a a big grid framework or Bootstrap or piles of kitchen-sink CSS when starting a new project, *especially* if you're working from a fleshed out design. You'll be amazed at how fast and simplified things can be if you only write what you need. It's incredible to me how so many designers/developers think they can't start a project without these giant CSS frameworks full of junk they don't need and will never use. You'll find that you've often spent more time trying to bend the framework into your design than you would have if you just rolled your own CSS from the start.

All you need it a simple boilerplate CSS file that has things like your preferred CSS reset, stubs for the most basic layout components, and some simple media queries.",1533046487.0

CaitForce,"Sorry for formatting, on mobile.

If you were to start a large project without a framework then you'd waste a lot of time custom styling everything. 

The way I get around it (I use grid css predominantly but I dont care about IE/Opera)  is that I use reset/normalize then create a widgets scss file, with all the basic stuff every project needs (buttons, forms, cards, etc) which like bootstrap works with variables to define colours and other attributes.

I then use this on every project as a basis for my sites. With grid being so simple, quick to code, and responsive, I use it for the general layout on every page and is custom coded,  a page generally takes me 10/15 minutes to create at all screen sizes (obviously not complex ones with flashy UIs)

1: There are many rules to make things work ;D

2: Yes, when you said svg:hover that was basically the whole screen, so I added an 'overlay' then sized & positioned it over what you wanted to hover for it to open. Like anything absolutely positioned you might have to fudge with these values to make it work more accurately in wherever you want this to be.

3:  The shop window and doors were using the same class, that class what setting the color of the polygons which is why they were both moving, you can see i was more specific and used the id's for exactly what you wanted. Id's cannot be used twice in the html so you cant have that same issue.

4: Anything is possible if you keep trying, This was actually fun for me because i got to play with some 3D transforms, and in turn that helps me learn them better.

And finally if you want them to look like they are sliding 'behind the wall' then you will have to add some more overlays OR change the order and values of polygons and g tags within the svg itself so the doors come before the wall in the html, that will act as the layering it needs.

However, older versions of IE are still a thing and _sometimes_ you may want to be able to support them. This is where, unfortunately, float layouts become needed again because older versions of IE don't know flex or grids.

`;
const Paragraph = styled.p`
  font-size: 1.1em;

Also we don't bother designing for screens less then 320px wide.

- You're doing great, already on good tracks: you have HTML and CSS under your belt. Kudos!

- Your next logical step would be learining a CSS preprocessor OR javascript, whatever thing you find more interesting.

- A preprocessor is very much helpful, especially in big projects. In small projects it might be overkill. It will help in structuring the code better and avoiding repetition. You SHOULD learn to use them, especially if you want to continue your web-dev career.

- Don't bite more than you can chew! Start easy with Sass (or whatever you choose), or maybe JS if you don't thing you need a preprocessor right now.

- Forget about Gulp or Webpack (for now). They're great tools but they solve problems you don't have yet. They are going to be totally overkill for your needs and their complexity might curb your entusiasm.

Questions to ask before making a decision

* what browsers do I need to support? 
* how will this code be used?
* who is working on my team?

If you are writing code for < IE Edge you will probably want to use a pre/post-processor to handle (at the very least) autoprefixing

If you are doing a small one-off project, you probably don't need anymore than CSS and you're going to waste time trying to get you're build tools setup. If you are building a larger tool or code which may be required to scale, use PostCSS with Gulp and/or Webpack.  I prefer PostCSS over SASS or LESS because it's modular. Each feature on-top of pure CSS is clearly defined in the postcss.config which makes it much easier to refactor later. If you like using SASS style syntax, use it. If you prefer to use w3c css standards with extra features, you can do that too.

Also, always consider who will be using your code later. Are you building this for a team? If so, you would be wise to consider you're team's coding experience and what they are most comfortable with. If you are writing this for yourself, consider what you would like to see/use in a few months.

Advantages to CSS

* You know when you've made it to complicated (because you can't read it anymore)
* no compiling required
* Becoming a master at the basics makes you a better programmer

Advantages to Pre/Post-processors

* Helps you manage complicated code
* Let's you write modules that can be used in multiple projects (this can also be done with css but it's harder)
* Gives you access to future-spec CSS (like cross-browser variables)",1531929185.0

jotted,"[SVG `polygon`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/points):

>The points attribute defines a list of points. Each point is defined by a pair of number representing a X and a Y coordinate in the user coordinate system. If the attribute contain an odd number of coordinate, the last one will be ignored.

[CSS `polygon()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape#polygon()):

>Each pair argument in the list represents x^i and y^i - the x and y axis coordinates of the 'i'th vertex of the polygon.

So, they're both lists of points, the `clip-path` just adds some comma separation and includes the unit in-line.  Here's a box as an example:

    <polygon points=""0 0 0 100 100 100 100 0"">
	-->
	<style>
		div {
			clip-path: polygon( 0px 0px, 0px 100px, 100px 100px, 100px 0px );
		}
	</style>
	
That's assuming your SVG uses pixel units. If it doesn't, you'll have to convert them to a system CSS understands.  

`clip-path` can also use `percentages`, which allow the path to stretch and squash according the dimensions of its element:

    clip-path: polygon( 0% 0%, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, 100% 0% );
	
I don't know of a tool that will do this for you, but it's a fairly simple calculation - you can use the SVG's `viewBox` as your 100% sizes and calculate each coordinate as percentages of that.",1531045033.0
cauners,"As u/jotted noted, SVG and CSS clip-path polygons are basically the same. I once wrote a little code snippet that generates clip-path rules from SVG's - but I was lazy, so when creating the SVG, I made a 100x100px large artboard, so all the point coordinates would fit in 0 - 100 range. [Here is the snippet](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/QxeoqO) if you are interested - just change the existing SVG with your own (with an artboard of 100x100px and id Layer_1).

anonymousmouse2,"I wanted to point out that the way you’ve handled your columns isn’t the best way to achieve this. The beauty of CSS grid is that there are special units that make it so you don’t have to use percents, specifically the fr unit https://alligator.io/css/css-grid-layout-fr-unit/

In the COLUMNS section, you’re calculating the column width based on the width of the design (1290px) with column width (54px). If you’re building a responsive website you should be avoiding fixed widths like that. All you really need to do is find the total number of columns “n” and set up your grid-template-columns as the total number of columns to span times n.

So you can greatly simplify your columns:

    /* change this */
    grid-template-columns: 4.06504065% 12.814556717% 18.81533101% 13.008130081% 2.322880372% 8.439798684% 8.594657375% 23.228803717% 8.713372048%;

jacobmc8,"Instead of doing:
 “grid-column-start:1;
grid-column-end:5; “

You can do: 
“grid-column: 1/6; “

For the same result and less writing. It would be 6, because it is referring to the grid lines, and grid-column line 1 is the left border of the screen in this case. 

You can do the same thing with rows, just write “grid-row:” instead of “grid-column:”. Just keep in mind that, again, it is counting the lines. So “grid-row: 1/2;” would just be the first row because row-line 1 is the top border. Your ending number (in this example 2) is always one more than the row/column you want filled in. If you want row one filled in, it is 1/2; if you want row one AND two filled in, it is 1/3. You catch on quick & it saves a lot of writing.

I structure a basic page with a linked style sheet and a completely empty body.

I end up with a huge page of easily identifiable divs, as well as progressive skill being easily visible. 

How to teach it without laptops? Ask for their input. Make it interactive. Ask for their suggestions of what to do with each div. you do the first one without instruction.

Woodcharles,"Recently planned and delivered some CSS lectures on a similar course (although we had laptops in lectures. A course that won't let you have laptops in lectures is mental).

First tip, I skipped floats. Most students in any kind of tech course have probably had a look at free resources already and made the barest basics of a site, so they can already set font-size and whatever, and therefore they've seen float, and I decided if they wanted to go home and teach themselves the old float logic, fine, but I had limited time and I was going to teach Flexbox. It was also a full-stack course and we needed things to look good fast. There'd be time later, if they wanted, to look at intricacies.

So first, go down the Flexbox route. Chris Coyier's Guide to Flexbox is excellent. Make some boxes, move 'em around, justify over here and there, show them flex-grow because it's quite useful, and there. Also vertical centering in 3 lines is pure joy. Hopefully the whole 'box' thing, parents and children, becomes clear when you're using terms like 'wrapper' and children, but often I would put a border around the wrapper div/Flex item so they could see exactly what I meant.

Classes and IDs. Discourage altering the base element, and this then allows you to explain the Cascading side of things, and inheritance.

Margins and padding: talk about when to use but also when not to use. Don't get them into bad habits like minus-numbers hacking the left margins just to force things into position. For the level they're at they should be able to get things looking good naturally without brute force.

Using the dev tools. Seeing what CSS is affecting which parts, and also turning them on and off again with the checkboxes, to see how this alters behaviour. Excellent for debugging and has been valuable since I started in a development role.

For full layouts, touch on Grid (admittedly I have not done Grid yet, I find it.... cumbersome) and Bootstrap 4, if possible. I didn't learn or teach Bootstrap on the course - I had some experience of 3, wasn't a fan, but was a big fan of Flex and found the transition to 4 fairly easy. It gets them thinking about the page as  a whole and not just little flexy-divs all over, and simplifies things like modals, carousels etc that new students are going to enjoy using (until they become old and jaded.)

I also had a short chat on CSS animations, just the simple stuff, so that once their layout was done they could bring it to life with simple hover effects, fade-ins, transitions, shadows and so on. Didn't take long but it got them started in terms of thinking about users, making things look a little more professional. Some students might still disregard the tips and make something that looks like Geocities circa 1998 but overall it shows them that it doesn't take much to get something quite clean, easy on the eye and even responsive in a short amount of time.

But it's also something I reiterated they'd have to go home and practise. They needed their fingers to type and their eyes to see the results and get that feel for predicting element behaviour.",1530433987.0

The issue is how you're defining your animation.  


So here's your fadeInLeft animation definition:  
```
@keyframes fadeInLeft {

  from {

opacity: 0;

position: relative;

right: 300px; }

  to {

opacity: 1;

position: relative;

left: 0px; } }  
```


Everything looks great, except for your left/right properties.

In a keyframe animation, you define the start and end values of your properties and the browser figures out the in-between values depending on the timing. If you specify a value in the start, but then don't specify it again, it is not animated and instead stays the same throughout your animation. If you specify a property for the first time at a specific endpoint, that property is not applied until that point in the animation is reached.

  
Note you're saying `right: 300px` at the start of the animation, but then don't mention `right` again. **that means throughout your entire animation right will be 300px.** You also specify `left` at the very end of your animation. **That means left will be undefined (or default value) until the last frame of your animation**. This is the cause of the alleged choppiness.

To fix your animation simply use consistent properties between the start and end. For example, changing `left: 0px` to `right: 0` in the `to` block makes the animation look good on my end in Chrome.

Btw units are optional if the value is 0 (0px is the same value as 0% and 0em, etc). You also only need to mention `position: relative` in the `from`.

Q12: Use flexbox, set `flex-basis: 50%` on both flex items.  Then, within each flex item, add an additional element and set `padding: 20px`.  You need an extra element in order to avoid certain IE bugs ([info here](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs#flexbug-7)]).

DOG-ZILLA,"Your SCSS is not the worst I’ve seen (one contractor nested 20 levels deep in my codebase once...urghh) but I would recommend moving your anchor rule to the same level as your LI. 

There’s no need to match the nesting of HTML in your SCSS. One doesn’t have to directly reflect the other. This is a common mistake that people new to SCSS tend to make. 

Generally it’s good practice to try and keep your SCSS as flat as possible. It makes maintaining things easier and reduces too much specificity. 

If you’re nesting more than 3/4 levels deep, then it’s usually a good indication that there’s something wrong and in turn, a better way to do it. 

I would suggest: 

ul {
  li {}
  a {}
}

Formatting is probably wrong as I’m on mobile app. 

To get better at SCSS, it’s a good idea to examine the output it generates. I like to test little snippets in something like https://www.sassmeister.com before running with it in my apps. 

Good luck! ",1529570103.0
road_pizza,"Yeah it just sends up with longer selectors than needed increasing the size of your css file. As well as complicating things later on if you want to change styles, change the markup or something else. It's not the end of the world, but generally it's good advice to avoid going deeper than you need to, and try to select things with classes rather than by tag name if there is any chance the markup might change later.

The example you showed is really not that big a deal in my opinion. However I wouldn't want to get deeper than this. If the .feature\_nav element gets more complicated you could just nest the child selectors/classes within that one class instead of nesting all the way down.

I often nest things inside a class for the main element. The same way you have done with .feature\_nav but then I'll avoid nesting more than one level deep unless I have a good reason for it. In particular I find nav elements good candidates for nesting and selecting by tag names because it makes the relationships in your scss easy to understand and it's rare your nav will change very much and include tags other than ul, li and a.

TLDR: It's not good practise, however your example is mild and nothing to be very concerned about.",1529569880.0
shoebo,"Like others have said, flat is better. But I want to add on and say, its better because flat css is more flexible to change. I try to write all my html such that you can cut and move html blocks to different parts of the page without breaking anything. If the selector has a long dependency chain, you’ll have to do css maintenance every time you refactor/adjust. 

Secondly, selecting via css class names has the side-effect of commenting the css. Eventually a pile of unnamed tag-based selectors becomes difficult to grok. 

In the end, temper this with just whatever makes things easiest. Maybe the nesting is best in your situation, you can determine that.",1529602845.0

That's not always doable - particularly if you are coding for a CMS.

As long as you always plan on using an ordered list with links inside it, what you have is fine for your nav bar. Just remember, always try to be as least specific as possible when nesting tags, so that you can easily override them later for variations of your style.

Not sure if those `!important`'s are necessary in _your_ setup, but I was doing this in Chrome's inspector so it was easier for me to do it this way.

Animating `height` is a problem. However you can animate `max-height`. Go figure.

By setting the 'open' `max-height` value to a number that'll be big enough to work for all elements, you'll get a nice animation to show the elements when you hover.",1529475975.0

StarryNights78,translate is typically used for animations while left is used with the position property to specify the position of an element. ,1529431692.0
lamb_pudding,"`left: 200px` can have different behaviors based on the `position` declaration. [MDN has a good summary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/left):

* When position is set to absolute or fixed, the left property specifies the distance between the element's left edge and the left edge of its containing block. (The containing block is the ancestor to which the element is relatively positioned.)
* When position is set to relative, the left property specifies the distance the element's left edge is moved to the right from its normal position.
* When position is set to sticky, the left property behaves like its position is relative when the element is inside the viewport, and like its position is fixed when it is outside.
* When position is set to static, the left property has no effect.

Basically, position left is defining where the left edge of the elements box will sit. 

\`transform\` on the other hand is more of a transformation of where your element is drawn. \`transform: translateX(200px)\` will take the drawn pixels of the element and shift them over 200px. This is why it is efficient for animations. When changing \`left\` the browser has to run through the layout phase again because left may have changed how things were laid out. \`transform\` on the other hand will not affect layout. It just moves the drawn pixels around, therefore the browser knows it does not have to run the layout phase again.

Another caveat is \`left: 100&#37;\` will set left to 100&#37; of the value of the width of the elements containing box (its parent in basic terms). \`transform: translateX(100&#37;)\` will move the box over 100&#37; of its own width. It has does not do a calculation from the parent.",1529433010.0

buildawesomewebsites,"Systems like this breakdown when trying to manage state, and manage a site's layout structure across breakpoints.

When CSS classes CONTAIN certain properties and values, rather than EQUATE to certain properties and values,  it's much easier to:

1. Update the properties and values of the class across media queries (And not just screen size media query breakpoints, but also things like print media queries)
2. Leverage the cascade and provide state classes which override default or static states by leveraging more specific CSS selector combinations.
3. Debug in an inspector when an element only references a few CSS selectors.
4. Utilize Javascript to add or swap classes to alter state.
5. Use or not use CSS Transitions or Animations.
6. etc...

I think the intentions of these types of CSS libraries is to simplify CSS and make it more ""lightweight"" - but the complexity has to lie somewhere - so when you use CSS where ""class equals property: value"" -  the complexity shifts to the DOM structure, which is not a place where you want styling complexity to be. It's not a matter of ""oh there are so many classes on the element and its ugly"" - it's a matter of ""holy crap there are so many classes to manage across all my states.""

If the web was made up of fixed-width, static documents - a method like this might be justifiable - but otherwise it creates more problems than it solves.

It just breaks down in so many ways - but theoretically I could see it being used for a ""chrome layer"" (colors, borders, etc.) on something like a static landing page or email (not sure how supported CSS is in email - been a while since I looked int that.)",1529514719.0

karabaja81,"You can definitely use flex box to achieve such a design, no problems. I’ve build entire websites out of flexbox, way more complicated designs than this. Flexbox is awesome.

Put the container of both elements to flexbox, and flex-direction : row (default), was then wrap each of the two sides in flexbox, change the direction to column. On the right one you might use center align or stretch, whatever fits your needs best. Then wrap the two buttons in a flexbox container with justify content space between. Something like this. 

If you could use css grid that would be the way to go too, it works great with flexbox, however I don’t think it’s compatible enough across platforms.

Also, for responsive, just switch your outer wrapper to flex direction column and it shouldn’t be too much work from there.

anti-anti,"Looks like a nice start, it seems like a very cool project! I've written some notes on what you have so far, and there are also some other topics you could add in in future.

### Notes

- For challenges after challenge 0 the help modal doesn't pop up automatically... not sure if this is intentional but if so maybe you could add a message at the beginning directing people to click on the question mark icon for a hint
- Maybe you could add some navigation buttons to allow users to go back to the previous challenge
- **Challenge 0:** _""The display property on a container is what makes it a grid. 
This doesn't really do anything by itself. The container turns it into a grid, but since there are no columns **or rows** it looks the same.""_  
This is not really true, there are rows as soon as you set the `display` property to `grid`, it's just as if you had `grid-auto-rows` set to  `auto`
- **Challenge 1:** you mention setting `grid-template-rows` to something like `100px 200px 100px`, and link to the MDN docs on CSS lengths, but then in challenge 2 the `grid-template-rows` prop is set to `1fr 1fr 1fr`, without having introduced what a `fr` unit is... I don't think it's necessary to link to the CSS lengths docs, since people learning about CSS grid are probably already comfortable enough with the basic lengths in CSS and that page has quite a bit of information that isn't really relevant to CSS grid. Maybe you could link to the docs on `grid-template-rows` instead, but ideally you would take some more time to walk the user through `fr` units
- **Challenge 1:** maybe you could also mention the `repeat` function
- **Challenge 2:** you say that `grid-gap` can take two parameters, maybe you can mention that `grid-gap` is a shorthand that combines `grid-row-gap` and `grid-column-gap` and explain the difference in behavior when one value is provided vs two. I don't think you really need to link the CSS lengths docs again here.
- **Challenge 3:** I think the diagram is useful in explaining the grid lines, which is something that can be confusing. However, I think it could be clearer if you marked one of the grid 'cells' (like by putting an `x` in the middle), and then changing your code example from `grid-column: A / B; grid-row: C / D` to the values that would be needed to place something in the marked cell. You could also provide the same code example in two ways - one using the long form of `grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end`, and then one using the shorthand. Maybe you could also mention the fact that you don't necessarily need to provide a `grid-column-end` value.
- **Challenge 3:** Another thing you could mention here is the ability to span columns/rows instead of defining an end column.
- **Challenge 3:** And another thing you could (maybe) mention is that you can use a value of `-1` to indicate the last row/column.. but then you might have to get into when this doesn't work (ie. when using a non-fixed number of columns/rows)
- **Challenge 3:** There's also a typo in the code section of this challenge, `grid-template-column` should be `grid-template-columns`.
- **Challenge 4:** Again, maybe you could relate your code example to the diagram, so instead of `grid-template-areas: 'area-1 area-2'`, you could put the actual names used in the diagram. Maybe you could also mention that people often separate these strings into separate lines, which makes it easier to visualise the grid layout.
- **Challenge 4:** Here you mention the dimensions of each of the areas (eg. the sidebar should be 300px), but maybe it's not necessary to include this information
- **Challenge 4:** You could also mention the `grid-area` property for placing grid items. I know you include it in the code section, but putting it in the hint as well might be useful.
- **Challenge 4:** if I input `'header header' 'sidebar content' 'footer footer'` as the answer it's marked as incorrect, but if I input `'header header' 'sidebar content' ""footer footer""` it's OK

### Additional topics
- `grid-template-rows` vs `grid-auto-rows`
- `grid-auto-flow`
- `minmax` function
- `repeat` function
- `justify-items` and `align-items` / `place-items`
- `justify-content` and `align-content` / `place-content` and how this differs from the above
- `justify-self` and `align-self` / `place-self`
- `fr` units
- naming lines
- `grid` shorthand syntax (if you want... I never use this because I find it too hard to remember what goes where)",1528321857.0
ShadowpathHD,"Usually, you want to use a wrapper when you're putting a multitude of content within the same 'wrapping container', meaning you want them to be the same width or height.

MigasTavo,"I believe it is 50% pf parent's width. The problem that you describe happens when you apply 50% margin to an element in order to center it.
What it happens is that the element takes all that margin, and then it starts to renders at that point, so it is always going to look a bit out of center, depending on the element size.

One easy solution is use transform: translate to correct it. Lets say you have a element with a margin-left: 50%. Apply transform: translateX(-50%). The transform percentage refers to the width of the element, unlike the margin.

anti-anti,"I think it helps to look at the layout you have and try to visualise the grid lines in your head before starting to create your grid. With the screenshot you posted, you would need to have 4 rows in order to achieve the layout you want.

So you can update your `grid-template-rows` to `200px 140px 140px 200px` (or if you want you could use `200px repeat(2, 140px) 200px` (this is assuming you'll add `grid-gap: 20px` to your grid)

Then areas `2`, `5` and `6` each need to span 2 rows. You can use `grid-row: 2 / span 2` instead of `grid-row: 2 / 4`, I find it easier to keep track of things that way.

**Edit:** you also talked about explicitly defining each area. If you wanted to name each of the template areas, you could do something like this:

    .grid-container {
      grid-template-areas:
        'header      header       right-top'
        'hero        hero         right-top'
        'footer-left footer-right right-bottom'
      }
    }

Then in each area you could remove `grid-row` and `grid-column` and instead put `grid-area: header` (or whatever). You can find more information about grid template areas [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas).",1527710149.0

newkid84,"Well, it's hard to tell without seeing the css file, but a couple o quick solutions:

**Align the ""Accomplishments and Work"" columns:** Most likely you have those columns separated by divs. To align them, you could use:

 margin\-top: {value}; eg: margin\-top: 10px; \(check the right value, by testing\)

**A possible better way to list the PROGRAMS towards the bottom. Maybe a bullet list?:** a list, using icons in the left. You could use [https://fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com) for the icons. The only downside is that using font icons is a little more tricky. But a simple list would do it. Example:

That's the simplest way. You'd add rules between those style tags. 

The *correct* way is to place a text file like ""main.css"" in a directory above your `index.html` file, or whatever file you're building. So you might have a directory structure that looks like

          - ImageFolder
          - JavascriptFolder
          - Index.html file

 And then on index.html, add this between the `<head></head>` tags:

`<link href=""CSSFolder/main.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" />`

Note that in `main.css`, you do not need (in fact you should not have, as they'll break it) the `<Style>` tags. Just add rules there.

I don't think you'll be able to have your width depend on your height without any JS.  
Although having your height depend on your width is possible, so maybe with some ultimate CSS hacking, but I'd bet it would bring more problem than it would solve.

A ""close enough"" solution could be to add several media queries on your viewport's height and adapt the cards to have roughly the correct width around your breakpoints.

An example:

    @media (min-height: 500px) and (max-height: 699px) {

ajkandy,"Sure. Let’s break it down by paragraph. 

_The automatic minimum size for a grid item in a given dimension is its specified size if it exists_

So, presuming your grid tracks have no inherent sizing applied to them in their CSS grid definition, your item’s direct size will apply. If it’s a div or img set to 250px wide, boom, that’s its automatic minimum size.

_otherwise its transferred size if that exists_

So if your item doesn’t have a specified size, Grid will fall back to the flexbox size it calculates for that item’s min-width, for instance, if you have a flex context and you’re applying an aspect ratio to an image, once it calculates all the flex sizing/spacing, that size becomes the minimum size.

_else its content size, each as defined in [CSS-FLEXBOX-1]_ 

This is defined by flex-basis:content, ie as a child item in a flex context, size it to its intrinsic content size, then let the flex algorithm figure out the rest.


_However, if the grid item spans only grid tracks that have a fixed max track sizing function_

So, if you DO have an intrinsic maximum size applied to your grid tracks...

_its specified size and content size in that dimension (and the input to the transferred size in the other dimension) are further clamped to less than or equal to the stretch fit the grid area’s size_

Then the grid track size takes precedence, affecting any flex sizing calculations (ie the ‘input’ to the equation that calculates size based on aspect ratio, or flex-basis) and limiting the item’s size to the fixed-size grid area in question... 

 _(so as to prevent the automatic minimum size from forcing overflow of its fixed-size grid area)_

If its minimum size would normally have been larger than the fixed track it’s currently inside, it clamps the size to prevent overflow. 

The CSS Working Group’s documentation is very precise, but it is not at all friendly for normal humans to read. 

CSS-Tricks has a much more friendly guide to Flexbox (google it) and check out Jen Simmons’ complete FREE video course Layout Land on YouTube to learn all about Grid.

1. The modal itself needs to be absolutely positioned within a fixed overlay that takes up the entire screen. This way - it will ""sit on top"" of all the rest of the content on the page and not be interfered with.

2. The modal needs a max-height. Without it, the modal will extend beyond the screen, and trigger the browser scroll bar.

3. The modal needs a property of overflow-y: scroll. When the content of the modal exceeds the max-height, it will create a scroll bar on the modal.

I suggest shopping the shelf on this one and use a pre-made modal solution like this: https://noelboss.github.io/featherlight/",1526179795.0

You can spend so many hours screwing around with the details to save half a second of load time… and then discover that it's not compatible with some legacy browser half your users are still running, whereas Bootstrap takes care of all that for you at a fairly minimal cost.

For example, I knocked together a nice grid the first day setting up a new website, loaded it in IE11 and realized that's one of the elements they don't support… so went and downloaded Bootstrap and redid the grid in *there* and it works happily on all platforms now. (And yes, IE11 is the primary browser for this project for the foreseeable future because some of the original websites were built a decade ago and aren't done being revamped by their code owners yet.)

As long as the radio button itself and the text label for the button are children of a parent element which has **display:flex** declared.

Then, you can use **align-items: center** in order to vertically center them in relation to one another.

So the markup would look something like this:

    <label class=""radioButtonComponent"" for=""radio"">
      <input class=""radioButtonComponent_input"" type=""radio"" />
      <span class=""radioButtonComponent_description"">This is a label</span>

      display: flex;

2) There is a semicolon - both width:100%; and height:40px; are valid. This causes mayhem in layout.    

3)     width:100% is removed - the next line becomes valid, thus height:40px starts working and causes layout problems.

1: Use z-index, make sure the icons have a value lower than the ""notification tab"" divs. So something like this:

.tabs {z-index: 10;}

(I would recommend against this solution, as it only 'hides' the icons, use n° 2 instead:)

2: Use height in combination with overflow-y: scroll, instead of position absolute. This will prevent anything from showing up after a certain point. So something like this:

* [DevDocs.io](https://devdocs.io/) - A quick offline-cached version of several pieces of documentation, including some from MDN.
* [W3C CSS specification](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) - In the past, I would point you directly to [CSS 2.1 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/), but now the specs have been expanded and split into [several modules](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work).
    * Still, if you want **one single document** that explains and defines 90%~95% of CSS used today, [CSS 2.1 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) (or [CSS 2.2 preview](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/)) is still a good one. Then, whenever needed, you can read other documents and pages to learn more about the new features.

Other nice resources:

* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) - I always go to it when working with [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).
* [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) - A place where people share some HTML/CSS/JS snippets and experiments.

grdivrag,"The best place to start is \(obviously\) HTML. Do all the markup first \- define container elements and fill them with text, images.

In Google Chrome you can open the DevTools \(F12\) and set your viewport to simulate a mobile phone \(the icon next to Elements, or hit CTRL\+Shift\+M\). This should give you a better feeling for what you are doing.

ajkandy,"It’s been done for decades? Most websites that have a 2- or 3-column layout do this... only raw unformatted HTML would run off the edge of the screen as you seem to think. 

In the old days, we achieved this with tables (bad), then with floats and positioning (better) then we added media queries for responsive designs (better again) and now we have CSS Grid  to explicitly set layouts and handle spacing, etc. 

Text inside a container wraps inside it. Make the container the width you want, use CSS and media queries to adjust the layout for different viewport sizes to ensure a readable measure. 

On a 4K screen without scaling, everything gets smaller. People are still not going to want to read miles-long sentences, so that’s why the browser has zoom settings. Usually the browser is not running full screen, so layouts appear normal. If run in full screen, they usually have some kind of maximum width on the content area; this may result in large columns of white space, but it’s still readable.

binocular_gems,"Necessary?  No.  But they provide a lot of common utilities and often make more extensible, easier to share applications.  If I'm coming to a freelance project and the previous (or current) developer used Bootstrap, Foundation, MDL Lite, or any of the other common, well-documented frameworks, then it's way quicker for me to jump into development... I know the documentation is good, I can figure out exactly what they're doing easily, and everything will be a lot more clear immediately because we're speaking the same front-end language.  If coming to a project where someone made their own framework, or their own grid, or uses their own system, it's a lot more work for me to figure out, you know it's not going to have any documentation, and it significantly cuts into my development time.

At big companies, as well, there is a benefit to using a common framework.  I work at an organization with ~4500 employees, ~50% of whom are developers, and it's nice that we use Bootstrap because it creates a common language that we all understand.  Before that, we developed our own grid framework based off of 960gs, but even with that framework and prior to doing that, every app rolled their own front-end in some way and things were incredibly inconsistent.  It was slow for new developers to get started doing work, it was difficult for teams to work together, and any times multiple apps needed to interface with each other in some way, it made that more challenging.  Bootstrap also provides a nice single-source-of-truth for design, UX, and development decisions.  We've elevated it to an authority in our organization, so we can end fruitless debates more quickly by saying, ""Well... Bootstrap does it this way..."" and it helps quell the endless churn that a lot of projects have when you have different people with strong, divergent opinions.

It also helps with design and development conflicts, where now all of our designers are designing to a 12-column grid, something that they didn't do 5+ years ago, and so not only is every developer in the organization generally on board with Bootstrap, but our dozens of designers are as well, so we're all speaking the same language and it speeds up prototypes -> production build process immensely.

For bloat... in most of our applications, we don't really care.  First, Bootstrap doesn't have that much bloat considering what you're getting from it, but also, our apps have dozens of JS libraries, and we still use some really old legacy frameworks/libraries that are much bigger bloat hogs than Bootstrap or Foundation are.

When I hire new developers, a major plus for me is that they have experience working with frameworks.  I don't want somebody who is going to dismiss the framework out of hand, which is something you see from a lot of independent or small-agency developers.  We're a major company, we're opinionated as a company, we have a process and standards, and if a developer has a lot of friction with a framework like Bootstrap, Foundation, or what have you, then they're likely going to have a lot of friction with the dozens of other standards and processes that we have in place...

UncriticalEye,"I faced this question about 8 months ago for a project at work. As one of my first steps, i went though this course that helps you decide on which framework is best for you, what to consider, the risks and benefits, etc. I found it very helpful.

* [CSS: Frameworks & Grids](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Frameworks-Grids-2016-Q3-REVISION/504266-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a9%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3aframeworks%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2)

(This is a subscription site, but you can still watch with a 30 day free trial.)

Since you mentioned CSS Grid, one thing to note: Almost all frameworks include a grid system based on DIVS and floats, but this approach to layout is rapidly becoming obsolete, in favor of CSS Grid (and Flexbox).  So, whatever framework you use, you can leverage everything it includes *except for* the built-in grid system, and instead design your layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox. (There is a note to this effect near the very end of the course I linked above.)

Incidentally, Lynda.com also has a good course on CSS Grid. The Wes Bos course someone else mentioned is probably better, but this is another option:

If you do go with a framework, you can't go too wrong with ~~Bootcamp~~ Bootstrap. Sure, everything will look like ~~Bootcamp~~ Bootstrap, but everything already does, so no worries.

Also, I like the cut of Pure's jib (the Pure framework). It's a bit wordy, but it looks pretty nice and seems fairly complete.

If `contentarea` could only exist as a thing in `container`, then it's an element and should be referenced `.container__contentarea { ... }`

No, not at all. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length

Personally, I only use them for font sizes, though. In my experience it is much better to use `vmin` for spacing as it properly scales based on your screen size.

Get to a level of knowledge and confidence in it where you can make your own judgement on the weight of relevance of new information. There is a lot of misinformation, half or less correct, clickbait info out there. Distrust by default seems to be the best way of approaching info on blogs.
The people in the CSSWG is a good circle to follow and the people they interact with also.

Know where specifications can be found and realise that specifications are written for implementors. Get familiar with the lingo used in specs and know how to translate them to a form that is useful to you as a developer.

Do not jump on every new trend and do not believe all the propaganda that is spread to make you believe that some way is the best way of ""doing CSS"".
People are trying to sell you their library or paradigm. CSS is a versatile, glorious concept superbly implemented in browsers. At every level of knowledge it will click and seem as you grasp the concepts. But it will hold a level of new knowledge almost always. Dig deeper and stay hungry. Do not get demotivated about the immense mountain of information there is in front of you, CSS is very good at being used on every level of knowledge. Give yourself at least 5 years to learn everything thoroughly, it will pay off in the end.

If I may propose some sort of a roadmap of topics to follow. It's probably best to glance over future topics once in a while and really dig into each after the other when confident about that topic.

* the basics (block elements vs inline elements)
* which style properties are there
* selectors
* what is the cascade and what are the default styles applied
* what is specificity
* what is the DOM and what is a render tree
* how do the in browser developer tools work and how can they make your life easier
* how does CSS gets parsed into CSSOM
* what is @media
* how does a browser apply styles to elements and why
* what is inheritance exactly
* how do properties really work (specified, computed, used and actual values)
* how does a browser layout elements
* how does a browser paint/render elements
* how does a browser handle changing properties that affect layout or paint
* what is a stacking context and what triggers it
* how do all these concepts affect the way you should write and maintain CSS

Mestyo,"Avoid [magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming) to the best of your ability. CSS has [many different ways of expressing lengths](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length), so if you need a distance that represents the x-height of a font, instead of trying to figure out that with your current font-face and font-size that value should be `14px`; just use use `1ex`.

On a highly related note, the ability to assign names to values through variables and combine them is one of the greatest features of CSS preprocessing that nobody talks about. Coming across a random `38px` value in a code base will likely make you wonder how, what and why that value is what it is, while `$imageWidth + $gutterLarge` perfectly explains the value and its composing parts perfectly.

As a rule of thumb: understanding *why* is more important than figuring out *what* a value should be.

Other than that, find a way to modularize your CSS, possibly through a combination of a BEM-like naming convention and a CSS preprocessor. Keep selectors simple; don't nest, don't select by element type. One class name is enough for the basic baseline selector, and only start combining class names when you need to force something through. Otherwise, rely on the cascade.",1523696758.0

       }
       .main-container{
            // good

       .header-xxx-large{

Why?


Because your style should not be hard coupled to your DOM tags or anchors. Your webpage should look neat and tidy without any styles (although obviously ugly and dated) and your tags such as H1, H2, P, ARTICLE, FOOTER should only denote functional areas of the website and not decorators. It should read (without styles) like a schematic.


This is especially important because of accessibility, where tag names look different to people who can't see the website vs. those who can.

You can continue implementing everything bootstrap does, swapping of columns/rows, hidding/showing on certain breakpoints, offsets, etc.

And change your caption markup to this:

**Explanation:** Adding a `.child` class to your `figcaption` with `display: flex;` makes it a flex container within which you can create another child `div`.

That child `div` can now be manipulated as a flex item. `width: 0` removes the width of the `div` housing the text, and `flex-grow: 1` allows it to adopt the width of its container (which is taking on the width of its first child due to your other CSS declarations).

Your CSS selector is this: `.side .md [href$=""http://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTraderNetwork/wiki/network""]`

This looks fine when the page renders, but you'll notice that when you click on this link, the URL changes to something else...  I can't copy and paste what it changes to but I took a screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/e4yz17n.png

As you can see, this URL is different than the one that you identify in your CSS when trying to target that element.

So, the issue is because your URL changes when you click on it, and your CSS selector is written the way that it is, the CSS rule ends up not getting applied at the point of clicking on it.  Perhaps this URL rewriting, adding that meta, is some new feature recently rolled out by Reddit and so maybe that's why it used to work and now it doesn't.

I don't know what sort of limitations Reddit puts on how you can construct your markup and styles, but if you're able to rewrite that element adding a class to it, and then use that class as your selector, then it seems to work as expected.  I did a quick test in the browser adding a class of `foobarlink` to that element in the markup, and then changed the selector in CSS to be `.foobarlink { ... }` and the link worked as expected.  If Reddit does not allow you to add classes to elements another option is to use a wildcard when targeting that element with the URL, so if the URL changes it will still apply the rule, or finding some other way to target that link.",1523196296.0

cauners,"I am not an expert, but I suppose that's just how fonts work. Fonts have a baseline, and a character can extend above and beyond it.    

Consider [this example](https://i.imgur.com/Ip64elp.jpg).    

On top you can see the characters are ""on"" the baseline, but they can be higher than the baseline (like the plus and asterisk characters) or extend beyond the baseline (like character p). This vertical placement varies per font.    

On bottom I've centered the characters in the vertical middle relative to each others physical height. The vertical placement is weird and nonsensical, but such font would work in your case, because they all are in the middle relative to the baseline.    

So, unless your fonts characters of interest have the same physical height, there is no hack-less way to achieve what you want. Usually people don't encounter such a need because mostly the centered characters are the same ""type"", like numerical or capital letters, thus they probably have the same physical height.

what I would suggest you look at is :nth-child().
Use that to decide the style per div.
You would probably need to give some boxes a more specific styling.
What, to my knowledge, should be noted is that flexboxes work mainly in a column or a row way.
So having 1 in a top corner and placing the other div's in other places is most likely not possible if you use the div's back to back.
You will need multiple lines to achieve that.

I would suggest (as you are learning ) to look at mobile first.
Though at first it might be a bit tough it would help you in the future.

When building for mobile you can stretch everything and make them bigger.
The good part of that is that you don't need to worry about big content to not fit on the screen when make things smaller.

In your case you can use the flexbox order property to switch around elements and place them where you want them when moving to a bigger screen (when you use mobile first the other way around works to).

The closest thing I've seen to an acceptable implementation is what Vue does in their single file components. But even with theirs you have the potential for out-of-order style loading, though it is much less likely. It can be completely avoided though if you use their scoped styles option, which is very nice, but also increases the specificity of all selectors by 10 points. That's fairly minor, so I'd still say they have the best implementation, but even they have downsides.

Current best way to handle styling in an app is to use Sass and follow the Inverted Triangle CSS methodology. There's a TLDR on [GraphMyCSS.com](http://graphmycss.com). And if you are using Vue, then the ""Trumps"" are basically your scoped component specific styles.",1522801798.0

kylorhall,"I use `styled-components` on one large project, and a few small ones, but prefer `scss` + `css-modules`.  They both have limitations.  `scss` is pre-compiled and will have much larger download impact, but can be cached, while styled-components can be somewhat pre-compiled (in alpha?), but always requires some level of compilation and can't be cached.  Both have performance considerations – but in general, css in js is going to be worse, but surprisingly, not by that much – most of the time.

If you need to change styles and a class would never suffice, styling via javascript is really your own option – you could still use css for those situations and just fill in with `style`.  We needed to do branding on a per-user basis, and landed on `styled-components`.

The major drawbacks to developing `styled-components` for me is doing math and stuff..  Most mixins are easier and more verbose, but working with variables is a lot more difficult.  Eg. scss: `padding: $gutter*2;` vs. styled-components: `padding: px(gutter * 2);`.  Using theme / props inside of an interpolation adds more annoying complexity – I have stuff like `color: ${props => rgba(readableColor('red')(props), .7)};`.

I don't think one will replace the other as theres reasons to use both.  Maybe both is the answer to your specific use-case.  In an ideal world, I'd have my styled-components precompile into css my most important styling per-page and then compile the rest on runtime – don't really that being possible today without a ton more complexity, but in the future, sure.

kuenx,"CSS doesn't provide selectors by content. It's probably best if you just add another class called e.g. `rating` to those elements.

If you don't have access to the code that generates the HTML you can add the class with JavaScript:

    function addRatingClass() {
      const nodeList = document.querySelectorAll('.chat');
      [].forEach.call(nodeList, function (node) {
        if (node.innerText.indexOf('rating') === -1) {
          return;

          return;
        }
        node.classList.add('rating');
      });
    }

This is if you need support for older browsers. In modern browsers that support ES6 you can write it like this:

    function addRatingClass() {
      [ ...document.querySelectorAll('.chat') ]
        .filter(node => node.innerText.includes('rating'))
        .forEach((node) => {

            return;
          }
          node.classList.add('rating');
         });
    }

You have to run `addRatingClass()` every time the the elements change to update the new ones.

road_pizza,"If CSS is causing frustrations then it's likely because there is some of the fundamental concepts that you haven't got yet. It can be frustrating in the beginning but it's important that you understand why things work and don't work and not just instead of just getting it done and moving on.

That example you posted is someone trying to use flex-box for a grid system which is not what it's best at doing or recommended to be used for. Flex-box made some things easier but it's not a tool to be used for everything.

Reading over the spec all at once seems pretty useless to me. I'd recommend choosing one aspect, reading up on that one thing and doing some coding over and over again in codepen until you understand how it works and start to remember some of the code. Then choose something else, read up on that one thing and practise it until you get it. Then repeat.

I'd recommend learning how the cascade works and how to select things. Do some googling and open up code pen to practise.

Then go practise with display properties and how it effects things and what properties can be used on different display types. The difference between block and inline block is important and crucial to know.
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp

Then get CSS positioning figured out. How relative and absolute positions work together often stumps people until they spend some time to understand it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kejG8G0dr5U
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.asp

Then read up on floats and practise with them.

Don't forget the box model either.
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp

Once you've got that stuff down you'll be on the way to re-creating most layouts you see online.

Then try out flex box and you'll be able to see what issues it actually solves and where it's appropriate to use it.
https://flexboxfroggy.com
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

It just takes spending focussed effort on learning one part at a time before moving on. There are concepts in CSS that are hard to understand the first time, but then once you get it and repeat it a few times you'll soon be using it without much effort. After a while you'll have a good understanding of the fundamentals so that coding becomes more fun then frustrating.

There's nothing wrong with you. Don't underestimate the value of taking each fundamental concept slowly at first and then taking the time to apply that new knowledge to solve your own problems. That way you'll build up your own mental model of how things work and thats when the knowledge really sets in.

skidmark_zuckerberg,"Here's the working Codepen:

https://codepen.io/anon/pen/oqqYbB

First things first, you have to put the text block you want centered inside of the container that gets the background image. The HTML reflects this change, so check that out first. This lets us set the parent #particles-js container's position to relative to make the absolute position on #hello valid.

Now, to the CSS. I removed the width from the #particles-js container, and added 100vh as the height value. This will make the container the height of the viewport, regardless of size. The width that was set to 100% was throwing off the container in Codepen specifically so note that you may need to add this back in for the browser.

I also changed the position of the parent #particles-js container from absolute to relative. Reason being is that to keep the child element only fixed within the parent container, the parent container must have a relative position for any child with an absolute position to abide by the parent container's borders. Alternatively you can use a fixed position here on the text element, but it will make the text span completely independent from it's parent container.

Moving onto the actual text you wanted centered. It is now wrapped in a <span> tag and moved inside of the #particles-js container. Setting the position to absolute will now work because it is now inside of the #particles-js parent container that has a relative position. You were close with:

  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;

but you needed to add:

transform: translate(-50%, -50%)

This will split the difference with the top/left values and put the element dead smack in the center. You now are left with an element that will stay perfectly centered, regardless of viewport width/height.

Another thing: margin: 0 auto was removed from #hello. It will not work here. The top/left and transform properties are handling the centering. ",1522387721.0

Regarding the `width: 100%`, I'm not quite sure what you mean by that because you said you want them all to be 250x165px, but you can achieve that by setting `flex-basis`, `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink`. Example: https://codepen.io/woubuc/pen/mxpazp

* `absolute` – ""pin"" an element to a specific spot in relation to its parent or ancestors; e.g. stick a social media menu at the top right corner of your header
* `fixed` – stick your element to a single, unchanging place based on the browser size; e.g. make a header menu stay at the top of the screen at all times, even when scrolling down
* `static` – element stack vertically or inline according to their ""display"" value; e.g. the default behavior

kylorhall,"This is how browsers work, and for good reason – you don't want for your browser to wait until it loads 10mb of images when you visit a website, so your browser loads enough to have a meaningful paint, and paints it, while it figures out what to load and loads it as quick as it can.

Something like `<link rel=""preload"" as=""image"" href=""/img/img.png"">` will help a lot (pretty sure that's the syntax – may need `crossorigin` and/or some other options) – [NOTE: not widely available at ~60%](https://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-preload).  [See the MDN article on it.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content)  With that, it will tell the browser ""hey, just load this"" rather than the browser waiting until the browser loads your css file and then figures out it needs to load the background image.  Then, when it does get to your css file, it already has loaded it, or started to load.

There's other ways to ensure your background image is available before it paints, but they're not good ideas.  It's quite bad to block the browser's render just because you want that image to show.  You're making users wait longer.  Users don't like waiting and will leave.

jazzmoses,"Firstly, it's always good to provide a live example of the code e.g. codepen.

Secondly, it's good to know the terminology of flexbox. Flex containers have a main axis and cross axis, the absolute orientation of these depends upon the `flex-direction` property. In this case it sounds like you are probably using `flex-direction: row` (the default), so the main axis is left to right and the cross axis top to bottom. It sounds like you are trying to align the child element along the cross axis, but I'm not 100% sure

Thirdly, `justify-content` is a property which is applied to a parent element (flex container) whose display value is `flex`. It controls the alignment of child elements (flex items) along the main axis. Setting a `justify-content` value for a flex item will therefore have no effect.

If you want to control cross-axis alignment of flex items, you can use `align-items` (property set on the flex container to control all alignment of flex items) or `align-self` (property set on individual flex items to allow per item alignment). These properties are not really meant to fine-tune alignment, so here I would try setting `position` of the flex item in question to `relative` and using `top` or `bottom` to control fine cross-axis alignment.

Ob101010,"Practice. I use codepen.io for this ALOT. Grid isnt too bad, just play with it. Basically, when designing a whole site to use it, draw out your site on a piece of paper, then draw the grid lines over it, dividing it up. Then the HTML turns into something like :

    <div id=""header""></div>
    <div id=""nav""></div>
    <div id=""content"">
        <div id=""top""></div>
        <div id=""left""></div>
        <div id=""right""></div>
        <div id=""subcontent""></div>
        <div id=""whatever""></div>
     </div>
     <div id=""footer""></div>

This is a damn sight better than the 'old' ways.

After making the CSS (mobile first), then the media queries are only for repositioning.

Remember, a grid cell can also be a grid parent. They nest. You can get crazy complex and still tell from a glance of the HTML whats up.

Two of my experiments for you to play with:

TwinSwords,"The biggest surprise for me with CSS Grid was --how many different grids-- you need to do a whole page. In the tutorials they always focus on just one grid for the overall page layout. 

But when you build an actual page with actual content, you find you need (or can use) grid for layout at the component level. 

Flexbox compliments it nicely, depending on what part of your page you are designing.

You've probably seen these, but here are some good sources:

By Rachel Andrew, the person who made grid happen: https://gridbyexample.com/

2. Use it. I read a ton before actually using it but learned a ton more when I got down to writing code.

newkidonblockchain,"If you want a grid that takes up the entire height and width of your site, you can set the <body> tag to display: grid in CSS. 

It's actually better practice to do this:

</body>

and then build your site within the wrapper div as if it were the body tag, and of course set .wrapper to display: grid in CSS.",1521474880.0

You could always do 2 css for different screen-sizes, but grid defines in CSS, so you can a lot easier now than ever before.

So in short, grid isn't about making a static page. Grid is about making a page with default flows. making elements that you just have to throw stuff into, to make it align properly.

If your specific app or data model has a strongly-typed concept of a Car, then mimicking that structure in CSS can be very clarifying. Thus, using Tailwind in SASS to create your own custom ‘.Car’ class and then applying that as opposed to recreating the aesthetics of .Car using utility classes. It’s good to have a canonical component to represent the “things” in your app.

So really it depends. I don’t feel like there is a prevailing ideology and I’ve been writing and teaching CSS since ‘02. It’s always been a healthy mix of techniques and architectures.

MuddyBeard210,"I personally find myself using utility classes for layout and element specific names for cosmetic styling.  My go-to layout method is flexbox.

DusmaN121,"I've done this in the past and it eventually becomes unmanageable IMO. 

Recently, I've been exploring the idea of the element/component storing all relevant CSS Variables and values, which interact with their child components. 

If we have:

<div class=""my-component"">
     <div class=""button""></div>
</div>

Then .my-component passes down the properties for button via CSS Variables. I then only need a single .button and can make it large/small, light/dark, etc. 

It makes the .my-component class huge, but manageable and no issues with having tons of utility classes assigned in the HTML.

daiz-,"You're interpreting this incorrectly. 

> A position absolute element will be positioned based on the closest **positioned** *ancestor*. 

* Positioned means anything not static.  Absolute, Relative or any kind of positioning will do. A parent does not explicitly require relative. An absolute positioned element could take its position from inside another absolutely positioned element, as absolute is also a position.

* Ancestor means: Any parent, including the parents of that parent. The direct parent does not need a position, any single element in the dom tree will suffice. 

With that in mind... An absolutely positioned element will base its own positioning on the closest element that is also using a position. If none of those exist, it will bubble up the dom and is positioned based on the body.

In no case is position absolute ""effectively ignored"". It will always find the body.

But in order to position itself correctly, an element just needs another point of reference to understand where to base it's position from. If you ask your GPS for directions without it understanding where to start the directions from, it might pick from the only place it knows: the outskirts of town (body). But as soon as you give a parent some positioning,  you're saying ""give me directions starting from this corner(positioned element)"". 

Hopefully that helps. ",1520941540.0

cauners,"For a lot of companies javascript framework usage *is* frontend. So it really depends on what kind of position you are trying to get - if it's design and UX / UI, then your existing skillset might be enough (turning design into clickable mockups is a great skill on its own). If it's *frontend development*, learning javascript won't hurt, because js - heavy webapps are a thing now. It would make more sense for a company to hire someone who can write css and implement it in a framework than hiring one guy who creates the layout, css, and someone else who then takes it, dissects it and makes it work with a framework.    
So perhaps you are not looking in the right direction? I suppose, with your existing skills you could be one of these:    

* Great UX / UI designer who knows how CSS works (very important for designers) and can implement some of the design (for mockups, presentations etc.);

grasfahrer,"Well you have to think of any programming language (even CSS that is only for style) as actual languages. You have to learn how to speak that language in order to form sentences. I suggest you take a look on what the basic CSS properties do, and try building small elements with them. Once you're done with that, move to more advanced ones and start using them with the ones you've already learned.

Do that until you're able to ""think in code"", the same way you do when you speak your mother language.

Once you become more or less fluent in whatever language you're learning, you'll be able to start working on actual projects. It takes time and effort, but it surely pays off. Plus you don't struggle with small tweaks here and there.

Also, there's nothing wrong with using StackOverflow or using someone else's code as a resource for your studying. I've been working with web development for almost 8 years and I've done that my entire career. The problem is when you just copy and paste, because you don't learn. Whenever you need to take a look at someone else's code, try reading it and understanding how it works before putting it in your code. – I find it very useful to write down exactly the same code as I try to understand it.

_________________________
First of all, look at this talk to get the inspiration flowing:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txZq7Laz7_4  
(It's an awesome talk that answers large parts of your question)

I like to follow the rule of thumb that flexboxes is for one-dimensional data (like lists of items) and css-grid is for two dimensional data (like layout)

Now learn the basics here:  
http://flexboxfroggy.com/  
http://cssgridgarden.com/

Then use these as basic ""documentation"" when working:  
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/  
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/  

If that doesn't cut it, dig deeper here:  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout

Then get a clear understanding on media queries which (as far as I know) is the only magic there is to ""responsive design"" if used with flexbox and cssgrid.

Specifically, on CSS, Lynda has a great series called CSS Shorts Weekly. Every week, Chris Converse posts a less on one specific topic. These are usually just 3-12 minutes long, but in each one you can learn a few things that you will be able to use forever.

They also have a ton of comprehensive CSS courses.

In addition, I would say read CSS Tricks, follow leading web developers on Twitter and see what they are sharing every day, and watch presentations from the various web dev conferences.

Here's just a tiny sample of what they have on CSS:

I've noticed some small inconsistencies when switching back and forth (on one of my sites, my link colors change when switching to mobile and then back to desktop). Refreshing always gives me the correct rendering of the page for that view.

As for the ""why"", I couldn't say for sure, but I've always assumed it has something to do with ""on the fly"" re-rendering. When you change views, Chrome is trying to re-interpret in real time several things like the device width, viewport ratio, media queries, priority changes, new device-specific styles, etc. and sometimes doesn't get it exactly right to how the browser would actually render the page on load.

There's probably a specific trigger that's causing it (for example, I ""fixed"" the link color issue by removing an overlapping media query rule), but being that DevTools is just for testing and the likelihood that your actual users are switching views on the fly is slim-to-none, I wouldn't worry too much about it.",1520881151.0

georgeharveybone,"Respectfully disagree with pretty much everyone. Here's my take: https://jsfiddle.net/ooz91q0n/

Don't worry about naming nested components (blocks) according to their parents if you don't have to. Only use elements (the E / __element in BEM) if something is directly a child of a block, for example a list of links. Your logo and nav/menu are in the header, but they aren't really anything to do with the header.

Also a neat tip I recommend is using plural names for wrapper-type divs. For example .icons > .icon. This can really help cut down the amount of names you have to come up with.

Another tip i use, if you use SASS, try and scope every block (the B in BEM) to it's own SASS partial file. It will really help you see the component structure, and as a bonus will set you up for using CSS Modules (which is basically computer-assisted BEM).

Also a final bit of contrary advice, never use @extend in SASS. If you need something similar, just make a mixin and share it around.

Lolnamelol,"As a rule of thumb, you shouldn't go more than 2 levels deep. It just becomes messy.

I would do something like this:

    <div class=""header_navigation"">

      <div class=""header_navigation__icon"">

        <div class=""header_navigation__line--1""></div>

        <div class=""header_navigation__line--2""></div>

        <div class=""header_navigation__line--3""></div>

      </div>

    </div>


Also in your CSS I would extend the header\_navigation__line class like this (you'll need SASS do that, but you can also do it with regular CSS):

    .header_navigation__line
     {
       property: 1;
       propery-2: 2;
     }

    .header_navigation__line--1
      {
       @extend .header_navigation__line;
       new_property: 1;
      }

That will produce this CSS code:

    .header_navigation__line, .header_navigation__line--1 {
      property: 1;
      propery-2: 2;
    }
    .header_navigation__line--1 {
      new_property: 1;
    }

First, nesting makes it a lot easier to tell what my structure is. It's no less than I would do with any code. Second (and probably more controversial) I group on one line attributes that are often related. Positioning and spacing, background and overall appearance, font and text changes, misc.

cauners,"If I understand correctly, you have a DOM element that gets a new class to define its final state. Let's look at two examples (click on the text to toggle final / initial states).    
[Example 1](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/bLXJpa) : transition-duration is defined in the **initial** state. Everything is working as intended.    
[Example 2](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qxewqd) : transition-duration is defined in the **final** state. Now the transition works in the direction initial -> final, but doesn't work in the direction final -> initial.    
This happens, of course, because when the final state is removed, so is the transition-duration property. So in this case (where state transitions can work in both ways) it makes more sense to include the transition-duration in the default, starting state.

binocular_gems,"Good question that should help other people learning as well.

Styles are rules that you can apply to any element on a page to change their appearance.  You can apply those rules in a number of ways, and probably the most common way is to add a class to an element, and then add rules to that *class*.  This allows you to add one class to multiple elements on a page to style them similarly.

The most ""basic"" way to change the appearance is to do what you've started doing:

    <p style=""color: red;"">This text is a paragraph and it will appear red in your browser</p>

But let's say you want to have multiple paragraphs that should appear red, rather than adding a `style=""color: red;""` to every paragraph on your page, it's much easier and scales a lot better to use a class:

    <p class=""alert"">This is a paragraph that will have text that appears red</p>


And then at the top of your document, in the `<head>` section or in an external file called a stylesheet (e.g., a common naming convention is `style.css`), you can define what `.alert` means by adding those same style rules to it  (FYI, the period `.` before the word `alert` indicates that this is a *class* in your stylesheet):

    <style>
        .alert {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>

Now, this way, you'll be able to create multiple paragraphs, add the class `.alert` to them and they'll all appear red.  Best of all?  Let's say in a month you change your mind and want your ""alerts"" to appear green instead of red?  Instead of having to go through and update the inline style on all of your elements, you instead only have to change the one line in your stylesheet from `color: red;` to `color: green;`

You also don't *have* to use classes.  Classes are just one type of selector, out of about ~12 different types (give or take...).  Classes are probably the most common types of selectors for most people starting out.  I'd encourage you to google ""Different types of selectors CSS"" to learn about these.  (this is also a common ""beginner"" front-end dev question on an interview or test... 'Name as many selectors as you can,"")

Starting out, best practice should be to use classes and define those in a `<style>` section of your document, or have another stylesheet.  Of course in web development there are about a thousand ways to skin a cat, but if you're starting out, I'd recommend defining your styles in a stylesheet, and not adding them inline to each element.",1520030485.0

cauners,"This is not related to CSS but JavaScript. In your javascript you have these lines:    


    $('.price').each(function() {
        var this_price = $(this).text();
        var curren = this_price.split(' ')[0];
        var price = this_price.split(' ')[1];

        $(this).text(text);

It basically looks for all elements with a class .price (where you have the ""test word"") and does some price formatting I suppose. ""test word"" is not a valid price, so it gets erased in the process.    

It is also enclosed in document ready function, so the code runs only when the page has loaded - that explains why you can see the text while the website is loading.    

P.S. Answer to the main question - ""how to troubleshoot"" - would be comparing the contents of ""Elements"" tab in developer tools with the source. Elements tab shows that the text is actually missing, not hidden (while it is present in the source) - so it must have been removed at some point. You can see all the live changes that are happening to DOM in the Elements tab, while source only shows the data that's been loaded from server (which can later be modified with javascript, like in this case).",1519740925.0

mvaneijgen,"Posting your code is always better. 

But what I think you should do is add a parent container in which your `.front` and `.back` live in and than add a `:hover`on that parent element which flips the two elements. Right now you have the `:hover` animation on one of the the flip-able elements which causes the hover effect to fire multiple times, because the area on which to `:hover` rotates away from your mouse. To help you debug your issue draw a border around your element and you will see your border will get away from your mouse, when you have a hover effect on a element that does not changes it's borders you will have fixed your issue.

BoDiddySauce,"By adding a blur property to the inner content, it is naturally blurring at the edges, thus allowing the `<body>` content behind it (in this case, the background color) to show. It's just how the spec works there. Imagine having a yellow piece of paper on a table. Then you put a black piece of paper directly on top of it. If you ""blur"" the black piece of paper, its edges become blurred/translucent, and so naturally you start to see the yellow piece of paper beneath it.

How to fix? Add the blur property to the inner contains of `main` or something similar. For example, if you know that all direct children of `main` will be sections, then remove the blur on the `main` el and do something like this: 

`.main > * { filter: blur(6px) }`

s4b3r6,"WordPress ended support for Internet Explorer in 4.8 (June, 2017), so that's the start of your problems.

Your site loads 34 JS scripts, and 18 CSS sheets. That's not excessive for WordPress, but makes the complexity of your site huge. Finding a needle in a haystack is difficult, you need to narrow down what's causing the problem first.

i.e. What errors appear in Internet Explorer's console? (Under Developer Tools)

---

As for your menu, and the text being a link, that isn't something CSS can change.

CSS is just styling.

JS is for interaction, or changing things by responding to other things.

HTML is the markup, and where things like links originally get determined.

WordPress also uses PHP, which spits out the other three, after doing some processing of some data on your server. Most plugins will be PHP.

One button in your menu looks like this:

    <div class=""superknap"">
      <span style=""color: #ffffff;"">
        <a class=""knap"" style=""color: #ffffff;"" href=""https://danime.dk/kundeservice/"" target=""_self"">Kundeservice</a>
      </span>
    </div>

Straight away we can see the link, the a element, only wraps the text, and not the span or the div. If you want the whole button to be the link, then you need to wrap the whole button with the link.

Example:

    <a class=""knap"" style=""color: #ffffff;"" href=""https://danime.dk/kundeservice/"" target=""_self""><div class=""superknap"">
      <span style=""color: #ffffff;"">

Regarding the links on https://danime.dk/kundeservice/om-danime/ you could just make your anchors (<a>) bigger. Make them display: block so they behave like divs and give them some padding.

Also, you probably don't want cursor:cell (since the user isn't really clicking on a cell) and you also probably don't want display: list-item on the .superknap class.

BoDiddySauce,"Much to learn young Skywalker! So I think a big thing you need to learn right from the get-go is the difference between INLINE level elements and BLOCK level elements.

Most elements (including the standard div) are BLOCK.

Elements like span (the inline equivalent of div) and anchor and img, to name a few, are INLINE.

What's the difference? 

BLOCK level elements take up as much space as they can, relative to their parents/containers.

INLINE level elements take up _only the space of their contents_.

This means that, by nature, BLOCK level elements are ""greedy"" and span as much width as they can.

INLINE level elements will only take up the space of their contents. This makes sense when you think of an anchor tag (a standard INLINE element). The anchor tag should ONLY take up the width of its contents (the text that serves as the link). Otherwise, it would be on its own line.

For your second problem, you need to add padding to the ANCHOR tag, not the encompassing div tag: https://screencast.com/t/xEkv14ead

(so, don't add padding to `div.superknap` but rather the anchor tag inside of it)

This will cause the anchor tag to take up all of that space, allowing the user to click anywhere in that area and go to the link. BUT WAIT. INLINE elements can not have TOP/BOTTOM margins/padding due to the very nature of the CSS spec. How do we fix this? Simple! Make the anchor tag a block element! But how? In your CSS! So add a rule like this to your CSS:

```
.superknap a {
    display: block;
}
```

This will coerce the anchor tags inside the `div.superknap` element to behave as if they were block elements, effectively TAKING UP AS MUCH SPACE AS THEY CAN RELATIVE TO THEIR CONTAINER. Along those lines, you should get rid of the useless `span` parent around the anchor tag. It serves literally no purpose. Style the anchor tag with the color and padding. Style the parent div with the other things you've done.

The site CSS Tricks is a great reference for this stuff. Check this out with regard to the inline vs. block (vs. inline-block!) discussion: https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/d/display/

This is a CORE CONCEPT of literally the very foundation of all the building blocks of HTML/the web that you see in EVERY single website. You _must_ learn inline vs. block vs. inline-block right now in order to be able to build even the most basic of layouts, let alone anything remotely complex. 

As I always say, CSS is very easy to pick up, VERY difficult to master. It's its own beast.

ForScale,"I'm not too sure on the first one.. I'd say it depends. If you don't have much that you're show/hiding, then I'd say put it all in right off the bat. On the other hand, if you have a lot that you are dynamically hiding/showing based on data and the like, then you'd probably want to add those elements later/dynamically.

On the second question:

* display - this one affects the render flow on the page; elements with display: none are removed from the flow and will affect other elements.. it's binary (meaning either on or off.. no gradient of values). Can't animate this one.

* opacity - this one leaves the element in the flow and has gradient values (between (inclusive) 0 and 1).. you can animate this one

* visibility - leaves the element in the flow, but doesn't have a gradient of values.. it's either hidden or showing. I don't think you can animate this one, but I might be wrong.",1519412653.0

grasfahrer,"I see someone already helped you with that, but I just want to add something.

Use `visibility: hidden;` and `opacity: 0;` for that kind of situation. That way you can animate the element with a fade effect (`display` doesn't have transitions).

It should work by only setting the opacity to 0, but the user would still be able to interact with the element. Setting the visibility to hidden prevents that behavior.

In order to make the element appear again, just set the visibility to `visible` and the opacity to 1.",1519393877.0

    @media (max-width: 880px) {
      display: none;
    }

on there. So that's why it doesn't show on mobile. That's caused by the class .fl-visible-desktop-medium.

The youtube videos are pretty botched. You included them with an embed code from youtube? They aren't responsive by default. I don't use beaver builder but here is a common trick on how to solve this via css:  

Put a wrapper with a class called something like ""responsive-video"" around each yt embed code and style it like this:

    .responsive-video iframe {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    }
    .responsive-video {
    position: relative;
    padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* Default for 1600x900 videos 16:9 ratio*/
    padding-top: 0px;
    height: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    }
This makes it adapt to the available width with a 16:9 ratio so it doesn't blow up your layout.  
There could be some tricks with beaver builder to solve this differently though.",1519343456.0

Disgruntled__Goat,"I don't see a problem with using breakpoints. Personally I stick to 16px for all sizes as it's plenty big enough for desktop and is the best size for mobile. So like this:

    html {
        font-size: 16px;
    }
    body {
        font-size: 1rem;

Luke-At-UCS,"This is not the completely fluid calc() approach used elsewhere, but it just came up over [on r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7zg7bm/best_way_to_take_a_website_from_pixels_to_rem/). You can set the font-size on the root element (`html`) and change it with a media query. Then set all your type sizes in rems.

    html {
        font-size: 62.5%; /* 10px */
    }
    @media screen and ( min-width: 960px ) {
        html {
            font-size: 78.125%; /* 12.5px */
        }
    }

    body {
        font-size: 1.6rem /* 16px or 20px */
    }

    h1 {
        font-size: 2rem /* 20px or 25px */
    }

This uses percentages for the root size - with 16px being the default for all common browsers - to support individual preferences for different default type sizes. If someone with poor eyesight wants their default at 20px, all the type on your site will be 25% larger.

For IE9 and 10 in particular, you can't use rems on a *font* shorthand, but you *can* use them on a **font-size** property. Because of reasons. They'll also ignore rems on pseudo elements (so keep an eye out for that). You can use postcss to add pixel sizes for each rem-based measurement or write a quick mix-in to do it for you. The PostCSS option is better, but if primarily concerned with font-size, I'd use (in LESS):

    .font-rem( @units ) {
        // 10px is one rem for your given site, set on the html element above
        font-size: @units * 10px;
        font-size: @units * 1rem;
    }
    body {
        .font-rem( 1.6 );
        // comes out as `font-size: 16px; font-size: 1.6rem;`
        // the latter property is ignored by IE9-10 and it falls back to 16px.
    }",1519337652.0
mvaneijgen,"This isn't true. Your animation also transforms the element and there can only be one of the same property on an element. 

It's the same as for example `color:` when you apply the following to an element 
   
    .element {
      color: black;
      color: yellow;
    }

Your element will be the color yellow, because this is the last defined value in your CSS. 

What you could do is stack your transforms in the animation code this will yield the result your are looking for.

As screens get larger, the copy block can move up to the side of the image - to which I'd restrict the maximum width, to preserve quality and proportions based on text volume.

Once the screen gets larger still, that's where I'd split the list into two columns. For example:

https://jsfiddle.net/frownonline/yszr7eu0/

Resize the windows to see how things react. Basically you'll need to judge when a good point to update the layout based on what looks best visually. For example, smaller screens don't warrant a huge margin, so that can be updated at set break points in media queries as suitable, so as screens get larger, more white space is provided by increasing the values.

If you're using the command-line / terminal, you might need to set up your project with some automation tools. This will require you to install Node.js, npm, gulp, gulp-sass, and browserify for live previews, along with some optional tools, and then create a script that tells Gulp what to do - basically, you navigate to your project folder, type 'gulp serve' and it launches; it watches your files for changes, automatically processes your Sass and minifies your code when you save them, outputting them to a 'production' folder and serving it to a browser.

maxxscho,"A little bit off-topic:
I wouldn't use HTML-Tags as your selector at all.
In your search-bar example… when you have to change your button to an anchor tag for any reason, then your (S)CSS doesn't work any more.
I would give any element a class. The [BEM Approach](http://getbem.com/) is a very popular example. You don't have to use this sometimes weird classnames.
If I am building components like your search-bar, I'm doing it this way:

    <div class=""search-bar"">
        <input class=""search-bar-input"" ...>
        <button class=""search-bar-button"" ....></button>
    </div>

And the SCSS looks like this:

    .search-bar {
         // search bar styles

        &-input {
            // styles
        }

        &-button {
            // style
        }
    }

This has 3 benefits for me:

* Everything for my component is in my ""parent"" selector/nesting
* Because of the &-element Selector, I have selectors with only one class in the compiled CSS. Easy to overwrite and no Cascade
* It's perfect to extract every ""component"" into its own file. This is great if you have bigger projects.

This are just my 2 Cents! :)

But generally speaking there is IMHO only 1 important rule for nesting:
Max. 3 levels deep. Otherwise you'll have very specific selectors and you'll have problems, if you want to overwrite something.",1518250889.0

Frypant,"The way I usually introduce scss to developers, they first write css, and after finished with a component, they can simplify it with scss, this way they keep in mind what the end goal is.

Scss nesting can lead to copy html structure in scss, but thats against everything css suposed to do. Some mentioned three deep nesting, one thing to that, try to keep the selector as simple that it fits on a dev tool screen completely, so something between 20-30 lines. If its longer than that, its probably too complicated to understand quickly enough, what lead to errors, and if you work together with others, and supporting the code for longer time, in general its a good idea to make it simple.",1518282427.0

ninjagowoo,"It's probably not a huge deal unless you're nesting a metric ton of styles or nesting very deeply. Remember that everything nested is then prefixed in the resulting generated css. In general this can lead to overly specific selectors and/or unnecessarily long amounts of generated css (which should be compressed/minified anyway). 

If you don't have tooling that automates proper namespace encapsulation for you (the best reasoning for the nesting approach above), you can void generated cruft using a class naming convention like BEM or SMACSS. In your example above, you would name the classes like ""search-container--input"" in the DOM and then use a nested selector for the children eg:

    .search-container {
        &--input {...}      // will result in '.search-container--input {...}
        &--button {...}    // will result in '.search-container--button {...}
    }

this only generates one single classname per element and is less specific. It will also help you think more about utilizing variables and mixins.

jayroger,"Better, non-w3schools link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables

One of the more powerful features of CSS custom properties (or variables) is the use of the cascade. This allows things like:

    button { background-color: var(--button-bg-color, #FF0000); }
    main {
        --button-bg: #00FF00;
    }

    aside {
        --button-bg: #0000FF;
    }

 I.e. buttons are red by default, but green in the main body, except in asides where they are blue. Another example:

    .play-division h1 {
        border-top: 6px solid var(--division-color)
    }

Then set `--division-color` programmatically in the style attribute of each ""play division"" section.

**Parse Errors:** yes you should absolutely fix those. Errors like that could break many things in browsers. You have `color:}` in your CSS - that’s invalid because there should be a colour there eg `color:#000;}`

(Semi colon before the } is technically optional but it’s good practice to put it there.)

**Frameborder attribute:** this doesn’t really matter, it’s just unnecessary in modern browsers. The replacement would be `style=""border:0""` but frameborder still works in all browsers.

Generally if the syntax of the HTML is correct - `attr=""value""` - it doesn’t matter what the attribute or value is. There are lots of things that were invalid at one time like `target=""_blank""` but are useful.

**For attribute:** this attribute should point to a valid element, ie something with `id=""wpforms-136-field_6""`. It means that you can focus the form field by clicking the label. Helps for accessibility too. Should be fixed if possible but not the end of the world. ",1518017934.0

cauners,"You have actually created 4 boxes that are inside each other: table > tr > td > a. Right now you can see only the <a> box, because you have set background and border for it. So changing the size of <td> won't directly affect the size of <a>.    
You can do any of the following:    
* Change the size of <a> with padding and/or width (you'll have to make the <a> a block level element though by display:inline-block);    
* Make the <a> occupy all available space of <td>, by making its width 100%.    
",1517836147.0
zhormine,"There are many ways to do so, but in your case if you want to follow that path you should :
- Declare your <a> as a block with ""display:block;""
- Declare a dimension for your <a>. Right now, you put 200px of width for its parent element <td>, so you should put ""width:100%;"" and ""height:100%;"". So, you are saying ""put my element (<a>) at a % relative to its parent element (<td>). 
- Declare a height for your <td> so that your <a> will take a width of 100% of 200px, then a height of 100% of your desired height.

By adding a specific height to your <td>, a relative dimension and a display:block; for your <a>, it has to work. Otherwise, you could simply put a specific height to your <a> and set it to display:block;

Mojitane,"Maybe try sketching your idea on paper and think about what elements need classes.   
On first glance there are a number of problems like every single anchor tag you have in your mobile menu has ""position: absolute"" set.  
Just removing that in your css makes it kinda work: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MQyBMQ

I've had that problem where I got confused with what elements need to be fixed / absolute / relative positioned etc. In those cases sketching it or (if it's not too much code) cleanly rewriting it from scratch is the best thing to do.

chaines51,"For what it's worth, your subreddit link doesn't seem to be working. Never created a subreddit, but maybe you have to publish it before anyone else can see it?

EDIT: To try to answer your questions. You can get rid of the dark overlay, and change the height in the `#header` section of the stylesheet:

We changed the `height` property to `min-height`, which allows the header to grow with the size of the header image. Your 585px tall image is probably gonna be too tall, so you can set a `max-height` property, or simply change the `min-height` back to a height and pick a number that you think works
Also, remove the `linear-gradient` from the `background-image` property, keeping the `url`, so that the whole block looks like this:


    #header
    {
    	-webkit-order:-1;
    	-ms-flex-order:-1;
    	order:-1;
    	margin:60px 30px 0;
    	width:100%;
    	min-height:160px;
    	border:0;
    	background-color:#323a47;
    	background-image:url(%%header%%);
    	background-position:center top;
    	background-size:cover
    }

Doing so is going to make the bar at the bottom significantly more faded though, so your best bet is probably to increase that a bit, by changing the `#header:after` block to look like this:

    #header:after
    {
    	position:absolute;
    	z-index:-1;
    	left:0;
    	bottom:0;
    	width:100%;

https://codepen.io/anon/pen/EQYWvL

This uses a container which has overflow hidden to clip things outside of it, then a square is made inside of it, then rotated 45 degrees and moved down to make a triangle when the bottom is clipped off. If a click event is bound to the link it should work, but if you want to do things like scale or resize the triangle, I think you're better off with the SVG. But I just wanted to show that this can be done with minimal markup and just a little CSS.

I used a link as the clickable element, but it would also work with a div or another element.  I thought about using just one div an a ::before or ::after pseudo element, but then the clickable area is just the div itself which isn't what you're going for.",1517096809.0

ajkandy,"Yes, you can use ```min-height``` on the headline element to make sure it always takes up the same vertical space, regardless of how long the content is. 

Of course, this presumes your headline texts will always fit within the number of lines you specify, which is a content issue - not always true if text is translated to, say, French or German.

Rough demo here: https://codepen.io/ajkandy/pen/eVYKVP

It applies a min-height of 2.5em to the h1 element, so it's always equal to about 2.5x its letter height. Adds 0.5em padding-bottom for spacing. Then, the paragraph starts right after that ends, so they will always line up. 

(Edit) The first two are standard h1 and p tags using floats, the bottom two pairs are a CSS Grid context using ```minmax``` to set row heights; they'll have a default minimum height, and automatically resize to match content. The paragraphs start in the next row, so they'll match start points by default. Note, if you resize the window, that the Grid versions stay aligned, whereas the floated versions don't.",1517257432.0

MrZiles,"I guess you mean @media queries for changing the styling when the window size is smaller? This is called responsive design and is used to make a webpage that works on both desktop and mobile devices, as you can make css tweaks for when the screen size gets smaller and things start to look off.

    @media screen and (max-width:480px) {
        .container-class-name {
            display: block;
            margin: 20px auto;
        }
    }

Just an example of doing something with a media query. I usually keep dev tools in Chrome open and slowly size down to see the dimensions of the window for when it starts to look funky. Note that media queries are in that category of ""easy to use, difficult to master,"" as they do change how you should go about styling the initial page -- ideally you want to make it easier on yourself by only requiring a few changes.

If you don't, you end up with lots of media queries that are difficult to maintain, like this:

    @media screen and (max-width:480px) {
        .container-class-name-desktop {
            display: none;
        }
        .container-class-name-mobile {
            display: block;
        }
    }

...which, I mean, you _can_ do, but it does get unwieldy to maintain and I wouldn't recommend unless you absolutely have no choice but to do.

At least knowing the terms ""media query"" and ""responsive design"" might be a big help for looking up tips.

lamb_pudding,"[Is this](https://codepen.io/sscooba/pen/PEybRK?editors=0010) what you were attempting to do? I added code on line 48. What I added was a [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame). In this instance a `setTimeout` would have also worked. What was happening was all the `setupPositions`, including the CSS stuff, was was *potentially* happening on 1 draw frame. So on the same frame you set the new positions you also said it can animate. The reason I said potentially was because in your current code you have no control over the draw frame. Javascript will attempt to do all that on 1 frame however if your code was more complicated it could potentially hold up frame rendering and have unexpected results that differ from your first example. Here is a very basic version of what was occurring in your code:

- Page starts loading and drawing
- Frame 1 draws and renders clock
- Javascript sets the clock positions and the transition property
- Frame 2 draws and animates the hands to their starting position

After my edit this is what was occurring:

- Page starts loading and drawing
- Frame 1 draws and renders clock
- Javascript sets the clock positions
- Frame 2 draws the hands to their starting position
- Javascript sets transition property
- Frame 3 will now have clock animate to any new properties.

One last thing, in general any CSS changes happening in Javascript, even class name changes, should occur inside a `requestAnimationFrame`. The reason why is the browser can better manage it's draw cycles and draw your stuff more smoothly. I am giving a super basic summary of what it actually does so definitely google `requestAnimationFrame` a bit. It is a very valuable thing in JS.",1516160965.0

I agree with /u/icantthinkofone has said that you shouldn't be using it for layout, but knowing _how_ it can be used will give you some great knowledge, especially if you're debugging legacy sites. Floats do have a place CSS, like if you want to align an image in a block of text.

Position is a must, you have to understand the relationship between relative and absolute, and also the dreaded z-index. It's a great tool to have; it can be confusing at first but great for pinning elements.

Inline, inline-block, block, all display declarations, these are really good to know for managing content blocks.

If you want to go hardcore, then learn how display: table | table-row | table cell works. You shouldn't really need to know this but, there was a time when complex layouts were relying on these sorts of declarations.

zork-tdmog,"> Grid Layout is a new layout model for CSS that has powerful abilities to control the sizing and positioning of boxes and their contents. Unlike Flexible Box Layout, which is single-axis–oriented, Grid Layout is optimized for 2-dimensional layouts: those in which alignment of content is desired in both dimensions.

Use CSS Grid for layouts that span over more that one row or column.

Use CSS Flexbox for items that span one row or column.

Values can be inherited from parents. Figure out which ones are and leverage that.

Understanding structure takes time. Getting to the point where you can make a 'pixel perfect' result takes a lot of time, especially with responsive layouts. 

If you identify that there's something you don't understand, investigate it good. Take `line-height` for example: 
      
- does it operate differently on different display types?
- does it impact layout? 
- is it inherited?
- what is the range of values/value types it can take?
- can you identify cross browser inconsistencies?

Whenever you come across a situation where you have unexpected results, investigate it. Only then can you identify the problem and learn how to better approach. Be meticulous in your learning.

_alright_then_,"First off, would like to say that your class naming is extremely weird and confusing.

Why does the nav have the class `cl-effect-5`. And then you give the `<a>` tags the same class?

and then in the css you access the `<a>` class with `.cl-effect-5 a`

This would be much clearer and easier with all classes. So in my pen i changed all the classes around. 

SIDE NOTE: It's generally better to give everything classes and access the elements with classes and not with things as `div{}, a{}` etc.

Using classes will make this whole thing more easier for you. I gave the `span` 1 class. `nav__span`. And then for different colors I gave them all another class such as `.nav__span--red`

Using [BEM](http://getbem.com/) for this is easier. That means using the double underscore and double dash. In this case the double underscore means it's a seperate element. And the double dash is called a modifier. 

the CSS got a bit longer (for every color) but overal it's much clearer.

ajkandy,"I think what is happening in the original sample image is a lot simpler, and doesn’t involve css gradients or background-clip. 

I think the text string is being manipulated by JS like this: 

* Create an array of desired colour stop RGB values (the gradient)
* Calculate the total length of the string
* Divide the array colour stops evenly to points in the string
* Count the letter steps between stops
* Calculate the individual blend values for each letter step between stops
* Iterate over the string with a for loop, setting each letter to its appropriate colour via the style.color attribute. 

This way, the gradient will evenly run over the length of the text, regardless of font size, browser zoom or string length, although the number of stops may need to be adjusted to produce a pleasing effect. 

In theory you could use line break detection to end the loop and start a different one, or assign specific gradients anywhere with IDs or classes. ",1514675129.0

So your text shows the background image, and the image is designed as stripes of the different horizontal gradients. I don't think this will be possible with reponsively-sized text, so just set all your sizes for your text in pixels, and then set the background-size to match.

sitefall,"1.) Because they are inline elements.  If you want to fix this you can either set the parent containers font size to 0, then set the individual children elements back to the font size you want (kind of hacky solution if you ask me) but here is an [example](https://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/).  Or just you know, make them block or inline-block.  Why is this the case?  I guess because inline elements should be just that, in-line with the text - this kind of requires some space/margin around it so it doesn't just get clumped in with the fonts.

2.) Yes, sure.  You need to use css transition property.  Depends a lot on how the menu is setup, and you can't really animate something from display:none; to display: block; for example, but you can slide it behind other elements, change it's size, put it in a container and swing that out, etc.  Many methods that would take hours of explanation.  I suggest you look into CSS drop down menu tutorials, there are many.  Javascript works as well, but isn't really ""needed"" if you plan it out correctly.  It will be easier with JS, but not faster and more efficient running in the browser, and it's such a simple thing, I usually just use CSS so that navigation isn't effected by a client that has JS disabled in the browser (though this is rare these days).

3.) Maybe start with a simplified menu, just one thing with a drop down, then expand it from there.  I refer to my suggestion in #2 to check tutorials for this.  It's a lot to explain.  Menus are things people typically struggle with in CSS.

4.) .class0 .class1 will select any element with class ""class1"" inside a parent with class ""class0"":

    <div class=""class0"">
        <div class=""class1"">This will be selected</div>
        <div class=""other stuff"">
            <div class=""class1"">This will also be selected</div>
        </div>
    </div>

and .class0.class1 selects an element with BOTH classes, like this:

    <div class=""class0""></div>
    <div class=""class1""></div>
    <div class=""class0 class1"">This will be selected</div>



But I think you mean .class0, .class1 which will select both of those, like this:

    .class0, .class1{
        /*some styles*/
    }

    <div class=""class0"">this will be selected</div>
    <div class=""class1"">this will be selected</div>

In an [article](https://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/07/04/is-it-really-safe-to-start-using-css-grid-layout/) from this July, she talked about how Grid works in enough browsers (some 70% now) that it's okay to use it, with some very basic fallbacks for older browsers so that the website isn't completely broken. Grid was only released this spring, while Flexbox is much older.

On that particular subject, under IE11 I like to add a big fat banner to change browsers.

So, apart from some shenanigans of Edge on some specific scenarios, instead of asking people to use latest Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, or whatever browser you may think, it's better to check with [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) if the features you need are supported and polyfill them or just lock the user with a ""Upgrade your browser"" link [like here](http://outdatedbrowser.com).

Of course, **it always depends on your target**. If you need to support devices that may be never be upgraded, like it happens on **medium-to-large business** due to the **long lifecycle** systems have and the **inability to upgrade or change browsers**, then you are almost grounded to support them with old BUT reliable techniques: evading JS for only specific reasons, always using SSR, design around Desktop-first experience, using minimal footprint (CSS/JS) to avoid the browser eating memory or hanging up, etc. For me, that means trading nuances for adding some zeroes to the paycheck.

This effect would be quite difficult to achieve with the animation in steps, as it effectively morphs steps between the start and end position. Which, in the example is easy to do because the y-coordinates don't change (the image sequence is in one line).  In the `walk-east` keyframes you can see it only animates the background-position in one dimension.

To complete the animation I'd suggest using a graphics program to move all the images on one line. Definitely the quickest way.

I'm not even 100% sure you could complete this animation using steps in CSS, at least you'd be spending quite some time specifying at what ercentages the intermediate steps would have to be, because you'll have to move the background-image both sideways and up/down, which would likely result in the animation slowly moving in a diagonal line.

dyldog,"You can switch out your term “CSS page” for “stylesheet”. One CSS file is referred to as a stylesheet, and you’re asking if it’s best to have one or multiple stylesheets.

There are pros and cons to both approaches. 

If you have a single stylesheet that has the CSS for the homepage and all the project pages, visitors only have to load one file. There’s only one HTTP request. When they view a project page after the homepage, it will load more quickly because they’ve already downloaded the CSS for it. However, the download of the initial CSS file (and therefore the initial load of the homepage) will take a bit longer. 

The opposite is true if you include page-specific stylesheets. The initial homepage load will be a bit quicker, but the other pages will have more HTTP requests and take a bit longer to load as visitors will have to download unique stylesheets for those pages.

You’ll see both approaches in the wild and they can each be valid depending on context. 

My recommendation would be to always use a single stylesheet when possible. If your project pages share some of the CSS from your homepage, use one file — especially if the styles specific to the project pages isn’t very long.

However, if your project pages are completely customised and unique to your homepage (and each other), consider treating them as separate websites and having a CSS file for each one.",1513721145.0

I wouldn't worry about breaking your CSS file up until it exceeds 2MB.

On the other hand, breaking it up for organizational purposes is a great idea as long as you use some tool to compile it back to a single file in production. It's important to put it back in one file (when you are not in development) because each file is a separate HTTP request.

Your point is that the second example is more succinct because it's physically less characters, where I say the top example is better because it's more readable.

And the difference isn't ""negligable"". The top example, multiplied by the size of an entire application, is a lot more maintainable.

Say you want the font or style of the ""28"" on the first card when you scroll down.  Right click on the 28 and select inspect.  Something will be highligted in the html.  It might be the text ""28"", but it might also be a container div or something.  If there's an arrow on the highlighted line for a drop down, click it.  Highlight each line of code in there until you find the text associated with what you want the style of.  Click that line.

Now on the right pane in the dev tools, it will show the CSS.  From the top to the bottom, scan down the list looking for the ""font-family"" (or whatever style attribute you're looking for).  The first one from the top is the one you want.  If it says ""inheret"" then keep scanning down the list until you find one that has a set property.

Click the ""sources"" tab at the top of the devtools panel.  On the list of sources you will see something loading from fonts.google.com (or whatever thing you are looking for).  Click that to expand the list, and you will see something like:

`css?family=Lato:300,400,700%7COld+Standard+TT:400,400italic&subset=latin`

Looking closely you can see all the fonts used there in the url.

RoToRa,"I'm not sure what you are asking. You can do what ever you want, als long you obide by the standards of CSS (and the ablities of browsers).

You can use percentages for margins, however they are based on the **width** of the parent element, never the height, even for top and bottom margin.

Also, margin is not really for ""positioning"" elements in the sense of CSS, but just defines the ""gaps"" between elements. 

So do you want the top half (= 100px) of the parent element to be an empty gap, then, yes,  `margin-top: 100px` would be one of many correct ways to do it.

If that's not what you want, you'll need to discribe it better, for example with a drawing.

There is the concept of ""relative positioning"" in CSS, but that probably not what you want. What you may could use is ""absolute postioning relative to a parent element"", but ""absolute positioning"" is tricky and if it's the right tool here is difficult to say without more information.

EDIT: it is a CSS property, it just doesn't work this way

Set your HTML/body to height:100%

add a wrapper div around your table, set that to 100% aswell. 

remove the top: and margin: auto; property from your table.

set the wrapper to 

    display:flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;

this will center it vertically and horizontally.


Little tip: you don't need to use

    position: relative; 

that much, usually only when you also use a 

    position: absolute;

somewhere


another ps:

    padding-left: 200px;
    padding-right: 200px;

is the same as:

    padding: 0 200px;

Inline CSS is beneficial for applying styles to the very first thing the user sees as they visit a website; you skip having to wait for the styles to download before seeing something meaningful, and the rest of the styles should simply download as normal in the background. Note, however, that the modern way to do this is not using inline styles, but using HTTP/2 Push (though this is a bit of a pain to setup properly as it is today, depending on your deployment methods...).

However, as a means of organizing - don't do it.

Last year we rewrote our entire CSS from standard cascading to use BEM for this exact reason. It's not about the number of selectors, it's about selector depth. One of the most expensive selectors is, believe it or not, the descendent selector (`.class1 .class2 {}`). When you have as much code as we do, selector depth is a real thing. I hated the idea of switching to BEM (hated hated hated) but it did create a convention for the entire web team to use and reduced selector depth to 0 almost across the board, which did have tangible site speed gains.

Yes that’s entirely the point. Everything should be aligned to the same grid. You can’t have 4 columns in a row then 5 columns underneath it then 7 columns under that. 

They also miss the point of Bootstrap as a framework, which is its *composability*. You have a small set of classes and you can fit them together in many different ways on different pages. With CSS Grid you need to write a separate stylesheet for every page/section. So I don’t buy the point about simpler code.
