It is possible you would have to alter the source template file for that display if it is possible, to embed new internal styles, versus trying to edit the actual content in HTML mode which strips CSS tags.

Alternatively, see if you can track down the CSS source file that includes the ""xl65"" ... ""xl76"" styles. If you can and are able to edit that file, this is where you should be inserting the CSS to alternate table row colors.

If you had any way to include custom JavaScript within the source code it could be achieved that way as well. But I suspect if it is rejecting CSS it will also reject <script> tags.

If the table rows and content ever change, you'll find that manually adding the alternating colors will prove to be a real maintenance pain down the road as you'll have to redo it if any rows ever get removed or rearranged.",1543438186.0

JGreatorex,"Hi eightboy!

Firstly, as Flerex mentioned - this isn't correct usage for a table, tables should only be used for data.

Secondly, if you do want to go down this approach of using the table for structure (which I very much wouldn't), I recommend you read up on tables and how they work. You're using a `<th>` element to contain everything which is for table headers / col titles. For this usage I'd say use a `<td>`  which stands for table data.

I believe it would be useful for you to post the full HTML + CSS as when trying to reproducing this in [https://codepen.io/JGreatorex/pen/YROzBR?editors=1100](codepen) I can't seem to get your issue.

If you could use JSFiddle or alike to host your code so we can help that'd be great.

But once again I highly recommend you do more research into properly structure a HTML page, the only real reason you'd use a table for the page structure is in HTML emails.

cyancey76,"Iframes aren’t bad across the board. Their reputation has just been tainted by inappropriate usage (such as embedding a whole external webpage in yours instead of using an API for the content).

The upside to using them is that they are user and provider friendly. The content provider still has control of the scripts you are including and you as the developer have very little work to do to actually get it working. 

If the sites give you iframe markup to use for an embed as a first solution then that is their preferred way and it’s acceptable usage. 

Unfortunately, a lot of the time there is not going to be 1 best and only way of doing things on the web. A lot of the time being a developer means having to understand your multiple options (cutting edge and not so cutting edge too) so you can weigh your requirements versus limitations on each unique project.",1543299697.0

tastycat,"That's not how a style tag works, or how inline styles work.

You may have meant something like:

    <p class=""title"" style=""color: red;"">This is a test Hoi Test test est</p>

That's how inline styles work, but it's not a best practice.  I think you were actually trying for something like this:

    <html>
        <head>
            <title>This is a test</title>
            <style>
                p {
                  color: red;
                }
            </style>

        <body>
            <p>Test test test</p>
        </body>
    </html>

That's how the `style` tag works.

You can also use a `link` tag to include CSS external to your HTML file - that's more than I want to get into, but the MDN is a good reference and has a good example of including CSS in this way on [their page about the `link` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link).",1543292276.0

Killed_Mufasa,"The thing you would normally need is background-repeat: no-repeat, but it [doesn't work on IE6](https://caniuse.com/#feat=background-repeat-round-space).. You could also try background-size: cover, but guess what  [that won't work either..](https://caniuse.com/#search=background-siz)

So let's think outside the box.. Absolute positioned image with width: 100vw and heigth: 100vh? [Lol nope](https://caniuse.com/#search=view). And you [can't even make it fixed](https://caniuse.com/#search=view).

I think your best option is something like this:

    <body>
    <img src=""idk"" class=""background/>
    <!--other stuff-->
    </body>
    
    body, html {height:100%; width:100%}
    .background {position: absolute; height:100%; width: 100%;}

dudeelec,"SOLVED!

Thanks to all your links, I found
""how to position text over image"" on w3schools.com

The background pic is placed in the container as img without style width 100%
This will lock the image to its px size and absolute position if I wish to.

I then placed each java applet inside a div, and position them with absolute position.

Looks Allright in most resolutions, but I have to keep in mind the screens have to be at least the size of the picture, or I will have to scroll.
With 1024x768 that shouldn't be a problem. My bug was the picture repeating itself all over the place.

rubywahoo,"You could do this with CSS if you put your to-be-revealed content inside of a div, and nest that div inside of the element containing your link. Also, change your current span to a div. I’m on mobile, but it would look like this:

    <div id=“entry01”>entry01
         <div id=“reveal01”>all of the content...</div>
    </div>

Then your css would be:

    #reveal01 { display: none; }

    #entry01:hover #reveal01 { display: block; }

You can then use other css rules to make reveal01 look however you want. Or use visibility: hidden and visibility: visible instead of display

cometakethemcommies,"A few things

>Does it need to be in .html?

If so you could put together a python script where you input your parameters and have it generate the .html file for you. **This is overkill btw** but can be a very easy and powerful way to achieve this with next to no effort (after the hard parts of setting up and writing the script of course)

>Can it be a .pdf?

If you're only wanting .html invoices because you want to host it online, you could just use a .pdf file and that'll view online just fine.

With this method you would need to make a *fillable pdf* with your invoice all typed up and *form boxes* where you want to add information. After you've entered your information, just print the .pdf and select something along the lines 'save as pdf' which will save a flattened uneditable version of that .pdf which you can then host

<h1>My Midterm Page</h1>



<p>The year is 1995. Deep in South Africa, 200km north of Garzburg, Outer Heaven-

an armed fortress nation, established by the legendary mercenary. He was

feared in combat by both his friends and foes as a hero and a lunatic. The

""Western"" nations have found that a weapon of mas destruction capable of

rewritting war history is under development at Outer Heaven. They have called

upon the high-tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND to take care of the

situation.  In response to this order, Big Boss, the commander-in-chief of

FOX-HOUND, sent Gray Fox, the man with the code name ""Fox"" which is given to

the best member of the unit ""Operation intrude N313""</p>



<img src=""images/Metal.png"" alt>



<p>After a few days, his last message being ""Metal Gear..."" Gray Fox was missing

in action. Taking the situation seriously, the top men of the ""West"" again

called for FOX-HOUND. Big Boss selected Solid Snake, who had recently joined

FOX-HOUND, as the agent and entrusted everything to him.

Successfully making a solo infiltration to Outer Heaven, Snake got in touch

with local resistance members Schneider, Diane and Jennifer. With their

co-operation, Snake suceeded in rescueing Gray Fox. Gray Fox laid out the

terrifying facts about ""Metal Gear"" Metal Gear was the development name of a

nuclear warhead-equiped two-legged walking tank. It can walk through over the

toughtest terrains that would stop normal tanks. It can conduct local warfare

by itself with unique weapons like its vulcan-cannon and anti-tank missiles.

It was indeed a new type of weapon that can conduct a nuclear attack against

any place on the face of the Earth from any l and surface...</p>

&#x200B;

<p>With Metal Gear, Outer Heaven was trying to establish its military superiority

over the entire world. In order to destroy Metal Gear, Snake rescued Metal

Gear's chief engineer Dr. Pettrovich and his daughter, Elen, who was taken

hostage to force her father to continue with his development. Snake hears from

Dr. Pettrovich how to destroy Metal Gear. However, as Snake approached the heart of Outer Heaven and Metal Gear, well

designed traps are set all around Snake- as if his actions are being leaked

to the enemy... In the midst of the escalating battle, the leader of the resistance,

Schneider, fell into the hands of the enemy, and Snake himself was injured

through the deadly battles with Outer Heaven's best mercenaries. But Snakes

indomitable spirit lead him to the 100th floor basement of the secret base

where Metal Gear was developed. Evading the powerful defense system that wipes

out all intruders, Snake ultimately succeeded in destroying Metal Gear.</p>

frownonline,"You need to read up on html structure as there some invalid nesting going on there.

As you've not given info on the brief that you're working to, given the appearance, I've done a version of how I'd approach it here:

https://jsfiddle.net/frownonline/4yknLfdx/

This is responsive and valid [albeit a very simple structure], which uses semantic markup for structure. There are horizontal rules in there, hidden by default, but can prove invaluable when creating a print stylesheet and are also useful for separation should CSS be disabled [user preference / corrupted stylesheet etc].

I've also used standard anchor tags for the links - there's no benefit to using inline JS, unless your brief specifies it?

You'll also note the change in header level - there should only be on h1 per page [yes, HTML5 allows use of multiple, but that completely defies the point of a primary heading...]. For semantics, as there is a number of links, as per the navigation, you can structure these by using a list here - I've used ordered here [which can be useful for referencing a specific bullet e.g. point 7 on a long list of search results] depending on its usage.

The though is, if you disable your styles, is the page content still useable, can a screen reader scan through it logically and clearly for accessibility? I'm aware you're new to this, but there's a lotto learn and you may as well start now!

Let me know if there's any other clarification you need. I'll help out as much as I can - as I'm sure other fine folk on here will do. Good luck!",1541169254.0

user9713,"Side note (I'm mentioning this because it took me longer than it should have to debug why a style wasn't applying):

`id` has a higher specificity than `class`, so if you try to apply a property to an element that has `id` using another `class`--that already has the property set on in its `id` declaration in CSS--the new class style won't apply.

BTW, if anyone reading this has a good reference guide on specificity, I'd appreciate it. Some of the rules I've learned are:

`id` > `class`

tentaclebreath,Used to be ID was used for elements that only had a single instance (example headers) on the page whereas CLASS could be used on many elements (example images).

&#x200B;

A class is intended to be non-unique, and repeated on any page any number of times. 

&#x200B;

Ids used to be much more prevalent as they made it easy to reference a specific element within javascript code using the getElementById() method.  For example, it would be common to see <input name='age' id='age-input'>.  Since the rise of modern javascript frameworks such as angular and vue, i've not seen much use of ids anymore, and you can probably plan to stick to classes unless you find some special cases dictating an id makes sense. 

&#x200B;

Classes tend to be most useful and meaningful when they describe specific css rules which they can be used to apply. Some good examples are 'bold', 'is-success', and 'is-text-brown'.",1540654828.0

To style your elements, you should use CSS, if you haven't learn about it yet, you can style use properties on your html tags like you did, but the right one is ``style=""...""``.  
You still need to use ``;`` **inside** the style property, see below for an example, or some others properties (Javascript properties, but that's not the subject here).

If you want to make text appear bold, you can use the ``<b>Text</b>`` tag, or use ``style=""font-weight: bold;""``, so your line with the 1 is:

    <th rowspan=""3"" style=""font-weight: bold;background-color: #ffff3d;"">1</th>

I had a similar problem to that once, but the browser I was using at the time just wouldn't render it bold/italic without a proper bold or italic face available.",1540419259.0

weasel85,"No, unfortunately HTML doesn't have variables. Variables are a part of a programming language, and HTML is just a markup language.

There are a few solutions though. If your web server allows for PHP, you can use PHP's [require( ) function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.require.php) and include the header from there. You can also do this via [jQuery's load( ) method](http://api.jquery.com/load/). The PHP option is better, though, because PHP is processed on the web server and is search engine friendly, whereas jQuery's load( ) method [isn't really](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3693244/jquery-load-and-seo-anyone-got-a-decent-answer).

If your web server is set up for it, the old [server side includes](https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/sitemanagement/includes.html) way of doing things might still work. It requires that your file is named with the .shtml extension instead of the normal .html one. When I first started web dev, that's how I wrote a number of my sites. But I don't know how well it works for search engine crawling. I haven't used SSI in years.",1540393821.0

Thykka,"As others have mentioned, you'll need to use a server-side language for this.

...except if you just want a quick, dirty and an unwieldy way; [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe)


    <iframe src=""header.html""></iframe>

This will create an element, which loads another html document inside of the element.

There are some issues though; a page built from iframe elements makes the browser consume more memory and processing power. Furthermore, an iframe'd page is an entire sandboxed web page of it's own, and there might be issues making it work together with it's host page.

Another way would be to have a single html file that acts as a template, into which the contents are loaded via JavaScript. Here's a [basic example](https://github.com/mdn/fetch-examples/tree/master/fetch-text) of that. While this can be useful in many cases, there are caveats… If the user doesn't have javascript enabled, they won't be able to use such a site. This also applies on some (most?) search crawlers, causing your pages to be missing from Google, etc. There are way's around this, which require some server-side scripting...

lamb_pudding,"One tip I would give, regardless if you write plain HTML/CSS/JS or a Wordpress theme, is to pick up how to use git. Once you learn it and adopt it into your work flow it becomes invaluable. Git gives you version history in your code.

> If I'd start myself of in this business, what's the way websites are created nowadays? 

There are lots of ways to create websites. It depends on the scope of the project. If it's a static website (like a portfolio or a landing page) you can get away with just HTML/CSS/JS. 

If they require some dynamic elements with a data store, that's when you could use some sort of framework (PHP and Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Python and Django, JavaScript and Node, etc...).

> Are developers still writing plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript or they go ahead and use WordPress or pre-created libraries?

Like I said, both. If they go the CMS route, WordPress and Craft are two popular frameworks.

> Since I'm a student, what would be ""optimal"" price mark for my work?

Your student status is simultaneously your strength and your weakness. Being a student means you don't have the experience, and that will raise red flags for potential clients. You'll have to make up for that with skills and acumen and a faster learning curve than others (i.e. you need to prove you can work harder than anyone else). 

That said, by being a student with low expenses, you're also able to price yourself very competitively. Just realize that once you start a race to the bottom in terms of prices, you're competing with people internationally who have more experience and are making a higher margin on say $25-50/hr because they live in a country where that goes a lot further than the US.",1539909490.0

- Html and CSS make sense, but why events? Random. I know you have a JS app. 
- Did you go to various subs or sites to gather questions, or was it just your team? If just your team, do you give any details about how you came up with the questions?  
- Were the answers provided per reviewed?  
- How will users know if the questions or answers are still valid in 1+ months?   
- Are the questions categorized, or are they random? Meaning, if I want to prep for html lists, can i jump just to those?

Add a main menu where to choose the course and you should make your app update by checking content online

You have a local form and then whenever you're online, check if the content has been updated. So you can download without updating the app each time

Your biggest issue is likely the CSS that you've placed in the <head>. Many email clients completely ignore code in the <head>, so you can't put CSS there reliably.

It is likely that your forwarding issue has to do with the fact that your <head> is being completely ignored when the email is forwarded. You can *try* simply moving that style code into the <body> before the table, but still some email clients ignore <style> tags.

tastycat,"The W3C Validator is a very powerful tool and each error is explained clearly given that you have the prerequisite web dev knowledge to understand it, so it's probably worth working through those errors... but there are a lot of issues and that leads me to believe that you don't have the requisite knowledge to understand those errors, so here's the things I noticed.

1. `html` -  A html page has an optional doctype, then an `html` tag which contains everything else.  Your `html` tag is inside a `div`, which isn't allowed.

2. `head` - the `head` tag should only contain non-display elements that should be loaded prior to the content of the website. `title`, `meta`, `link`, and `script` tags are often found here.  The `h1` tag you have there is invalid.

3. `body` - the `html` tag should only have two children: `head` and `body`.  Your `body` tag is wrapped in another unnecessary `div`.

1. `nav` - Kind of minor but you shouldn't have spaces in filenames.  It can work, but you shouldn't expect it to always work.  Use underscores or dashes instead.

1. `footer` - Your `footer` tag is also wrapped in an unnecessary `div`.  Semantic elements such as `header`, `footer`, `section`, `article`, and `nav` exist primarily to describe the intended purpose of the content of that block of code/content (e.g. `nav` is a navigation block, etc.) but they all act like a `div` for development purposes, so there's no need to wrap a `footer` in a `div` unless you have specific needs (for styling or something).

All in all, it should look something more like this:

If you serve the same resource (html, js, css, etc) multiple times with the same etag, the browser knows it can rely on its cached data for that resource. If you then serve a new etag for an already cached resource, the browser knows it needs to load the resource and not rely on the cache.

A simple method is to have the etag be relative to either the version or last modified date. As long as this is updated whenever a change is made, you can rely on the browser to manage the cache for you.

cyancey76,"CSS is cascading for the entire page. All the css you include, the browser will try apply to the whole page.

What you are wanting to do is actually accomplished by using more specific selectors in your css. You can still separate the styles into a header.css and container.css but what you need to do to ""turn it on and off"" is to something like this:

Make sure the header HTML has a unique class or id on the top-level element (ex. <header id=""site-header"">). Do the same for your container (ex. <main id=""site-container"">). Then in your css make sure all your selectors start with ""#site-header"" or ""#site-container"" so that they are specific to only that part of the page.

No, this is not the ""right"" way to do it but it accomplishes what you are asking (it's actually pretty bad practice). The gist of it is, all the styles are going to be combined into 1 virtual stylesheet by the browser and so you have to limit selectors so that when the renderer gets to the container content it just skips over the styles you don't need.

cyancey76,"When you set position as fixed or absolute it takes the element out of the document flow. All the other elements now don't care where it is and will move to fill its spot.

The easiest way to deal with this is to add a top margin to the next sibling element after, in this case your <section>. The margin should be the height of the element (try ""margin: 100px auto 0;"").

If that isn't an option, do you have to log in to view the source image?                   
You can check by opening a private browser window and entering the direct link to the image. If you can't view the images without being logged in, try using something like Selenium to automate downloading images.

If you can save the image without logging in you need to do two things, first is to collect a list of the images for the book. Second is to actually save the images on your computer.                   

You can write a few javascript lines to flip through the pages, try flipping through the first 10 pages. You basically want to ""click"" the little blue arrow at the bottom of the screen 10 times. Try to write a script to do that and add a way to save the image link in order. You can just keep a list of image links.

* `<center>` is marked as 'obsolete' and should be avoided. It is recommended to use CSS with `text-align: center;` on the parent. 
* HTML attributes should be lower case, so 'id' instead of 'Id'.
* Generally when you start writing the same thing more than once there's likely a better way to do it. Notice how you keep getting the title element by getElementById. Below is a simplified way to refer to and manipulate DOM elements.
* I also changed your two if statements to an if/else for simplicity.

jpwall,"I recently had to work on a similar project at my summer job. I used Node, which I think is a very straightforward solution to this issue. Basically, I used the built in express web server to handle the GET request to the login page. That login page used a POST request back to the server with the login information. If the login username and password matched, then it checked the password after reading the hash from the PostgreSQL database using Bcrypt. Next, it sent back a cookie for the user to keep. When a user creates an account, it is saved as a hashed password. That is a MUST for security. 

&#x200B;

There are extensive guides online for how to use Node, Express, and Bcrypt like I mentioned above.

I made a codepen based on your code so it's easier to see for everyone. [https://codepen.io/anon/pen/LJvxwb](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/LJvxwb?editors=1100) (Codepen is great for sharing and testing code, I can't recomend it enough! :)

There are dozens of ways to acheive the layout you are describing, but rather than overloading you with new Flexbox and Grid CSS properties, I thought it'd be best to solve it with as little changes  to the original CSS as possible.

I added these 3 lines of CSS to the `h1`in the Codepen:

    display: inline-block;
    width: calc(1050px - 250px - 15px - 250px - 15px);
    text-align: center;

The `calc()` is just a fancy way of letting the browser do the math to find the remaining width after subtracting the sidepanels and their margins.",1537646329.0
,"I'd advise moving away from using float to display anything other than images next to blocks of text. Instead for aligning a couple of bits of text, at least in the ""initial beginner"" phase, i would use display: inline-block. For display: inline:block to ""work"" just remember to make sure that the widths, margins and padding applied a div don't go beyond that of the width you set for the page. i.e if you have 3 divs you want aligned, don't set a width for each beyond 33%.

&#x200B;

Codepen attached, you'll need to mess with the margin, padding values to get it to your liking etc, but hopefully this helps a bit.

For this case you might Google something like ""css fixed to bottom"" or ""css footer bottom"" or even something like ""css always on bottom"".

The tricky part of css is that often the solutions don't work right away (because your element is inheriting something or you need some wrapper divs or whatever) so you sometimes have to play around with it to make it work in your specific situation. What really helped me as I was learning was to implement the given solution in a blank slate html document, then implement that solution step by step in my actual web page and pay attention to the formatting in the inspector to compare what's happening there vs how it appears in the blank document.

anonymousmouse2,"Hey there! There are multiple ways to remove line spacing in HTML/CSS. 

The first is to use css to remove the default margins on those paragraphs

```
.no-margin {
  margin: 0;
}

<p class='no-margin'>901 N. Broadway, STE 1, White Plains NY 10603</p>
```

While this will work, it isn't really semantic since those items aren't actually separate paragraphs. A better approach would be to wrap them all in a single paragraph and use `<br />` to force a line break

```

  901 N. Broadway, STE 1, White Plains NY 10603  <br />

</p>
```

Also I'd like to point out that you should avoid using `<font>` tags in your markup. These have been replaced by better standards and CSS. I'd suggest wrapping each on in a `<span>` and creating CSS classes to assign to them:

```
.footer {
  font-size: 0.5rem;
}

a.unsubscribe {
  color: #000000;
}

<div class='footer'>

Green-Steam,"There are a few factors that might change the way you want do it, such as, the type of element you are using to display the data or what type of data you want to display. You use the document object to grab the element you want. For example 
document.getQuerySelectorAll(""div"") 
returns an array of all the divs in your HTML, or 
document.getElementById(""info"") 
will return the element with the id of ""info"". There are a few other ways to ""get"" an element using the document object, such as, by class or name. The other thing to consider is how you want to add the value to the element. For example, some elements have a value attribute that is displayed while others can display a string. Once you know how you want to grab the element from your HTML and you know how you want to display the data, you can load the JavaScript value in to a variable and assign it to the element. For example, 
document.getElementById(""info"").innerTEXT = value; or
 document.getElementsByClassName(""description"")[0].innerHTML = value;
There are several ways to assign a value, for example, you could also assign your JavaScript value to an attribute.  I am still pretty new to this myself. I hoped that helped out some.",1536886834.0

chrisgaraffa,"Sounds like you have some .html files that you've worked on locally (on your computer) that you want to publish on the Internet for everyone to see, right?

If that's the case, you need to get some web hosting, and potentially buy a domain name. The domain name is going to cost you (somewhere around $8-14 yearly, depending on where you get it from), but you can find ""static site"" hosting for free. The process will be a little different everywhere, but effectively you'll upload your HTML files (plus images, JavaScript, stylesheets, etc - if you have them) to a server somewhere. You'll point your domain name to that server (again, process is different everywhere, but your specific providers can give you instructions).

&#x200B;

If you want to do it all in one place, you can go check out [Namecheap's hosting options](https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/shared.aspx). You can buy the domain from them, and sign up for their Stellar hosting package for $1.44/month. (No affiliation with them - just a happy domain customer.)",1536859775.0

WilliamsGFX,"Your CSS is very inefficient. The next step in your code journey is to be less specific with your classes, or remove some classes altogether.

For example, your h1, #bio, and both P tags all have ""colour:white;"" in them. Is that really required? If white is the default colour for all your items, why not style the body with white and only specify when things AREN'T white.

Even if you didn't want to do that, you have two P classes with specific styles on them that are EXACTLY the same. SW2 and music2 are identical. Do you really need two classes? If all paragraphs are white, just do ""p{color:white;}"" instead.

If you only want some things to be white, you can create a utility class called something like "".text-white{color:white;}"", and "".text-center{text-align:center;}"".

Here, you can pick and choose your battles with specific areas.

As for HTML, I've not looked through, but your header has some unrequired divs within I think. You have a div with a class inside the header tag. Why not just put the class directly onto the header? <header class=""top-nav"">, for example.

TheNickm2,"I would recommend looking into an existing CMS/blog platform. The most popular of which is, of course, WordPress. WordPress will require you to install and set up PHP and a MySQL database in order to run locally. To set this up on Windows, I'd recommend XAMPP or ~~WAMP~~ MAMP (which set up local web servers for you to use). For Mac, use MAMP ~~I believe WAMP has a Mac version~~. On Linux, I'm going to assume you can use your package manager to install a web server, PHP, and MySQL. PS - [https://wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org) is where you'll download WordPress. The .com version of WordPress is in the cloud - which you can certainly use - but it sounds like you want to set something up locally.

Another option is to use a static site generator (I personally use Jekyll). A static site generator is a program that basically combines posts written in markdown with your HTML/CSS/JS templates and outputs webpages as a blog. A static site generator in itself will generally not have a CMS (content management system - which is what you're describing with a login to create posts), but you can still create posts relatively quickly and easily using markdown.

There are certainly additional options, but these two are my personal favorites.

Edit: Thanks u/tastycat for correcting me on WAMP/MAMP usage. I've been running Linux for development for a few years and haven't bothered setting up a web server on Windows (or Mac) in quite some time.",1536557662.0

skidmark_zuckerberg,"A static site generator isn't a bad option. I'm using Gatsby to power my blog personally and it works beautifully. I've also seen the top comment recommend Jekyll. However Gatsby is melded very tightly with React, so if that's your thing go for it. 

Gatsby or Jekyll will let you produce blog posts from backend markdown files. This type of blog is not generally considered very ""end user"" friendly, meaning you wouldn't build a blog that requires adding markdown files as posts for a small business owner, but it's dev friendly and it works great for that purpose. 

Aside from these options, I'm sure you can also utilize the Wordpress API.

I’m curious to learn more about what specifically you’re trying to achieve. Responsive design almost always involves checking viewport _width_ and responding to it.

The HTML *for the same 'Review' link* from another store page looks like this: 

    <a href=""#reviews"" data-av-tab-section-title=""2"" class=""av-section-tab-title av-tab-with-icon av-tab-no-image av-active-tab-title"" style="""">

The only difference between the two is the data attribute ""data-av-tab-section-title"", for which your buggy anchor is set to 1, and the link from another product page is 2. It appears this attribute is setting the tab index for the titles in each section, and this difference is not the reason for the scrolling.


Rather, I think there is a script that contains an EventListener for 'DOMContentLoaded' (Javascript term for when the page is done loading) that is smooth scrolling/scrolling your new link into view, as that seems to be the event that is triggering the scroll. There are a ton of scripts running on your product pages, so i would definitely get your developer involved with this problem because it's going to take some debugging.",1536423351.0

><meta charset=""utf-8"" /> as an example of what is preferred because it allows XML software to access the page. 

It does no such thing. The closing slash would be required by XHTML but you are learning HTML and the closing slash is not used or required.

>I was wondering if <!DOCTYPE html> should also be closed as it is outside the <html> tags.

No. It's a document type declaration, not an enclosing element.

>The style guide says to avoid lines longer than 80 characters. 

I didn't see that in your linked page but that has nothing to do with HTML and it has nothing to do with HTML though you said it's a ""style guide"".

>The Style Guide specifically says to use two spaces and to not use the tab key.

That's a personal preference thing and you'll find many people to argue that with you. Some will tell you 4 spaces or 8 spaces or DO use a tab key.",1536358594.0
SilentDis,"* Closing Slash - Good habit, please do it. It used to matter, way back when. It still does matter in XHTML (and therefore SVG). It does not matter in day-to-day webpage creation. a `<br>` is just as good as a `<br />`, but i like to close everything I open, so I keep the `/`.
* Long lines - ehhhhhh. Whatever. I code in [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) most of the time, and it automatically does the line-wraps. Everyone has their particular editor, their particular IDE, and some don't handle line wraps well (no line numbers and such). I get it, what they're saying is technically fine, but honestly it doesn't matter. Heck, PHP writes out most of my code for me; the actual page code looks horrific, but my scripts are immaculate.
* Blanks and indents - Tabs aren't great, they do make a royal mess of things... if it's an actual tab character. Again, this is just a human-readable thing. The editor I mentioned before, Kate, makes 'em spaces for me. It also can be set to whatever spacing you want, I have it set to 4. Just looks 'better' to me. Same with whitespace; great for human readability, machine doesn't care.

Anyone who's this anal about your code has never worked a day in a production environment. These aren't 'rules' they're giving, they are their own, personal style preferences.  You may have to 'play along' for the grade, but find your own groove and do it a way that makes some sense to you, and works well with the others on the team you're on.

You will, I assume, actually be *using* this stuff, rather than just *teaching* it, and there's a vast sea of difference. Sure, code made with these little style guidelines may look cleaner than mine, I'll give you that. But mine will be out the door and through QA before yours hits the first set of eyes for review, and mine will work just fine.

Who gets the byline on the page? Me.

The only 'guideline' I'll stress is commenting code. Holy shit comment your code. `<!-- -->` and `/* */` are welcome beacons of sanity so I know what the hell you're on about 2 years down the road and the client wanted some change to their site made, and you've moved across the country and I pick it up. If it's anything more complicated than page layout, if you're doing funky stuff with a header call-in, if you're connecting to an esoteric database, pulling a font from Google, whatever it is... let the next guy know, please :)",1536389573.0

There are a lot of ways you can fix this with css or changes to your webpage:

Or: 

Move the <small> tag outside of the <h1> tag so that it does not have that line-height.

**But seriously you should not use cufon text, @font-face is so much better.**

So you can also solve it by removing the cufon text and putting the small tag outside the header tag, or keep it in there and set vertical-align: top (because when it's not cufon you can actually use css).

poopio,"Your code is setting the whole of the text box content - so it is 'typing' it again, it's just replacing what's already there. If you duplicate the code and change the other one to 'P', I'd wager it'll only ever type one letter.

What you need to do is append it to what's there rather than replace it.

Here's an example in jQuery (replace the numbers with letters - I was just being lazy) - [https://codepen.io/guerresinge/pen/Mqmymb?editors=1011#0](https://codepen.io/guerresinge/pen/Mqmymb?editors=1011#0)",1535970092.0
Glagan,"Next time you post code, copy and paste it here using the code balise, it's better.

And for your problem, it's normal. You're replacing the whole value of the textarea with .innerHTML, so each time you click the button you set it to Q.

Also here is some tips:  
The element typed is a textarea, so you access and edit it's value with .value instead of .innerHTML.  
To **add** something to it, you can do

    node.value += ""Q""

to insert it at the end.  

If you keep going like that, you're going to have a lot of functions, one for each keys, you shouldn't do it like that (even tough yes, it's simple and straight forward). You should write a function that get the value or content of the button you clicked on and insert it.  
Here is the function you could write to do that:

    function addLetter(event) {
        document.getElementById(""typed"").value += event.target.textContent;
    }

This code will take an event as a parameter, and an event is given as a parameter on the onClick property. There is a .target property on this event object that is the node that was clicked on. Then the .textContent is the text inside the node, so on your Q button it's the letter Q.
You can simply set the onClick event to ""addLetter"" and it will work.

    <button type=""button"" onClick=""addLetter(event)"">Q</button>

Also, adding event like that is also simple, but there is a function to do it in JavaScript:

    node.addEventListener('typeOfEventToCapture', callback);

So for you case you could do it like that:

    document.getElementById(""qButton"").addEventListener('click', addLetter);

And then you can make it even more simple and avoid doing it for each buttons.  
Let's say each of your letter buttons have a class .letter, you can select all of them with that and add the event listener to each one of them in one line:

    document.querySelectorAll('.letter').forEach(function(button) {
        button.addEventListener('click', addLetter);
    });

And that's it ! I might have gone too far, i don't know, tell me if you don't understand something.",1535971087.0

First of all, if your image is in the same directory as your html file you don’t have to add `/images/` to the `src` attribute. By adding `/images/` you are telling the browser to look for the image in a separate folder, therefor your markup should look like this:

JeromeAtWork,"HTML is a good starting point, but you will also have to learn CSS and javascript is you want a job in web development.",1535065272.0
SomeGuy999999999,"HTML in itself will most likely not land you a job. You would need CSS as well. Think of HTML as all the information you want to display on the website. While CSS is how the website is styled.  Both go hand in hand. It is very unlikely a company will need only HTML. JavaScript would be the language that would help you get a job as web developer. I would go as far to say it's even a requirement for web development because the major frameworks companies use are written in JavaScript.

I think a important distinction that needs to be made is that HTML/CSS are not programming languages. Rather they are mark up languages. There's no logic to them. You just write it and it appears. JavaScript on the other hand is very much a programming language. You can use logic to manipulate the DOM and only display what you want and when you want. You can even style the website differently using JavaScript logic.

My suggestion is that if you are interested in web development. Definitely learn HTML/CSS first, but don't spend all your time mastering it. When you're comfortable, start learning JavaScript but vanilla JavaScript. Meaning no frameworks. Then when you're comfortable, start looking at some of the frameworks like React.js, Vue.js, or Ember. ",1535069131.0

The reason is because Facebook captures what you are typing on every key press. They store this in your profile.

I believe the bug happens somewhere between broadcasting what you’re typing and rendering the current state to the text box.

Your content is set to 700px wide, meaning once you shrink your browser to lower than 700px it’s going to create a horizontal scroll bar. What you want to be doing is setting `max-width: 700px`. This says “Hey, be as wide as you can until you hit the max width. Otherwise, since you’re a block element, just span the full width of the viewport.”. I’d suggest also adding some padding to give a little space on each side.

chmod777,"you need a `<form>` tag wrapping your form. by default, the fomr will submit to the page it is on. if you want it to submit to another page, you need the `action` attribute. 

you will probably want to add a `method` to the form as well - `post` or `get`. those do what they say. a post posts info to the action, while the get gets info from the action. here, you'd be posting a number to a handler.

and that is the end of the html portion. from there, if you want to further handle the form action, you need a server of some type to process the submission. what happens then will depend on your needs and your server. ",1534692210.0
anonymousmouse2,"Hey there! There's a lot going on here but let's start with answering your question.

There are a few ways to achieve this. One is to use multiple background images on a single element -- like the body -- and set their positioning through background styles. Here's an example of that: [https://jsfiddle.net/36Lb5mfc/8/](https://jsfiddle.net/36Lb5mfc/8/). Notice that each background style has multiple properties that are comma separated. You can read more about multiple backgrounds on MDN or W3S. 

The second method is to use fixed positioned image elements and set their z-index. This is useful if you want to use embedded images and not set them through CSS. You can do this with \`position: fixed;\` and setting their z-index lower than the content. [https://jsfiddle.net/5n4Laebd/3/](https://jsfiddle.net/5n4Laebd/3/). Note that I'm using \`top\` and \`left\` to position instead of changing the margins. 

That should work across all browsers. 

Now let's talk about your code itself. The way in which you are writing your styles is less than ideal. Many elements with a ton of inline-styling makes code unreadable and unmanageable. I also noticed you are using things like \`<font>\` tags which are no longer in the spec and are obsolete, \`<b>\` tags when you should be using \`<strong>\` tags, and \_lots\_ of usage of margins to move elements around. This makes me assume that whatever guide you're using to learn is seriously dated. A few suggestions:

* Try moving all your styling to re-useable CSS styles and utilize classes to style your elements. 
* Use tabs and indenting to format your code, everything is in-line and it's very difficult to understand hierarchy 
* Don't use floats for positioning, try learning more about flexbox or CSS Grid

Badrush,"THe easiest way to vertical align is to use flexbox in the CSS.

It's simple you have the parent container, usually a div, and inside you have the children elements that you are trying to vertically center inside of the parent.

In your CSS you add 

`display: flex;` 

`flex-direction:row;` 

`align-items: center;`


...to the PARENT element only (so `div.parent` if that's the class name you have used for the parent). 

This will automatically vertically align all the children. 

Now your problem is a little different, since you want two things stacked on top.

One option is to make the image the background of your parent (container) div and then proceed as above.

The other option is that you have your parent div with `position: relative` and two child divs with `position: absolute; top:0; left:0` and make sure these two divs have `width: 100%; height:100%`. These two divs will overlap each other. Then inside one you put the image and inside the other you put the `<p>`. The last step is to make sure both are vertically centered. So apply the above to the TWO sibling `divs` that are direct parents of the text and of the image.

A br tag is just a line break. Your pm is probably not rendering the html and is displaying the raw html.

This is just formatting code and isn't a script so it won't run anything nasty on your site. Chances are your PM's are escaping the characters as a security measure. Or if someone said <script>nasty script</script> in a pm it would just display that as text as opposed to running it. ",1533476053.0

I would try using a reset.css and overriding the width with

.nav {

header {

I always use vh and vw for just about everything, since it scales to page size.

I believe this is the one you're referencing. There are other third party scripts that can also be used to accomplish the same thing, usually with different features.

PixelatorOfTime,"Everyone else has covered the basics, but this flowchart will help you figure out which ones of the new HTML5 tags to use, and when. [http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.pdf](http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.pdf). This process of *semantics* has two main purposes: SEO and accessibility. A third might be for AI and machine learning in the future (i.e. you use the right tags to help places like a summary generation bot figure out where the main content on your website is at in the document flow—like an <article> inside of a <main>—and then it can seamlessly know which content to summarize without human input).

The background on this was that before HTML5, people were basically adding the same classes to commonly used containers on *every* website they built. Like <div class=""header""> or <div class=""sidebar"">. To standardize things, those became <header> and <aside>, respectively. Now everyone can use those to clarify the intent of their markup, which helps you stay organized in addition to the benefits mentioned above. No special features or unique functionality is gained, but it's way easier to keep track of.

Please note that you can still add classes to these new tags; especially when you are using the same tags for different parts of your document.. You might have a single page that contains both a <footer class=""page-footer""> and a <footer class=""content-footer""> (maybe this contains the author info at the end of an article) which helps to clarify things further. There's nothing saying you can only use these new tags once per page.",1533107222.0

anonymousmouse2,">  but I am using bottom to push elements up to the correct vertical position.

Yeah...don't do that haha. Everything in your page should be dynamic based on its content. 

Looking at your code, I think the first thing you should do is start by researching the [box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model). You should avoid as much as possible using relative layouts with static top and left values. The box model helps you lay out the elements the way you need them to be laid out. 

One thing I noticed is that your HTML itself doesn't match the nesting hierarchy of your page. You have everything nested together at the same level inside the `.container` even though there is a clear hierarchy in the design. 

I made some changes to your code for you, take a look at what I did to get the layout you need: https://jsfiddle.net/fz3wn7bq/21/",1533078200.0

RandyHoward,"You need a lot more than just HTML to do this. The basics of it are that you need a page with a form on it, that has a text field for the user to enter that word, and a submit button. When the submit button is pressed, you would send the data in the form to some kind of processing script. That script can be written in numerous languages, but it isn't something that HTML alone can handle. You'd use javascript, PHP, or some other back end language. That processing script would grab the value submitted through the form, and store it somewhere. It could be stored in a database, a flat file, or a few other places. Then when someone else loads up a page, you can grab that value (with a back end language such as PHP) and display what is stored on their computer. When the original user closes out their browser, you can run a script that clears that stored value. You can also set a timestamp so the stored value expires, and continually update the timestamp until the browser is closed. There's lots of ways to do things at this point. But long story short, you can't do this with just HTML.",1533055538.0

Just export your site as HTML and then upload it to your GitHub pages repo using the online uploader (GitHub identifies the repo for pages by its name).

Not gonna give a detailed explanation but I think it should point you towards the correct stuff. GitHub doesn't support PHP anyways so it's really not possible to mess anything up security wise unless you somehow manage to put some private key or password into the files.

I saw no one answered this question so I answer it...

Create a map like google maps to your website is not hard ....

You have to ways first you can use google API (s) that are  very easy (In this case you choose a width and height and map location)  and then google give you some html code ( maybe with css  and java script) and then you copy and past and enjoy it

The second way is  few hard... in this case you create a JSON database and import it in js files and use some javascript Library or Framework  like jquary and jquary ui ( You have to use it to draggable ) or Framework for example Angular or Vue js or React

First way is very easy and second way is very cutimization

Niadlol,"As someone else said formatting, or removing useless code when asking a question makes everything simpler.

Okay so....

You have a style tag in the body, should keep those in the head tag.  
You have more than one style tag for no reason.  
You use Muse and requireJS for no reason.

All you would need is:

    <p>Click anywhere to skip intro</p>
    <video id=""my_video"" autoplay style=""max-width:100%"">
        <source src=""intro.mp4"" type=""video/mp4"">
    </video>

To redirect when clicking anywhere, add this to your noClickRedirect function:

        //Click anywhere to redirect
        document.body.addEventListener('click', function() {
            window.location.href = 'http://test.com/home.html';
        });

The name on that function is also stupid, it sets up two event listener.

You could also make another function to make it easier to read:

    function setupEventListeners() {

        //Click anywhere to redirect
        document.body.addEventListener('click', redirectToMain);
 
        //Get the video element
        video = document.getElementById('my_video');
 
        //Add redirect function to the ended event of the video element.
        video.addEventListener('ended', redirectToMain);
 
        //Disable right click on the video element (Why do you even do this?)
        video.addEventListener('contextmenu', function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();
        }, false);
 
    }

    function redirectToMain() {
            window.location.href = 'http://test.com/home.html';    
    }
 
    setupEventListeners();


Now that I have said all this... there seems to be no reason as to why the video should not play.

Unless you are trying this on a mobile, mobile devices only autoplay videos that are muted otherwise you need a user gesture (click or something similar) to start a video with sound.

The general tags are where you're usually going to find information about the page (keywords, description) and how to display the site (content-type, viewport).  Referrer is how to handle the URL in the browser, and theme-color seems to be a custom tag.  

You can use the keywords to generally categorize websites, but, it's usually consistent across an entire subdomain, so reddit doesn't have keywords for each subreddit or topic.

mattpilz,"There are a lot of technical issues that cause things to not work in that code. Just a quick review...

You cannot use HTML-style comments within your stylesheet definitions. This will cause the styles to fail. Instead, use /* CSS Comment */ - This is why none of the CSS is working.

You do not properly close certain attributes which can cause rendering issues. Such as:

    alt=""Milo width=""600""

And

    src=""Kriv.jpg alt=""Kriv""

You have some odd and unnecessary/invalid definitions (but this may be from pasting into Reddit) like:

    [div.gallery](https://div.gallery)

Just use: div.gallery {

The padding and margins are throwing off your percentage system and will cause stuff to wrap where you don't expect it. You can apply **box-sizing: border-box;** to the .responsive class and then the widths will be all-inclusive (so you can use 25% width with four elements and even with padding/margins they will stretch the full screen).

You do have a fragmented chunk of CSS for box-sizing but it is messed up in unclosed comments etc. That should be removed.

With these changes you will have a functional structure (although there is definite room for simplification).

2. As far as I know, `var userinput1 = document.calculator1.input1.value` isn't a valid way to access DOM elements — since all your inputs have ID tags, try swapping these variable definitions out to use JS's `getElementById()` function (e.g. `var userinput1 = document.getElementById('input1').value`).

 You can also look at [this article](https://css-tricks.com/fluid-width-equal-height-columns/), which discusses different methods of doing this, though really, that's mostly just there to give you a concept of how complex this issue could be before Flexbox and Grid came along.",1531528818.0

ergnui34tj8934t0,"PHP and HTML are just languages. Each has its particular usage and can't be substituted for the other directly, though they're very much related in usage as you've said. 

Instead of thinking about languages, think about browsers for a sec. I'll simplify it a lot: What a web browser does when a user types in a URL is it goes and sees what's at the address provided; for most web *pages*, what will be at the other end is some code. Just code, not a webpage. That code *describes* a webpage, so it's the browser's job to take the instructions there and render it on your screen.

In general, browsers understand three languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. (there's also webassembly and maybe other stuff, but I won't get into that.) So when you go to google.com, what happens is Google's servers see the particular URL you went to and get the right HTML, CSS, JS to describe the webpage you're asking for. The clever thing is that that code doesn't have to be written as HTML, CSS, JS on the server side—only the stuff the browser gets back has to be! That's where PHP comes in.

PHP (like JS and Ruby as the other user mentioned, but many many languages do this as well) is a *scripting* language (as opposed to, say, a *markup* language like HTML). It takes the idea of HTML and adds more functionality by generating *dynamic* web pages. 

So depending on, for example, the URL I send the server, the PHP code on the server may decide to send different HTML back. Like if I went to facebook.com/user/1, facebook's server side php might have an HTML template that looks at the URL, says OK they want the users page filled with user 1's data, and sends back HTML with user 1's data filled in. So the client (the browser) ALWAYS gets back HTML/CSS/JS, even if you used other tools to generate that on the server side. If you didn't have a PHP/Ruby/JS backend, you'd have to write a whole different HTML, CSS, and JS file for each webpage. Instead you can write a more general template.

PHP also does other stuff I assume, but I've never really used it. Do you have any questions about this?",1531525889.0
Eric_S,"PHP can be embedded within HTML and it can output HTML (or just about any other text format), so it's really not that PHP can do anything HTML can do.  

On the other hand, serving a direct HTML file is much less resource intense than serving a similar page that is constructed with PHP.  A PHP file needs to be parsed (though the parsed tree can be cached) and then executed in order to create the HTML  This execution takes resources that simply reading the file from storage wouldn't.  So really, PHP only makes sense if the HTML is dynamic, which is to say that it changes. ",1531528264.0

anonymousmouse2,"I could be wrong, but I believe it's because there's no inline style added by default. So when the page loads, there's no inline styles applied and your if statement returns false. If you use the inspector you can see this happening, the first time you click the button it adds `display: none` so now the next time your function is ran, the if statement is truth-y and toggles accordingly. 

So in this case a quick fix would be to add `style=""display: none""` to your div.


A few extra things to note here:

1. Don't put all your CSS attributes on a single line like that, that's a really bad practice and will make maintaining stylesheets very difficult in the future.
2. `<br />` has been deprecated and shouldn't be used in modern websites.
3. A better practice would be to toggle the ""hidden"" class instead of `style.display`. So your function could simply be:

```
var x = document.getElementBtId(""DIV-DB"")
x.classList.toggle(""hidden"");
```",1530568430.0
anonymousmouse2,"There are good ways to do it, and there are bad ways.

**BAD:**

* Using Floats. With modern CSS, there is no reason you should be floating anything. Period.
* Absolute Positioning. Using absolute positioning has some unintended side-effects, especially on mobile.
* Bootstrap. If you're already using it, that's fine. Don't bring in a giant framework just for one use case though.

**GOOD:**

* Flexbox. This is my preferred way to achieve this and is pretty short and simple. It's also best for responsive designs.
* CSS Grids. Be careful here though, as Grids aren't fully supported across browsers

Take a look at how I built it as an example. Most of that is style, the actual code itself to get the layout you want is only 4 lines to set up the flex layout. Best part is that it is 100% responsive on all devices --> [https://jsfiddle.net/m6829Lfs/7/](https://jsfiddle.net/m6829Lfs/7/)

You can see in my example I'm not using any, and only using padding on the parent to give it some breathing room.

are you trying to do something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/f4jgbL3z/5/? you can generate the posts by what ever method you want. i just used js to spit something out quick.

but in general, you should reference the post to a database id, and get all the relevant post meta from that. ",1529664839.0
mattpilz,"This problem is more correctly addressed through a database and server-side solution, but that also represents a much larger commitment. In that scenario you would have a database table with fields for ""Id"", ""Title"", ""Image"" and ""Content"". Each blog entry would be added as a separate row to the database. Then you could use a server-side script (PHP) to fetch all the records and spit them out as HTML on your generated page.

But for now, your best approach using a strict HTML/JavaScript solution would be to use AJAX/load capabilities that can pull in separate HTML files and insert the content as needed in your main page. With jQuery you could simply use [Load()](http://api.jquery.com/load/) or similar [AJAX functions](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/#json) with native JavaScript.

So each of your blog posts could be created as a separate HTML file ""1.html"", ""2.html"", ""3.html"" and so on. The HTML contents would only contain the entry-specific code snippets, e.g.:

`<div class=""blogpost"">`

`<h2 class=""blogtitle"">Blog Entry Title</h2>`

`<img src=""img.jpg"" class=""blogimage""/>`

`<div class=""blogtext"">Text</div>`

`</div>`

Then using jQuery or vanilla JavaScript you can iterate through and import each of the HTML files and append their contents to a main container div on your standard HTML page.",1529664916.0
TheTrueAloe,all of this a very possible and I am actually planning on making a video on something just like this very soon.  But with HTML alone it couldn't be done.  For this you are gonna want to download XAMPP if not already so you can practice php development.  You will be able to use php and sql to do the registration and login and the ranking can just be a numeric value in the sql database.  All this will be very easy once you wrap your head around cookies in php.  I hope this helps guide you to a passing grade xD,1529908320.0
RandyHoward,"Yes it's possible. You'll output your entire table to the page and use javascript to show/hide certain rows. You'll need to tag the rows with a class so that you know which ones to turn on/off. Something like:

    <tr class=""option1""><td>...</td></tr>
    <tr class=""option2""><td>...</td></tr>

And you'll have some buttons that might look like:

    <button class=""all"">ALL</button>
    <button class=""option1"">Option 1</button>
    <button class=""option2"">Option 2</button>

Then you'll use javascript to set an event listener for clicks on those buttons. When the button is clicked, check the class that's on that button, and show all the rows that have that same class on them and hide the rest. In the case of ""all"" you just have to show all rows.",1529637083.0
RandyHoward,"The @ is probably causing you trouble, you need to percent-encode that symbol. @ symbol is %40, so your URL would be:

    hello.com/a%40a.com

If that doesn't work, try encoding the period as well. Period is %2E",1529619832.0
mattpilz,"My recommendation would be to assign each user a unique ""id"" and then use that for the page, rather than explicitly naming an HTML file to match their email address.

* Using an @ sign in a filename is discouraged as different browsers and platforms will interpret it differently.
* If a search engine ever discovers and indexes these pages, the email address will be fully visible in search results and a loss of one's privacy.
* If the user ever changes their email address the URL will mismatch.
* If anyone else knows or guesses one's email address they can also access that user's page by manually entering the URL.

Instead of having a page ""johndoe@example.com"" just create an arbitrary ID and associate it with that account (e.g., ""AA4EDQoACQ8.html""). You could generate one via http://www.shortguid.com/#/guid/uid-64",1529650192.0

GoDzM4TT3O,"You cannot shorten a local path. I’d recommend using 5gbfree (free 5gb) or maybe, even better, [FreeHostingEU](https://freehostingeu.com). 

It gives you a custom .eu5.net, .eu3.biz or .eu3.org subdomain for free! Example: I want to choose “onlinetips” as my subdomain, and .eu5.net as the domain. 

The result will be [onlinetips.eu5.net](onlinetips.eu5.net). You can also purchase domains like yourdomain.com but I’d stick to the free subdomain. You will also have: SQL database, phpMyAdmin 4, Webmail (you need to purchase a domain), **FREE FILE HOSTING** etc!

It also has Joomla and Wordpress!

Also, if you have a Github account, you could use the free service called “Github pages” to create a(n open-source) website!

Go to your profile, click on “create new repository” and, in the name, put <your username>.github.io. In this case, my username is GoDzM4TT3O, so I will put [GoDzM4TT3O.github.io](GoDzM4TT3O.js.org). Since I’ve got a free domain using [js.org](js.org), I will create a new file called `CNAME` (without any extension, such as .txt etc.) on my new repo and type `GoDzM4TT3O.js.org` , but first I will follow the steps on js.org.

HTML is a mock\-up language; It's a design tool. Not a programming language.

So, using the ONLY HTML to make a bidding, or shopping site is impossible. However, HTML allows you to use other programming languages in your HTML file. So, you can you use JavaScript, PHP, etc. in your HTML file. But for your request, PHP is the Programming language you can use here. But the cons of PHP is that you must have an active server in order for it to work. If you don't have your own server, then there is a lot of websites that give you free and paid to host, e.g. GoDaddy (Paid), 000Webhost (Free).

But there is another way.

You can use Google Forms to create the thing your asking for, and best of all, you don't need to code, and Google form is very easy to use, after creating the form, you can send it to your co\-workers through email, or link. also, it will collect live response, and also show the respondents all the results. And that is exactly what you're asking for, and also you don't need any server to use Google forms. Here is a sample I made; [https://goo.gl/forms/en60ok9MJYLp4xW82](https://goo.gl/forms/en60ok9MJYLp4xW82)

ThreeHunnaDays,"Free Resources -

Your local library will likely have books on HTML (mine has over 15). You should look for newer ones though, specifically those that specify HTML5. 

Codecademy is a VERY basic start and may refresh your knowledge on very basic concepts.

Skillshare provides hundreds of courses of all experience levels on HTML. There are many ways to get a month or two of free Skillshare, you just have to do a little research. 

Paid Resources -

Before going into paid resources, you should probably dip your feet into Web Development and see if it’s right for you. Overcome frustrating challenges/obstacles first, and see if you’re certain you want to continue learning.

There are some apps (e.g. Encode and Mimo) that will run you through the basics, and maybe some more intermediate concepts, but you will have to subscribe or make a one-time purchase to unlock everything.

Udemy and LinkedIn Learning provide professional courses that I would highly recommend (Udemy has a sale right now that opens many HTML5/General Web Development courses for only $15 CAD, and they give you a degree at the end to use on your LinkedIn profile. I learned off Udemy, so I would highly suggest here if you’re serious. 

There are many more, but these are the resources I learned with. Hope this helps. ",1528812266.0

You can monitor an input element for changes using the **oninput** event handler. This would allow you to monitor the length in real-time as it is typed, for instance to check what percentage it is compared to the maximum allowed size.

You can do this similarly by attaching an **onclick** handler to an input or submit button, which will be called when the user presses a button.
 
I created a quick fiddle demonstrating a few things relating to this. In the example, a text field has a max length of 15. As you begin typing in it a label will update to show you the total length as well what percentage it is to being maxed out (sort of like Twitter).

mattpilz,"Domain registration and hosting are two separate subjects. 

Registering a domain will reserve the actual website address for your use. It usually costs about $10 a year. I've had mostly positive experiences with Namecheap over many years. You can register a domain at any point even if you do not have a website built or even one started. Renewal is done annually unless you purchase multiple years at a time.

Hosting is the service that allocates space, bandwidth and other necessities for you to actually upload your HTML documents for the public to view on your domain. This is more expensive and typical packages (on a shared host which is fine for the majority of websites) will cost around $8-10 a month. But many of them also offer *discounts* if you pay in 1-2+ year installments instead of monthly, so you may pay $100/yr. instead of $10/month.

Once you have your hosting you can design your site locally or typically install WordPress or another service through their platform (many have one-click installers to make this easy). You will need to first update your DNS (name servers) of your domain through the domain registrar based on the name servers the web host provides to you. Once the DNS has been updated and propagated (24-48 hours) you'll be able to upload and view your content online.

stevewastaken,"It's a basic start but you should be happy with what you've made so far. You could do with making use of some new HTML 5 tags and use a more semantic approach to your layout \- why not include a \<header\> section with a featured post or banner, and perhaps an \<aside\> element with a sidebar of information? You could also try using some \<article\> tags to better highlight your content where appropriate.

You probably don't need the 'Administrator? Click here' button as that only really applies to one person. As you have font\-awesome installed, why not just add a login icon to your navigation header? You also could do with implementing some kind of category and page navigation, as right now outside of posts listed on the home page there's no way to drill down into your content.

Your posts layout could also do with having a container element with a max\-width set to make it more easy to read. Your current set up is perfect for mobile devices, but on big screens your posts are going to be stretched super far. Setting this to something like 900px for these elements might make life a bit easier for your readers.

Each post has quite a basic border, it looks crisp and clean but why not experiment with some more colours or a more visually simply way of differentiating each post? You could use dividers or \<hr\> elements to provide a visual cue for where each post ends. It'd also be cool if you added some more demo content into each post so you can play around with typography. No post in reality is going to consist of just paragraphs, why not give each a heading and a featured photo? You could try putting the heading on one line and the paragraph underneath to make the flow a little better, and make the size of the title larger to make it easier for users to find what they're interested in.

If you haven't already, why not try playing with a front\-end framework, like Bootstrap or Foundation \(several others exist, too\)? These are really easy to get working with but offer a lot of flexibility. You can modify the elements that exist and get to grips with responsive design, then move on to adding the dynamic elements from there. Not only that, but they're super common in the front\-end world and you're likely to need them if you ever choose to build a career in development.

Here's a nice blog layout example built with Bootstrap: [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/blog/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/blog/)

instead of creating a new button that would simulate the enter key being hit, Ive added the ""function"" or ""attribute"" or what ever the right word is, to the templates. now they all get created with

""onclick=""templateClicked\(this, event\)"" ondblclick=""fireDefaultAction\(this\)"" ontouchstart=""fireDefaultAction\(this\)""

I've  created a really quick codepen that just gets the basic layout out of the way: https://codepen.io/MathiasaurusRex/pen/NMZLxg

I've really enjoyed being able to use the following flexbox combo as it allows some extremely quick layouts that need ""content on left / content on right"" :

`nav { 
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}`

If you need to include a hamburger navigation on smaller breakpoints I would do something simple like hide the <ul> on mobile and include a <button>Click to reveal menu</button> tag that an individual can click and display the <ul> and the corresponding list items.

One item that I would like to call out is that you should also make sure that your hamburger menu button has some sort of corresponding text so that individuals who use assistive technology know that it's a button that opens more of the menu.

`ul {`

`list-style-type: none;`

`}`

`li {`

`display: inline;`

`}`

If you need this to be centred on the page, you need to set your parent element's margins to auto. Say your HTML looks like this:

`<ul>`

`<li>nav item 1</li>`

`<li>nav item 2</li>`

`<li>nav item 3</li>`

`</ul>`

`</nav>`

You can add the following to the page to centre align your nav:

`<style type=""text/css"">`

`nav {`

`margin: auto;`

`}`

`ul {`

`list-style-type: none;`

`text-align: center;`

`}`

`li {`

`display: inline;`

Preferably you'd put this in an external stylesheet but this should work.

Quick tips:

The styling could use some work. I know you want to keep the website lightweighted, but consider making the inputbox a lot bigger, especially on mobile, it's just not convenient to have it so small

You should probably add a footer, with links to FAQ, about and/or disclaimer. When I upload my code, I want to know my rights and how you and if you are planning on using it. If you're not, awesome! But make sure to tell the user. It could be as easy as adding this to your upload page:
   
      ✓ lightweighted and fast

      ✓ always online

      ! By uploading, you accept the terms and conditions (= url to t&c)

   
For UX, some button that automatically copies the url, would be great!

Usually a domain is unavailable to purchase for a number of weeks to allow the existing owner to renew at varying degrees of cost depending on how late after the expiration date they choose to do this.

If they've owned it since the 90s and it's going unused, the fact that they're asking for $15k could fall under cybersquatting regulations. That's basically when an individual or company sits on a domain to benefit and profit from someone else's trademark or goodwill.

If they aren't using the domain currently, then it's simple supply and demand my friend \- you demand something that only they can supply, so they're asking for stupid amounts of money. In this case, $15,000.

Are you 100&#37; certain that this domain isn't being used, or whether you can purchase an alternate domain yourself?",1525118737.0
RandyHoward,"> Can I swoop in at that exact moment and buy it myself

No you cannot. The domain does not become available to purchase for a period of time after it expires, I think 30 days, so that the owner has a chance to renew the domain if they forgot, had a billing issue, etc.

If they're asking that much, I would not count on them letting it expire at all. It's very possible it's set to automatically renew and the whois listing wouldn't look any different.

I must say, a domain name isn't what's going to make or break a company. If you can't get it just pick something else. The domain name used to matter a lot for SEO, but they changed that years ago and the only thing you really have to worry about is that the domain is memorable.",1525119062.0
ComicOzzy,"> they're currently asking $15,000 for it and have owned it since the 90s

My boss had a chance to buy our 4-letter .com name when our company first opened, but it was being offered for $6,000. Now, it's owned by another company. If you go to that domain, it just redirects to the main page of that company... a multi-billion dollar international corporation. It would probably cost a lot more than $6,000 just to get someone there to give you the time of day to even begin the process of negotiating that domain away from them. ",1525125551.0

After declaring your namespace, you'd have to add an xlink tag to actually use it - something like `<xlink:a href=mailto:...>`. Or maybe you could just add `xlink:href` directly to an svg tag. I know nothing about xlink though, so I can't tell you what the valid tags and attributes are.

Sorry for my english I am from Germany.

I think the best way to implement this is by using the svg tag and an a tag inside the svg. This will create a true circular area to click.
You can also add the text with a text tag.

For example the circular shaped button:

<svg width=""140"" height=""140"">
  <a href=""#"">
    <circle cx=""70""
        cy=""70""
        r=""70""
        fill=""#FF0000"" />

     <text x=""70""
       y=""70""
       fill=""#000000""
       text-anchor=""middle""
       alignment-baseline=""middle"">
       Emergencies
       </text>
     </a>
</svg>

I think this would be the cleanest aprouch. You just have to figure out the shape and placement. But you could create this shape in Illustrator or something similar export it as svg code and than add the links with the a tags.

Garbee,"> semantic HTML5

Semantic to whom? A user? The developer maintaining the site? A machine trying to figure out what is going on?

Semantics is an endless rabbit hole of questioning. It really comes down to what point of view you're looking at it from. Try not to focus on the semantic bits too much. Focus more on the accessibility that the elements create together (or should create if browsers ever do the document outline mentioned later.)

> and accessibility

If the element doesn't map to the accessibility tree or provide some interaction on events (like `button`s, `dialog`, `details`, etc.) then the markup is mostly no better than a `<div>`. Let's break down your example:

1. `<main>` - The [main element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main) does map the aria `role=""main""` attribute to this element automatically for you. So (as long as you don't need IE support) you're good here. It does improve the accessibility tree.
2. `<article>` - The [article element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) doesn't really do anything internally. So on accessibility you aren't gaining anything from using this. On the semantics front, it depends. You aren't including a heading element within it as ""required"". This is for one day when browsers may finally implement the new [document outline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines) it will be properly structured for the outline tree. Your use of it however does look off. Think of it this way, ""Would I send this over say an RSS feed to someone?"" if yes, `<article>` is fine, if no, `<section>` is what you want. So, would you send your hero image over an RSS feed? Or the additional image content? Most likely not. So you'd want this article to be a `<section>` instead.
3. `<figure>` - The [figure element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure) is recommended for content that is referenced in your main document but isn't displayed inline with the text. Much like a figure in a textbook. Your application of it for a hero image is _probably_ incorrect. Since you shouldn't be referencing a hero image in the document generally. Also, no accessibility gained from using a figure element. It is essentially a div internally for the accessibility tree. Figures just have some special styling for `figcaption` to look nicer by default together.
4. `<section>` - The [section element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section) is basically the alternative to an `<article>` for the document outline. The only difference is, article is something you'd distribute externally while a section is an internal document section you wouldn't really share. It seems to me, your section element *should* be your article element.
5. `<aside>` - The [aside element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside) is for extra content related to the document but not a part of the main content. This is where the additional images bit is fuzzy on semantics. Honestly, you get no real benefit in any way using an `<aside>` compared to a `<div>` for this use-case, if it is just images. It's purely for your benefit as the developer maintaining it. On accessibility here, there is no direct benefit either. At least until that magical document outline gets implemented in 60 or so years. (Joking on the time range. I think.)

Now that we've gone over your current code. Here is what I'd recommend given the context:

    <main>
        <figure>hero image</figure>
        <article><h1>Heading</h1> <div>content</div></article>
        <aside>additional images</aside>
    </main>

From your screenshot, you have one article to a page. So you forget the container within main and just get to the content quickly.

The thing to keep in mind with everything, is put your users first. Look into the elements and say, ""Will something else provide a better experience to people using the site or application?"" If the answer is yes, use the better tool. If no, then don't worry about it too much.",1523909963.0

DaFreak686,"I am learning HTML semantics as well so take this with a grain of salt but from what I can see you are on the right path. As for the figure tag, from what I understand, you would use that to wrap an image tag. The figure doesn't replace the img tag it just ads semantic value. 

Here is a [link](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/creative-professional/whats-difference-image-figure-tags-html5) talking specifically about the figure tag that should be helpful for you. The use of some of these semantic tags can often be a judgment call.

But you can override this property with CSS! `display: inline-block;` will make it take up just the space it needs. I also added `vertical-align: top;` so that the tops of the blocks align, in case the images or captions are different sizes.

[Here's an updated JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/kse8z6jr/8/)

One other thing to note is that you can wrap the entire `figure` in an `a` tag to make the image and caption a link - you don't need to do them separately. But as a result of this, you'll want to make sure there's no spaces between the opening `<a>` and the opening `<figcaption>`, because inline-block takes spaces between elements into account.

you probably don't want `button`s, you want `radio`s. those switch state. they also make it so you can only have one of the two, either on or off. they also allow you to do some fancy styling. a checkbox will also let you do the fancy styling, but since multiple checkboxes can be chosen at the same time, they are bad for switching between values. using the `+` css combinator, you can then add some styles for when they are ""on"" or ""off"".

so for the actual functional part of this, lets use the jquery ajax libraries, as they are pretty robust. lets also attach event listeners via the `.on()` function, so that when you change state, they fire off an event.

Another would be the fact there is no guarantee the browser will continue to be lenient in what it accepts. The current browsers might accept multiple IDs per page but future versions may not. Do you really want to go back and fix this 6 months down the road ? Do you even want to consider you might have to do this? (odds are very low that browsers will ever enforce this particular rule IMO)

Probably the best reason is javascript. Just IMO but the best thing for using IDs is targeting specific elements. And this is where using multiple IDs will bite you.

Anyway.  You are deep into the HTML5 concept of how a written article should be set up. Forget that for right now.

Start simple with paragraph blocks. Enter whatever text. Call your images/videos/whatever (src=). Take a look at what you get.

You should see plain text and images at the left margins.

Everything okay?  Now, start formatting right into the HTML text (not via CSS, yet).

Text look good? Start writing CSS. Remember that the browser is going to look at the HTML tags, check whether there are any style tags on the HTML page, and finally look at the CSS.

Floating divs almost never act the way you think they should, and they act differently in different browsers. See if you can use CSS to position your image blocks.

tyler_the_compiler,"Hey,

So the only critique I have for you is related to your actual repository itself. Until you address the issues with it in general, no one is going to actually look at your code. This may sound harsh, but it's just the truth. Allow me to explain why:

* Organizational structure. Your repository has none of it.^1

* What am I looking at? What is this? Why is are you committing the Chrome installation executable?^2 

* Your Readme tells us absolutely nothing about your project, but furthermore, it's even more confusing than if you didn't bother having on at all, ie. Why are there installation instructions (incomplete at that)^3; Why are you detailing every change you've made to the repository in the Readme^4? What is Splash-Out, and why is it the only thing mentioned?^5

-------

1 - It appears (cause again, there isn't really any structure, or logic to the repository) as though there are multiple projects present. They need to be contained, preferably in their own, separate repositories. If -for whatever reason - this is not possible, then at the very least separate the projects into separate folders, and commit them to the repository in that fashion. How do I know which CSS file belongs to which HTML? What script belongs to what page? Etc...

2 - You seem to have simply pushed an entire folder into a repository, regardless of the folders contents. There is no need for there to be executables in your repository (that said, there is an exception to every rule, but in web dev, this should never be required). 

3 - Unless you are building a framework, library, or app, there should be no need for installation instructions when it comes to a web dev portfolio. If for whatever reason you need to provide installation instructions, it's imperative you include them, and not leave the instructions blank.

4 - Your commit comments should explain in enough detail what you've changed - and why - if your code itself isn't self-explanatory in this are. That said, it should; commit comments should explain nebulous, or abstract changes that may not be obvious in a code review.

5 - If you are not going to complete the Readme, and only half-ass the description for a singular, non-descriptive part of the repository, then honestly, don't bother with the Readme in the first place.

----

So I get this may seem harsh, but what you've presented is a complete non-starter when it comes to a code review. No body is going to try to navigate that mess, and be able to give any meaningful feedback for you.

Atlas2211,"1. You would just save the file as pagename.html and double click it to open it in a web browser and view it.   Won’t exactly be pretty without some CSS though.

The concept that you are describing is called responsive design. This means that your layout can change based on screen size. Googling Responsive design techniques will put you in the right direction.

In CSS, you can use something called Media Queries that you can use to check the width of the screen and adjust your CSS accordingly. So for instance, if the screen is small, maybe you could stack your three boxes vertically.

There are also a variety of JavaScript libraries out there that help you a ton with this, but it doesn't look like your website uses any JS so I would save that for later, when you are more comfortable with web dev.


Also in case you didn't know, if you're using the debugging tool on your web browser, you can see what your website would look like on any screen size and you can even simulate phones!

The benefit of using a site builder is that you don't have to know code to build your site. The downside is that you're stuck with whatever templates/themes/plugins or whatever that they make available to you.

If you're building your website yourself by writing the code, you can pretty much have anything you want on your site. So the benefit of coding the site yourself is primarily the flexibility it gives you. Downside is you've got to spend quite a bit of time learning how to code.

jgierer12,"Generally, it's common practice to load CSS and JS in separate files. This becomes increasingly efficient the more individual pages/routes you have using the same stylesheet and/or script (e.g. in a blog):

Instead of having to load the whole stylesheet and script on every page load, the browser only has to download it once and cache it to reuse it later. This will save you and the user a lot of bandwidth at the cost for just 2 additional requests, which usually is a good trade-off. Of course, this depends heavily on the actual size of your JS/CSS files and the number of pages an individual user views.

What your PageSpeed warning means is that you may want to inline the JS and CSS for *above-the-fold content* (i.e. content that is visible without scrolling), and loading the remaining code after rendering the DOM. This can be done by using the `defer` attribute on the `<script>` tag for JS, and injecting the additional CSS dynamically using JavaScript.

In most cases organization and not having too much duplicate code is going to be more important to your work than tiny performance boosts. Many pages on the web now load an excessive amount of resources (30-40+) so if you're under 15 you're probably in the clear.


There's really a lot of things you can do for optimization, and despite what PageSpeed says, those suggestions may not be relevant unless you really need to crank out every millisecond of performance for large projects.

 https://jsfiddle.net/0gxw2o7f/1/

A couple of other things - if you open the original fiddle - there is a syntax error where the #topbar div closes - you had a wild < character in there, so it was trying to open a new tag.

You can use sites like placeholder.com or placekitten.com as image placeholders - this will help you see where images actually are.

CSS-wise:

Look into 'resetting' css - browsers add their own 'default' stylings (such as margin and padding) - a popular reset stylesheet is https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/

Unless you want to style all types of an element, give it a class, ID, or reference it's parent element - for example, you'd added some padding to all img tags - when it looks like you only wanted to do it to the one in the sidebar. You could have given it a selector, or done #sidebar img (which is what I did because I'm lazy). If there was another img in #sidebar, that would adopt the same stylings if you used the code I did.

You seem to be using id and class in a lot of different situations. Whilst there's nothing *wrong* with that per-se, you might find it gets a bit confusing on larger projects. My rule of thumb is that anything that doesn't need styling doesn't get a selector, anything I'm using once but needs styling (for example an H1 that I need to be bigger than normal) gets an id, anything that is being used more than once on a page gets a class.

Lastly - and again - whilst there's absolutely nothing wrong with what you're doing at the moment - html 5 brought in a bunch of new, more descriptive elements - so instead of doing 

    <div class=""footer""></div>

You could have just done 

    <footer></footer>

Off the top of my head, there are also header, nav, and aside tags you might have wanted to use. https://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/html5/new-tags-in-html5.html seems to have a list. Nothing wrong with your way - just thought you might be interested to learn about the new elements.",1518508200.0

Keep a list of particles, and when the image changes assign each new base locations based on the new shape and add/remove particles as necessary (it looks like this happens on the mouse cursor here). Then the loop and smoothing will move them fluidly to their new place.

You can do some cool animation by adding and smooting extra values in the calculations, to simulate forces acting on the particles. (like adding more offset if mouse button is pressed, or animate the aiming point if the mouse is not moving).

The first step is to lower your expectation. It usually takes more than basic html and basic css to design a theme.

Next is focusing on one thing at a time. If you think tumblr is fun for you, then focus on that first.

Free template is your friend. Download a simple one and study the codes. Explore what the dev use to create such template. Your first template doesn't have to come 100% from you.

Explore framework. Framework is basically the basic mold of a website. It already halfway complete so you doesn't need  to spend days just to start with a one page template.

Last but not least, dive into UI/UX stuff. The feedback of elements in your page. What happen when user click this, or move mouse there. This require you to go deeper into js and css.

Best of luck~

lrm212,"> Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it's decoration. - Jeffrey Zeldman (www.zeldman.com)

I find that many beginners get hung up on trying to design without a specific problem or without the proper amount of content to solve that problem. So I'd suggest giving yourself a design problem to solve and creating a good amount of content for it. Then start thinking about the design to that specific situation. Once you've solved that you can try to abstract that design into a more general template.

You're realy talking about a design process. Mu approach is that design is thinking and thinking is hard. I usually start with a hand-sketched flowchart, many some hand-drawn wireframes and lots of lists (features, functionality, how I want to organize the content (categories, tags, archives, etc). And expressive words that describe how the site feels (not what it looks like). Then I might go to a bunch of visual reference (magazines, images from the web, etc) and try to find forty or fifty images (or parts of images) that look to me the feelings that the words describe. I find that very often I'll discard some of the images that don't fit with the other but creating a collage of these images (a moodboard) will often reveal palette, typography and to some extent flow.

In the old days I would have then gone to photoshop and started merging the work from the moodboard with the wireframes. But with the advent of a mobile first design approach I will typically jump right into HTML/CSS and start laying out the page for the phone. I find this a much faster way to quickly try things than Photoshop (but depending on your skills, your mileage may vary). 

So don't give up on HTML/CSS just yet. ",1517424198.0

You don't download a language - you learn its vocabulary, language and syntex and in the case of HTML you (typcially) use it to markup content for the web or apps.

lrm212,"Since you're just starting out with HTML let's point your in the right direction. I'm going to assume that you'd like to write well-formed, semantic, valid HTML markup using current best practices. You might find 10up's (www.10up.com) best practices on markup a [good starting point](https://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/markup/#top):

> ""Principles

> Markup is intended to define the structure and outline of a document and to offer semantic structure for the 
> document’s contents. Markup should not define the look and feel of the content on the page beyond the most 
> basic structural concepts such as headers, paragraphs, and lists.""

In a nutshell valid markup is markup that conforms to the current W3C(https://www.w3.org/) or (https://whatwg.org/) HTML standard. There has been great debate over the years if the time and effort to make your markup valid is worth the effort but with the advent of the HTML 5 standard that argument seems to have subsided a bit. And in any case it is a useful way for someone like yourself who is just starting out to learn by correcting your errors

You can find a HTML validator [here](https://validator.w3.org/). Running you markup through the validator reveals 1 warning and 14 errors( some of which have been already mentioned here)

Some basic comments:
As the 10up principles suggest markup is for organizing your content into a logical structure (CSS is for how is should look). Additionally you can use markup to describe the content and in fact the markup in the head element is reserved for meta information or information about the document content.

You have you head element with a title element which is good but you should also have at the very least a meta charset element. You can read more about meta tags at: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp and other important meta tags at: https://www.1and1.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/the-most-important-meta-tags-and-their-functions/

Moving on to the body - your markup is a mixture of modern semantic HTML (i.e. the use of nav elements) and a fair amount of out-dated techniques (br tags instead or p tags for individual paragraph, div tags instead of sections, tables for formatting, the lack for figure and figcaption tabs around captioned images and inline styling). So let's get started.

Your use of the nav elements for your navigation is great, but best practice is that navigation should be thought of as basically a list of links so your individual links should be marked up as a li elements within a ul element as follows:

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href=""./index.html"">Main</a></li>
            <li><a href=""./albums.html"">Albums</a></li>
            <li><a href=""./contact.html"">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

I'll leave the markup of the other nav as an exercise for you, but it should follow the same format.

(A quick aside: text should always be entered in proper case with initial caps as appropriate.  Remember presentation goes in CSS. If you want something to be all upper case use text-transform: uppercase in your CSS.https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-transform.asp).

In your content in all cases the double br tags should be replaced by a close and open p tag so that things like this:

    <p>
        In September 1963, ...
        including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, Ike & Tina Turner and Jackie Wilson.
    <br />
    <br /> In January 1964, feeling he had outgrown the circuit artistically, ...
        which he readily accepted.
    <br />
    <br />
    </p>

become this:

    <p>
        In September 1963, ...
        including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, Ike & Tina Turner and Jackie Wilson.
    </p>
    <p>
        In January 1964, feeling he had outgrown the circuit artistically, ...
        which he readily accepted
    </p>

Images with a caption should use the figure and figcaption tags so that things like this:

    <a>
    <img src=""https://graphics.ink19.com/issues/july2003/hendrixEarly.jpeg"" width=""400px"" />
    <div style='width: 380px; text-align: center;'>Hendrix performing with other musicians before fame.</div>
    </a>

become this:

    <figure>
        <a><img src=""https://graphics.ink19.com/issues/july2003/hendrixEarly.jpeg"" width=""400px"" /></a>
        <figcaption style='width: 380px; text-align: center;'>Hendrix performing with other musicians before fame.</figcaption>
    </figure>


and futhermore the image width and can be set with CSS (width is presentation) and although in this case, the figcaption element somewhat precludes the necessity of an alt tag, best practice is that you should include it (and for images without a caption the alt tag becomes a necessity for accessibility (for some exceptions and edges cases see: https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/). Additionally although you are using CSS to style your caption you're much better of doing it a style element in the head element of your document or in an external CSS file (http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/adding-css-to-html-with-link-embed-inline-and-import).

so we can refine the above to this:

    <figure>
        <a><img src=""https://graphics.ink19.com/issues/july2003/hendrixEarly.jpeg"" alt=""Hendrix performing with other musicians before fame."" /></a>
        <figcaption>Hendrix performing with other musicians before fame.</figcaption>
    </figure>

Also as has already been mentioned IDs and classes can't have spaces in them so this:

    <div id=""Early Years"">

should be:

    <div id=""EarlyYears""> or
    <div id=""Early-Years""> or
    <div id=""Early_Years"">

And remember ids and classes are case sensitive when you target them in CSS so this:

    <div id=""Early-Years"">
is not the same as this:

    <div id=""early-years"">
and in fact lower case with dashes if often used for id's and classes in markup.

Finally your div elements should probably be section elements so that in all cases things like this:

    <div id=""Humble Beginnings"">
        ...
    </div

become:

    <section id=""humble-beginnings"">
        ...
    </section>

Some CSS
Now let's add a little CSS is a style element inside your head element like this:

    <style>
        body {
            margin: 5% auto;
            background: #fcfcfc;
            color: #444444;
            font-family: Georgia, serif;
            font-size: 16px;
            line-height: 1.8;
            max-width: 73%;
        }

        a {
            border-bottom: 1px solid #444444;
            color: #444444;
            text-decoration: none;
        }

        a:hover {border-bottom: 0;}

        nav ul {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: start;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            text-transform: uppercase;
        }

        ul.page-nav {justify-content: center; }

        nav li {
            list-style: none ;
            padding: 0 1em;
        }

        .site-nav li {padding-left: 0;}

        figure {
            width: 50%;
            max-width: 414px;
          }

        figure a {border: none;}

        figcaption {
            font-size: 90%;
            text-align: center;
      }

       figure image {width: 100%}
    </style>


CSS notes:
 - the margin will pull the content from the edge of the browser and the auto will horizontally center it

 - I think Georgia is a better serif font than Times New Roman and it was designed for screen rather that print display

 - Giving the lines more air between them makes for easier legibilty

 - You usually want to set some kind of max-width on you page because your text will look ridiculous and will be hard to read on very wide monitors when the viewport is 100% of the screen size [see this stackover answer for more info](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/3618/ideal-column-width-for-paragraphs-online)

 - You should absolutely spend some time reading up on display:flex as it will solve many layout situations for you. 

 - In general is is a good idea to avoid pure white (#fff) for the body background color and pure black (#000) for the text color.

 - Using border-bottom to underline the links allows you to control the amount of separation between the text and the underline.

chrisgaraffa,"I noticed that if I clicked the Cancel button, the registration form disappeared. So I looked at that button in Chrome's Dev Tools, which hides the element with an id of `id01`

Your div with that ID (`<div id=""id01"" class=""modal"">`) doesn't have any styles on it to tell it to be hidden. That's why it shows up.

A few other notes:

• `id01` doesn't tell me (or you) anything. Maybe rename that to `registration-form-container` or something.    
• Rather than set the element's `style.display` to `none`, you should add a new class in your CSS - maybe it's called `hidden`. So you have in your CSS file `.hidden { display: none; }` and then your div to be hidden becomes `<div id=""registration-form-container"" class=""modal hidden"">`. Finally, the Cancel button would trigger the following JavaScript instead: `document.getElementById('registration-form-container').classList.remove('hidden');`    
• Speaking of JavaScript, don't put JavaScript inline. Either create a new .js file and reference it in `<script src=""/whatever.js""></script>` or put it in between `<script>` and `</script>` tags. To achieve the same effect, here's the relevant code:

    document.querySelectorAll('.cancelbtn')[0].addEventListener('click', function() {

Modifying the history is new to HTML5, and pushState() is a simple js function that let's you change the displayed URL as long the new URL that you're showing the user is still within the same domain.

woubuc,"Back in the day, there was no css yet, and the only way to format your webpage was through tags like `<font>` or `<blink>`. There were different versions of html and xhtml, and you had to tell the browser which exact version of which standard your webpage used, by adding a long and weird looking doctype declaration to your page. 

Then html5 came, and it made the html standard a lot more semantic, giving more meaning to tags and dropping the styling aspect almost completely (adding tags like `<em>` for emphasis instead of `<i>` for italic). In the context of html5 being more semantic, pretty much all elements that were only used for styling (like `<font>`) were removed from the standard. They also dropped all the annoying doctype declarations and replaced them with the ""one true"" html doctype, which will include support for new html features as they are added in the future. 

Of course, this is the web we're talking about, and lots of sites are still using old (x)html versions and thus use the older tags and doctypes. So browsers still support a lot of the tags that were deprecated with html5. This is fine for old websites that haven't been updated (because without backwards compatibility half the web would break), but any new html code you write should only use modern tags supported by the html5 standard.",1515770128.0
icantthinkofone,"The current HTML standard is ""HTML5.2"" which was just ""approved"" a few days ago by the W3C but browser vendors follow WHATWG. That should add to your confusion. Please note that W3Schools is not related to the W3C in any way, shape or form. You can use them for quick examples but they are not the standard. You eventually need to be able to read the standard and follow that.

When the standard says something is deprecated, it means that sometime in the future, that elements will be removed from the standard and you should find some other element to use in its place. In the future, that element will join the list of obsolete elements which have been removed. That does not mean that browsers won't support those elements and their tags but you are being warned that they may stop working in a browser without any notice.

`<!DOCTYPE html>` is a Document Type Declaration. It has a long complicated past. Today it indicates to a browser you are using the current standard (standards mode) for HTML in your document (web page). There is no number used in that declaration.

If a doctype isn't present, or is malformed, then the browser will assume you want to be in ""quirks mode"", another long complicated history I don't feel like going into now. Suffice to say, you never want to be in quirks and the very first thing to put on any web page is a doctype before you do anything else.",1515787981.0
brvtalbadger,"The way I learned how to design is mainly by looking at other popular websites (google, Facebook, Twitter, Forbes, YouTube, whatever you want really), and seeing first what I liked about them, then talking to other people about them and what they like, dislike, don’t even notice.  

The likes are usually quite consistent and are markers of things that I might want to replicate, where things they dislike and don’t notice are good feedback on how to declutter a design and identify areas for improvement.

Also there’s loads of beautiful templates out there, both free and premium, so have a look for some in a range of industries and see what commonalities, differences, plugins, etc there are and from that you can build what’s essentially a style guide for various contexts.",1515742135.0

hed-y,"I helped a class mate who had this problem recently.  My suggestions are as follows:

1. Check out webstyleguide.com , it’s a free online book with a ton of information.  Glance through it, specifically the parts about color, typography, and white space.

2. The elements of design are texture, color, value, size, line, space and shape.  You should try to incorporate all of these in your sites, but typically you want to focus on just one.  For example, if focusing on texture you would put a lot of photos with varying amounts of noise.

3.  Make a list of sites that you enjoy using for one reason or another. Write dow which are your favorite parts of the site and which elements of design they use.

4. Create a series of simple one or two page sites using the elements that you liked from step 3.  Make sure to draw wire frames first!  This is super important even if they’re just dumb little stick figure type drawings, because it helps you figure out how you want it to look without frustrating yourself with bad code.  Here is an example of a wireframe I did.  They don’t need to be fancy.      https://imgur.com/gallery/CQODC

5.  Rebuild websites you hate the design of - make them your own!  If you want it to be technicolor do it, just make it usable.  

6.  Don’t get too frustrated with design.  Ask yourself if you like that aspect of web development.  If the answer is no then create a life for yourself that doesn’t require it!  

Best of luck and I hope this helps!

I would recommend learning CSS Grid it makes laying out webpages much easier and can be used with or without flexbox.

Also avoid learning jQuery and stick to Vanilla JS, it might seem tempting to switch at first but plain JS provides a much better foundation of learning, especially if you go on to learn NodeJS.

Also learn on more than one training platform, mix courses like FreeCodecamp and Treehouse with a course on Udemy, FCC and Treehouse teach is a sandbox environment whereas Udemy videos are easier to follow from your computer and show you what software to use/download. So it’s good to have both the sandbox and local computer environments for learning, they complement well.

thequargy,"The `<form>` will direct the user to the page specified in the `action` parameter, or, if there is none, it'll refresh. Since you did `method=""get""`, it will also change the querystring to be the results of this `<form>`, regardless of what was there before.

So you have two options.

**Option 1**: include a pre-filled input, `<input type=""text"" name=""name"" value=""John"">`, and hide it with `display: none;`. If this has to be dynamic and pull from the querystring, you'll need to include a `<script>` to populate that input.

**Option 2**: override the default behavior of the `<form>` submit: `<form action=""javascript:;"" onsubmit=""someFunction();"">`. Then you can manipulate the querystring in your form submit handler function and redirect the user wherever you want (`window.location = ""person.php?name=...`).",1513097178.0

That can be client projects, personal projects, even tutorials if you have to - but if you have no code to your name, I doubt you'll get an interview.
