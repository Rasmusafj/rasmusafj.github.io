chrisgseaton,"I don't think such a feature exists. A feature to allow broken code in the code tree doesn't sound like great software engineering to me, personally, and the Maven engineers may think the same way and so not want to enable that kind of thing. Can you just move the file out of the way until it's done? Or \`git stash\` it?",1543626479.0
oldprogrammer,"Likely what is happening is the difference in a build tool versus the compiler.  The Java compiler knows that when a single file that it is processing references another class, it has to search to find that class.  If the second class isn't found but the source file its, the javac will compile the second file.  So only files/classes the object graph being compiled are considered.

Tools like Maven and Ant, however, locate all *.java source files in the source subdirectory then determine if the compiled .class file exists or is older than the latest source file change and any that fall into that category are sent to be compiled.  ",1543602604.0
pron98,"The C2 compiler actually does vectorize, but not in this particular case of a sequential sum, where the optimization was [specifically disabled](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8078563), as it was deemed not beneficial enough; re-enabling it is an [open issue](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8188313). See [this talk](https://youtu.be/0yrBuPiGk8I) for a comparison of C2 and clang optimizations.",1543591219.0
BenoitParis,"> So it's an issue of the optimizer; as is often the case, it unrolls too aggressively and shoots itself in the foot, all the while missing out on various other opportunities.

Feels like a good case for ML-optimized optimizers. This summer Jeff Dean (at Google) talked about was a database index that used machine learning to guess approximately which memory block to look for, and then search around what it found. He added that every place where we have heuristics could benefit from ML.

This optimizer case seems a great opportunity to apply the same principle.",1543604121.0

marek1840,"First - compiled to bytecode.
Then - interpreted by the jvm.
Finally (optionally) - compiled to machine code during runtime (google JIT compiler ) ",1543529720.0
locatedtaco,"As other people have mentioned, it's actually a complicated question, and the answer of ""kind of both"" isn't really useful in most situations.  From just an everyday Java programmer perspective , I think the simplest answer is to just say:  Java is a compiled language.  This implies two main things:  First, you have to recompile your source code to make any changes to your runtime code.  Second, the compiler can and will catch certain bugs before your run it, e.g. syntax errors, accessing variables outside of scope, using classes not loaded on the class path, etc.

Then, as an informed developer you should know how Java and the JVM works underneath like: what Java byte code is, how other languages like Scala and Groovy compile down to Java byte code, how the JVM may actually compile parts of your Java byte code or may run it ""interpretively"", how the JVM can support hot swapping of code.  Again, this stuff you won't use on a daily basis, but it's good to know in case you run into really tricky bugs, or just to help make an informed decision about your tech stack and tools.",1543533067.0
AmonDhan, Yes,1543529670.0
ruanmed,"It's compiled (using javac), to a lower level language which is called byte code (those are the .class files).
When you ""run"" the compiled files, which might be Java containers (aka .jar files, containing .class files), using the Java interpreter (using java) then it interprets and run the byte code on machine language.

TL;DR: It's compiled then interpreted.",1543529704.0
Roachmeister,"I have a different interpretation than others. I would say that there are two different programming languages that people often mistakenly conflate into one. They are Java and Bytecode.

Java is a one of many high-level languages that may be compiled to Bytecode. There are many others, such as Scala and Kotlin. But it is also possible (using Graal) to compile Java to native machine code. In either case, Java is always compiled.

Bytecode is machine code that runs, usually, on a virtual machine. I say usually because it can run natively on hardware. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_processor) for more info. When it runs on a VM, it could be said to be interpreted, although as others pointed out, some JVMs compile it on the fly into native code.

I make these distinctions because we often speak sloppily about ""running"" Java. It is impossible to run a Java file. It must first be compiled into another language, Bytecode, and then we ""run"" that. (By the way, it is entirely possible to write a program directly in Bytecode without it ever being Java or any other language, just as it is possible to write a program in assembly).",1543541193.0
TheRedmanCometh,"So I'm gonna add a bit to what everyone else is saying because they say WHAT is going on but not why. So as others have said java is first compiled into Java Bytecode which is halfway between readable code and machine code. Then the JVM takes that code and in *real time ish* translates it into machine code. Now the reason it does that is a key part of what makes Java so great. The JVM has instructions on how to translate that bytecode into APPROPRIATE machine code for a given JVM installation. So if I have a Linux JVM it turns that JAR into very different code than it does on Windows or Mac. 

So that's why Java will run anywhere you can put a JVM. ",1543538692.0
nutrecht,Aside from what others have said; there are very few languages used in production that are actually purely interpreted. Languages like JavaScript and Python are generally also JIT compiled or use an intermediate step. Line-by-line interpretation like used in the good old QuickBasic days (or like in bash scripts) is just too slow. ,1543561134.0
suryarose,"Java is a compiled programming language, but rather than compile straight to executable machine code, it compiles to an intermediate binary form called JVM byte code. The byte code is then compiled and/or interpreted to run the program.",1543855570.0
_ramsey_,"Runtime compiled. Most(?) compiled languages are build time compiled.

If you ahead of time (AOT) compile something at build time, you can't make the same sort of optimizations you can with just in time (JIT) compile. JIT can be faster than AOT as a result. Since it is runtime compiled though, JIT tends to have slower starts and a warm up period before getting optimal results.

Interpreters do not compile. The advantage of interpreters is that code can be changed at runtime with no recompiling needed. They continue to re-interpret over and over again, which is why they are slower to execute than compiled code. 

Interpretation is why LISP or JS can do eval() and just execute a string of code. In Java, you need to generate the source strings, then run them through the compiler, and then feed the bytecode into a classloader before you can dynamically create a program.

Each approach has tradeoffs. Java typically is JIT compiled, but Java 11 comes with jaotc to do AOT compiled applications as well. Java also has a built in JavaScript interpreter and jshell, so you really get all three with Java.",1543534830.0

haloddr,"Hey, good question!  I have somewhat of a different perspective from most people.  I really dislike most of the major frameworks b/c they feel big and bloated.   However, just using raw JDBC is pretty dirty - just to do a simple DB query you have to catch all kinds of checked exceptions.  I created a little wrapper around JDBC which cleans it up.  It only contains 3 java files - it is incredibly light-weight and easy to use.  [https://github.com/mirraj2/EZDB](https://github.com/mirraj2/EZDB)

&#x200B;

Then, to organize my code, I have a package called ""models"" which contains java classes like ""User"", ""Session"", etc.  I have a package called ""db"" which contains a matching DB class for each model I want to store in a table.  So, ""UserDB"", ""SessionDB"", etc.    It is up to each of those DB classes to contain the logic which uses the EZDB library to query the database.

cypher0six,"I like to use raw JDBC when I can get away with it. I'm not sure what you mean by ""examples on the strategy"", so I'll show you a bit about how I handle things in code.

I'll usually have some kind of Repository or DAO to hide the fact that these objects are stored in a database. Something like:

    PersonRepo {
        void add(Person person);
        void remove(Person person);
        List<Person> findLike(Person person);
        List<Person> findWithName(String name);
    }

Inside those methods is where I'll do the JDBC work. The code structure of the methods look a little different depending on language level of the project. The below is common for the Java 6 projects I work on. On Java 7 and 8 projects, you can use things like try-with-resources and lambdas to simplify the code a bit, but it's generally the same.

    public List<Person> findWithName(String name) {
    
        final List<Person> people = new ArrayList<Person>();
        final Connection connection;
        final PreparedStatement statement;
        final ResultSet results;
        final String sql;
    
        try {
            sql = ""select * from people where name like ?"";
            connection = dataSource.getConnection();
            final PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
            statement.setString(1, name);
            results = statement.executeQuery();
    
            while (results.next()) {
                // get results and populate list
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            log.error(""Unable to query database!"", e);
            throw new IllegalStateException(""Unable to query database!"", e);
        } finally {
            try {
                results.close();
                statement.close();
                connection.close();
            } catch (SQLException f) {
                log.debug(""Unable to close connection. It may have already been closed, or was never opened."", f);
            }
        }
    
        return people;
    }

The above was written from memory, but serves as a rough example of how I use JDBC directly.

One thing that is missing in this example is how you get a database connection. In EE/Spring applications, you can inject one or more DataSource instances. Or you can just use dependency injection via a constructor or setter method. Or the static factory thing. Or something else I am not thinking of. That decision depends on how you need to handle database connections, and your preferred means of passing around dependencies.",1543444343.0
2bdb2,"I wouldn't recommend using JDBC directly. There's some excellent libraries that iron out the warts while still giving you direct control over the query.

If Scala is an option for you, then `Doobie` is hands down the best JDBC abstraction I've used. It can type-check your SQL Strings at compile time against a real SQL database, and provide type-safe and mostly automatic marshalling and unmarshalling to your data types.

There's also a number of really good ""Query Builders"" that let you build SQL Queries using a ""Language Integrated"" syntax. It's not raw SQL, but it's fairly thin abstraction.

JOOQ is quite good for this in Java. There's also Quill and Slick for the Scala ecosystem.

audioen,"I have implemented a class called CRUD that serves as a simplistic ORM. My preferred style for a database hosted domain object is a naked struct, no methods on it whatsoever, just public members that exactly correspond with columns in database class. Here are some API examples, these would literally work assuming a class Foo with fields Long id and Integer xyz:

Create object;

    Foo foo = new Foo();
    foo.xyz = 5;
    CRUD.persist(handle, foo); // does INSERT INTO foo (xyz) values (?), gets the ID, updates foo.id

Update object:

    // does SELECT * FROM foo WHERE id = ?
    foo = CRUD.select(handle, Foo.class, fooId);
    foo.xyz = 6;
    // does UPDATE foo SET xyz = ? WHERE id = ?
    CRUD.persist(handle, foo);

Delete object:

    // does DELETE FROM foo WHERE id = ?
    CRUD.delete(handle, foo);

Foreign keys are just Long fields that reference the target entity. The reason I use Long is not because I expect to have over 4 billion of them, I just find it helpful to have rarely used numeric type stand for IDs, as it avoids mixing any other type of number with an ID. I don't mind the extra 4 bytes of storage it takes on DB.

The implementation of CRUD basically uses reflection to scan the object, identifies the ID column from annotation, treats all the rest as regular columns, and finally generates the relevant SQL statements. persist() is has a little bit intelligence in that it determines whether to update or insert based on the contents of the ID field: If the value is null then it issues an insert and collects the ID value database assigned into the ID field. Otherwise it issues an update (and checks that the update did hit a row in DB).

Because the CRUD must read all the fields and write all the fields at once, I use SERIALIZABLE transactions to avoid lost update issues, e.g. the sequence of select-modify-update can race with other transactions attempting the same thing. Commit failures require that any transactions may be attempted multiple times, so the code within transaction must be side-effect free and as short in duration as possible.

My code actually doesn't quite run on top of raw JDBC, but it's fairly close. I use a library called JDBI that provides all the mapping capabilities between ResultSet and my domain object representations. Those mappings, however, wouldn't be too difficult to write yourself, if you wanted to.

JDBI also has an approach for DAOs where you can declare SQL statements into an interface with annotations like @SqlQuery, and JDBI generates usable class at runtime from the definition with support for binding variables to placeholders in the query. That kind of stuff helps avoid mixing raw SQL into your program. Still, I find that reports and some API calls tend to have no single canned statement to execute, and that you do need to construct the SQL statement text within the method. For all such statements, you'd also want to use placeholders with a :fooId type syntax to avoid SQL injection.

I also declare a lot of result classes that 1:1 match the projections from SQL statements. These are often used just to carry the result out of a method, or get converted to JSON in case it's some kind of API call.",1543384171.0

I would’ve much rather implemented a Kafka stream but alas, the other team involved thought that was too much work. Anyways. JPA/Hibernate were much too slow for what I needed.

You write Foo.Bar but that's just because java recognizes the reference to the inner class and pretends very hard that there is a genuine relationship between the inner and outer class. However, you might just as well have the static inner class in a separate file altogether.

Static inner classes are useful for declaring multiple public classes or interfaces in a single file, something that Java normally disallows.

Yes, you'll have to spend time on it.  If someone submits a change set spread across two dozen files then it's going to be difficult to reason about, so encourage small reviews.

washtubs,"I think that depends on what you consider your resposibility, or better, what you would like your responsibility to be. Do you want to be able to maintain any subsystem with ease?

Or do you want to be responsible for the quality of the overall product and be someone who's word means something and gives confidence to your higher ups?

Knowing your goals should drive your priorities in code review. They will guide what you focus on, but in general, yes absolutely you should be looking for bugs during code review.

My approach is a bit more rigorous and in the weeds than others here would prefer, I imagine, and I also don't get the benefit of making people write unit tests to help me understand their changes, so keep that in mind. I absolutely wish I could just tell people to write tests, but I'm not the boss. :)

1. **Assess whether the change set solves the problem specified in the ticket**. This can involve building and testing empirically. Basically, see if anything got lost in translation. This is absolutely the first thing you should do before diving into the code.
2. **Familiarize yourself with the general layout of the changes.** 
3. **Determine any areas that are scary, and try to understand what the author is trying to do**. Unexpected complexity often means the author is accounting for an edge case you hadn't considered. But it can be a number of things. Taking a moment to try to understand what the author is doing before asking them better prepares you to talk to them about their change. Make comments in the PR to confirm your understanding with the author. This is also a great time to ask for specific documentation. At this point, if they passed part 1, you should not have tried to make any meaningful criticisms, yet.

Now that you have a 60-80% understanding of the change set compared to the author, there are lots of options available:

1. **Attempt to find bugs based on issues and smells you noticed in the code**. Report the bug, and say what lead you to it. This educates people, and makes them more likely to listen to you when you say something is a smell with no corresponding ""bug"".
2. **Critique the salient issues**. Filter out all the nitty gritty stuff, and identify issues that are the most problematic. Then discuss them. What is most salient is informed by your priorities. Does the change harm your ability to maintain this system, or integrate some feature? Is something prone to break with future maintenance due to some gotcha?
3. **Comment on something you like and would like to see more of**. This is such a painfully neglected type of feedback. It is very important that when people are doing something right, you don't let them un-train themselves. Letting them know that good work done without fanfare is not unnoticed. That is invaluable. And goes without saying, it generally makes people happier which is an end in itself.

Always give generalizable feedback, i.e. don't go off of whims. Never ask someone to change something unless you can tell them why and when they should apply your rule.

Often rules, like style rules can either be documented in a wiki or enforced with linters and static code analyzers. Obviously the latter is preferable when possible.

Last, **if time permits**, give ""clean code"" feedback. Stuff that doesn't matter for functionality / performance, but makes the code less intimidating to look at and more respectable.",1543383068.0

Implementations often have signals and code smells, but in the workplace there are usually intermediate steps between initial and ""good"" implementation.

aris_kourt,"Coming from a work environment where automated coverage tests are non existent (we still use black box testing methods) I can tell you that reviewing is more than essential to ensure the quality of our end result. With that in mind this is what I look for when reviewing in general:

1) How close is the submitted code to the original design and requirements.
2) Is it structurally and architecturally correct?
3) Does the code fit in our code standard criteria?
4) Is the submitted code maintainable? Can it be enriched to include tests (even though we don't actually use them we tend to write code with that in mind).
5) Are there any wrongdoings regarding code best practices? Any misuses of the tools supplied by the base JDK? This also applies for frameworks as well for example, when using Spring I check whether it's best practices are followed too.
6) Is the code submitted adhering to current development standards? For example we have s bunch of developers who still code using java 6 and earlier conventions while we formally code and deploy on 11. 
7) Are there noticeable side effects caused by the submitted code? We use our base product as a pass around fat jar on our other products as well (for me an extremely bad practice). So a simple change can have huge side effects on other products.

I mainly tend to cover the above points. I don't think that I'm missing any. Our team has around 20 developers out of which only 5 (myself included tend to perform code reviews). What I also tend to do, especially for newcomers but not only to them, is to provide reading material whenever possible (via means of doc links etc). 

This is done for two reasons. One to further support s review remark, two to have the person under review spend some time exploring the documentation with hopes of further reading.

In some cases, before starting the actual review and when time permits I tend to do a quick smoke test of the submitted code. There have been several cases where a submission has been failed from this.

Finally, reviews take time and need to be organized. I like to take my time and be very meticulous when reviewing. This means that I tend to ignore managers that want to push half finished software out on production just so that they can keep up with their schedule. If needed I also have a sit down with the developer to explain stuff, do some pair programming if I feel that something is perplexing them etc. Unless something's extremely urgent I have everyone respect the reviewing process and not try to push it.

* Integration Tests - check if individual units play nice together.  Test the API layer that connects components of the application.  Does each component produce the expected output for given inputs?  Run automatically by the build system.

Each of these things has to happen for every user story or defect that wants to enter production.  Some of this has to be done even for moves to test environments (these are different from dev environments btw).

> Make good use of Generic Types. Generics in Java can trace their orgins to Generic Java created by Philip Wadler (Haskell legend), Martin Odersky (creator of Scala), Gilad Bracha, Dave Stoutamire. Don’t ignore type parameters, declare them and enforce them everywhere. Minimize casting and if instanceOfing. Where you do use them (it is still Java after all — they are likely impossible to fully eliminate), centralize each type of cast within a resuable method, use proper type parameters on the inputs and outputs and write good tests!

> Make illegal states unrepresentable in our code. The Haskell and Idris compilers will enforce this for you, just pretend Javac is as strict. Avoid nulls, don’t throw Exceptions, avoid locking and synchronization and you will take giant leaps towards this.

> Make our own data classes immutable and final where possible, use immutable collections (proper ones). Avoid instanceof checks where possible, and where you use them make sure the types are not extensible.

> Use libraries that avoid runtime magic and reflection where pragmatically possible.

The server provides services which make it easier for you to write your application.  Certainly you can build an HTTP server into your application.

I get paid to build an accounting application not a web server.

Your entire build process can produce a single artifact:  the WAR file.  FoobarApp.war.

You can plug FoobarApp.war into any Java application server (Tomcat, Jetty, Wildfly, . . . others).  Those servers provide various standardized services that your application can use.  Session tracking with cookies.  Named resources -- where the values of those resource names can be changed in the server without altering the application.  Multiple applications hosted on a single server.  A single control panel (such as Tomcat's control panel) that lets you install, remove, start, stop individual applications.

I'm not trying to 'sell' you on an application server.  I'm merely pointing out that they provide a lot of services that you don't have to write yourself.

If you build HTTP into your application.  Are you going to FULLY implement all of HTTP?  Or just parts of it?  Will your implementation be as well tested for standards compliance, correctness, and security?  What about HTTPS?  All of the sophisticated crypto algorithms and machinery.  And it is a moving target!  What about HTTP/2 ?  What about virtual hosts where multiple domain names are hosted on a single IP?  Tomcat, and others, already do all of this and more.  You can tell tomcat how many spare threads it should have listening for incoming requests -- without altering your application.  Tomcat gives you choices of which ""connectors"" you might want to use -- configured in the server.xml file, outside of your application.  Your application doesn't care how the plumbing works.  Another brand of server might implement it very differently -- but the interfaces are all the same and your compiled application file just plugs in.

In theory, with the best JIT optimization possible, the `list.forEach()` version should be the fastest, as the List implementation itself can optimize out some sanity checks and unnecessary virtual calls.

That's not the only reasons for using an in-memory database. The main reason I use hsqldb during tests is because it reduces the complexity of setting up and configuring a clean database for testing purposes. An in-JVM database engine reduces complexity to zero, and any developer can run the tests without any set up.

I guess it is much easier (and cheaper) to deploy a postreSQL cluster with WAL than to handcraft every sql query.",1543229848.0
audioen,"I regard my choice of using Hibernate the biggest mistake in my professional career. Here is a list of pain points I have with it:

* doesn't properly map names of columns (java fooBar = SQL foo_bar) or changes in @Column annotations and similar to database tables. E.g. if you make a varchar longer by changing the length attribute, it isn't smart enough to compare that to the current schema and alter it. Ditto for changes in nullability. So you'll have to keep track of stuff like that and alter it yourself.
* once Hibernate changed the way it names indexes and duplicated all the indexes in every table in every database that I ran it on. Gee, thanks a lot for not bothering with writing any migration code to rename the old indexes, instead preferring to just double the cost of index updates and storage. This also happened for all foreign key constraints. IIRC the difference was literally between adding or removing an underscore in the database object name, something it could have detected and migrated by itself if it had been written by a responsible person.
* tendency to select the entire world in @ManyToOne, unless you make some kind of global decisions about which things you want to fetch and not fetch, e.g. FetchType.LAZY helps some queries but then harms others. You may be doing something like `entityManager.find(Foo.class, fooId)` just to print the name field of Foo, but this gets all the EAGER things too. Someone once said that in OO world, you just wanted a banana, but you end up with gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle. That's Hibernate right there.
* for some crazy reason Hibernate defaults to the model of just doing 1 select to get all your data, regardless of the kinds of joins that are involved, and that may cause huge number of rows to be fetched from database after a few OneToMany associates are fetched from multiple contexts. I once made user permissions an eagerly fetched OneToMany field, and as users are involved in all database actions, and were eagerly fetched due to being ManyToOne, then all those permissions multiplied even modest numbers of result rows several hundred times. One query had a final result set of 100 rows but Hibernate, in the background, processed something like 17 million ResultSet rows to make those 100 entities. I realize the problem might not be easy to solve in general case, but surely something better than this exists.
* additionally, trying to do join fetch things ""from foo select foo join fetch foo.bar"", ends up duplicating the ""foo"" records, because Hibernate seems to not really understand what you want to achieve with a join fetch. Needing to put a distinct there is an ancient, well-known wart of this technology.
* not doing join fetch when required is the difference between getting something done in 1 second instead of 1 minute or even 1 hour. It is seriously important to avoid the 1+N select pattern, but Hibernate makes it invisible when it happens. E.g. you might only want the ID of a foreign key which it already has, so you do foo.getBar().getId() but this already triggers the fetch for the entire Bar. (I think. I have seen code in the hibernate object proxy that suggests this should not happen, so maybe I'm wrong.) The only clue that you will see is really low performance of some part of application.
* making LOBs lazy didn't seem to not make Hibernate fetch all of them anyway. The only solution is to put LOBs into separate tables altogether.
* writing @Column instead of @JoinColumn and storing an entity there may actually cause Hibernate to use java serialization to write it into database. This is really nasty failure mode in that it can be invisible to you when it happens, but the clue is that you end up with a bytearray column in DB when you look there, and have extremely low performance and seemingly inconsistent records in database. Using serialization like this is somewhere between misguided and dangerous, and the code should be backed out or put behind feature flag, never enabled by default.
* investing in some intelligence in alias naming would reduce the query length greatly. You will easily get literal pagefuls of crap like this if you dump the SQL hibernate spews:

       workorderl0_.product_id as product_9_43_0_, workorderl0_.purchaseOrderNumber as purchase3_43_0_, workorderl0_.qualityGrade as qualityG4_43_0_, workorderl0_.quantityCancelled as quantity5_43_0_,

  This is just so damn verbose, and makes debugging performance issues extra annoying. A human would rename entity WorkOrderLine as ""wol"", maybe. Hell, I could live with the tables being called ""t1"", ""t2"", but I absolutely hate seeing workorderl0\_, and the result column names are pretty damn annoying, too.

The thing with Hibernate is that you can probably fix most of these problems if you hand-hold it enough, but the default behaviors seem to be pretty poorly chosen. If you think smart technology should help you, and protect you against mistakes you might be making, and have good defaults, then I think you'll be rather disappointed with Hibernate.

I no longer use Hibernate in new projects, and have converted some projects away from Hibernate. In the end, I write the exact projection SQLs I need by hand, and map that to precise classes that have just the fields the projection results into. I also have small utility classes to help me generate CRUD statements out of POJOs, and finally some stuff that can convert POJOs to database table definitions, taking into account changes in constraints, indexes, varchar lengths, and all the shit that Hibernate is incapable of doing correctly despite being like decades older.",1543244057.0
owen800q,"Dont be confused about performance of queries. because its the first time need. if you think about data cache is implemented by persistence providers (JPA) in order to improve performance by reducing accesses to the database data. Just think about When millions of users pretend to access the same row of a table they usually went to open a connection to the database and then the data was retrieved from the table, in this sense the database became a bottleneck for many applications; that is why data caching is of primary importance for new Web applications; in this sense, the Java Persistence API offers many possibilities to increase performance by means of using many distributed cache frameworks.

So if cache implemented then this query you are running wont take that much time on second request.

One thing I don't understand is the appeal of using annotations over XML. At my job, we've built a whole infrastructure of application components that can be interchanged. They all work in a pipeline structure, similar to chaining Unix commands. It's a great system - I can build an entire new application simply by creating a new XML configuration file. However, if I replaced the XML with annotations, I'd have to recompile everything. To me, having precompiled libraries that I link using Spring was the great thing about Spring; if I had to recompile every time, the advantages would be lost.

I have used the @Autowired annotation occasionally when there will clearly only ever be one implementation of an interface. 

Now, obviously Spring annotations are popular, so there must be use cases I'm missing.

My explanation is; A framework isn’t necessarily (or just) a library or collection of libraries.  Imagine a collection of libraries that are imported into and managed by some application (ie a framework) which your application depends on in some way.  

A good example is the Spring Framework.  Spring (through configuration) imports a number of external libraries (including some of its own).  Through Maven’s inheritance and dependency mechanisms, your application depends on the Spring framework which has pre-imported and pre-configured those libraries and given you an easy way to configure not only itself (Spring), but those other external libraries.

I can't recall ever using JNI to gain a performance advantage or access kernel libraries.  I also don't use JNI often enough but what I have to refresh my knowledge each time.  However, I have frequently encountered cases where libraries were available only in C or C++, n or they provided a Java wrapper API for only a very restricted set of functions.  I've probably had a need for JNI about once every half-dozen years; and ""need"" is a strong word, but I've scored points for being able to step up and do a job no one else was able to do.

Examples include accessing MS Excel and MS Word functionality only available via a C/C++ API initially, and the very popular FLEX License Manager, which only offers a Java wrapper API for the most basic licensing approach.  JNI is required for more flexibility.

Agreed re networking; the bulk of today's networking is handled by HTTP, or rather by even higher-level JavaScript constructs.  However, despite the volume of applications, HTTP is horribly inefficient for basic operations (which doesn't matter for many applications with today's network performance), but there are many applications outside of ""retail"" user interfaces and relatively lightweight client-server interactions where HTTP's performance overhead, developer complexity, and testing effort are unacceptable.

nutrecht,"I think it's incredibly obvious this article was written with a purpose; to tell the author that he is perfectly right in resisting the more functional approach many languages are taking. Every single argument in this post was just written with that in mind.

I hope that the author, someday, will actually start approaching 'new' stuff with an open mind instead of actively trying to resist change. I'm not saying all change is good, I'm saying that you should not start with the assumption that it's bad. Starting with the assumption its bad is the best way to make sure you come to a conclusion you want to come to.

That said; there are some issues I want to point out. First of all going for this:

    if(e % 2 == 2)
        result += e * 2;

Most linters will warn you against it by default. This is considered a bad practice for a reason; doing this makes it very easy to add a line to an if statement body and make the mistake of missing that there's no braces. Ending up with something like this:

    if(e % 2 == 2)
        result += e * 2;
        result -= 1;

It's easy to miss the mistake here. It's silly to be so concerned about the amount of lines of code; opening/closing braces is just a single line of code. Besides, the whole FP argument isn't about lines of code anyway.

Seondly; a lot of your arguments are based on that the FP approach is slower. The method call overhead in most situations is extremely tiny; I did a benchmark with a typical work load (such as mapping objects and creating JSON) and you can't tell the difference even in synthetic benchmarks. So if you're in a situation, like when you're dealing with large arrays of primitives; by all means use a for-loop for performance. No one is saying it should be your only tool. 

And frankly, the statement that *Stop developing software if you actually think any of this is true. Please.* is just ridiculously aggressive.

The moment you use language like that no one is going to be influenced by your post. You completely lost the readers. So now it's just a rant and rants are best written on paper and then burned. And frankly you should probably do the same with your post.

You have no streams/lambda examples in your post so it's clear that you haven't even given it a shot. Which is a shame. Because the industry in general is moving to a mixed OO/FP approach that Java (and Kotlin, heck, even Rust to some extent) support really well. ",1542960990.0

Whoever has written the article has no clue about standard compliant Java programming. 

Also, the code as such doesn't make any sense. The statement `(e % 2 == 2)` can never be true because the possible range for `% 2` is only `0` and `1`, never `2` because a division by 2 can never produce a remainder of 2.

Like, what was even with that ""spaghetti code"" example? How was the original spaghetti? And how does it help to remove a few redundant parens? Formatting isn't what makes code spaghetti, high coupling between modules is what makes code spaghetti. 

Now, I'm a huge functional programming fan, but that doesn't mean I reach for it all the time in Java. Sometimes it's useful, sometimes it's not. I tend to like FunctionalInterfaces, they help with wrapping up custom methods that can throw exceptions. I tend to like streaming for iterating over deeply nested structures. I also tend to write fairly stateless code, rarely do instance variables change after an object has been instantiated.

As an example, I recently had to write a lot of queries (~30-40) using hibernate over a fairly complex set of models. There was a lot of nesting, and in many places required some complicated traversal of the tree of objects to pull out the right info. In several of these queries, if I were to write them imperatively to build the list of results, there would be about 12 layers of for loops and ifs, but with streams using map, filter, and flatMap, it can be written much more cleanly, modified more easily, and with tools like Intellij, we don't have to guess the intermediate types because it's displayed inline automatically. For the simple queries a for loop or two would work just fine, but some of them really would have gotten out of hand written the more traditional way. Even the die hard antifunctional guy on my team had to agree after showing the two alternatives (which, you know, Intellij can switch between automatically anyway).",1542944648.0

RockMeetHardPlaces,"I made one for the last company I worked for.  I wish I had the source to reference, but it went something like this:


1. Create a set of interfaces that will be consumed by your primary application; Ideally these interfaces have zero dependencies.  (Optional: package this up as a separate .jar to be consumed by both the plugins created and the consumer)

2. When you create the interfaces, they should be ""callback-y"":

```java
    // ILoginPlugin is the interface your login plugins need to implement, IPlugin is just a marker interface for you to work with -- maybe add basic logging or something as default methods, w/e
    public interface ILoginPlugin extends IPlugin {
        boolean beforeLogin(String username, String password);
        boolean afterAuthentication(IUser authenticatedUserObject);
        String afterLogin(IUser authenticatedUserObject);
    }
```

3. In the above example, I've set up an interface that I'll use during my authentication process.  First thing I'll do, before any local authentication, is optionally auth against something else.  Maybe I want to always log someone in if they use the username ""demo"", maybe I want to check against a different authentication database, whatever.  The boolean returned could mean whatever you want it to mean.  In this example, I'll take it to mean, ""go ahead and consider them authenticated instead of checking the local database"".  It could just as easily be ""bail on authentication before checking"" -- it's your choice how it works.

4. Write some consumers for your interfaces:

```java
    public class LoginController {
        void doLogin(){
            // PluginFactory is something you'll write to manage the objects, reloading, etc of the plugins you use.  PluginFactory.get looks like this: <T extends IPlugin> get (Class<T> pluginClazz)...
            ILoginPlugin authPlugin = pluginFactory.get(ILoginPlugin.class);
            if(authPlugin.beforeLogin(username, password)  || localAuthMethod(username, password))
                User user = userService.load(username);
                if(!authPlugin.afterAuthentication(user)){
                  throw AuthFailedException(""Or whatever..."");
                }
                doOtherPostLoginStuffLoadingContextsOrWhatever();
                String placeToSendUser = authPlugin.afterLogin(user);
                postLoginRedirect(placeToSendUser == null ? 'loginPage.html' : placeToSendUser);
            }
        }
    }

IIRC I ended up using Reflections for finding plugins inside of jar files and some library (I'll think of it...) to do the ClassLoader part.  You basically create a classloader inside a singleton (Spring Service, w/e) which will you will load classes into.  There's a million ways to do this and my way isn't the best - it's just ""a way"".  In my example above this would be part of the PluginFactory.  Make a static (or singleton non-static) method which will ""Reload"" your plugins.  You can decide how you want to let your Plugins handle statefulness.  I made the choice that plugins get blown away and reloaded when they're reloaded and they can be reloaded at any time.  That was the rule.  Plugin authors then write their plugins in such a way that they know they can be reloaded at any time (basically, don't store things in memory if you want persistence). Ok, back to this reload method.  Have a spot on the filesystem you can scan for .jar files.  Pick em up and scan them for IPlugin classes (remember that marker interface?).  Instantiate those classes using reflection using the classloader that you decided to use (note: you can't actually refer to these classes by anything other than the interface you cast them to).  Now that you have the object, your factory plops them into a Map/List to be consumed by your consumer.  The way I did my plugins was a `List<ILoginPlugin>` which I then wrote a meta-plugin Class for every plugin interface to cycle through all plugins that were loaded (or return sane defaults if none were).

6. Extend this to everywhere in your application.  Find all the ""callback"" points you want to interject external custom business logic to.

7. Think about security.  The way I did it was to force plugins to be explicitly assigned via a system property.  You said ""I want this jar file located here to load this class which should be this plugin"".  You could also use code signing -- I didn't.  YMMV.  Also, depending on how the Classloader is set up you may have access to classes from the parent.  We did this - plugins were not made by randos, but by the company itself.  It also helps with having stuff like StringUtils there and not needing to load that up with the plugin.  It's dangerous though if you do have randos making plugins.

No need to mess with the classloader/classpath which really is a can of worms. I did this for a game, scripts are reloaded whenever they change on disk using a file listener. Keep state in the plug-in caller and not in the plug-in, it's much easier to reload plugins then. If you use a classloader think of isolation, unloading classes, caching / negative caching, plug-in reuse / pooling and synchronization issues. Also, if your plug-in jars contain resources, they might be cached differently - so if you unload all classes and replace the jar, the cache might still reference the old and now unavailable resources.

This was written a long time ago, but still works fine today. Basically very similar to the old Eclipse engine before they went heavy with OSGi. Concept is super simple.. plugins can define extension points that they implement.. and extensions that they extend from other plugin extension points. Engine dynamically loads plugins as .PAR files (basically zip files with all the classes and dependent libraries for the plugin wrapped up in side). It resolves plugins at runtime as they are loaded, and can be unloaded or reloaded (hot swap) with ease.

Very small library, but quite powerful. Originally built a Swing desktop framework that was all plugins. Never quite finished the framework as Swing started to go out of flavor, but it was quite nice for desktop apps back then.

oldprogrammer,"I'm not a fan of **var** but I can see its usefulness in some cases. 
 I'll likely use it sparingly.

I have to laugh at folks arguing about variable names like

      var i = someValue();

probably because I worked years ago in a BASIC where we had limited sized variable names (1 or 2 characters) and in Fortran where any variable that began with i, j, k, l, m and n were all by default integer values, any other letter was a real number.  Of course that was implied, you could always declare it differently.   That pattern stuck with many developers which is why those tend to be the iteration variables you see used in a for loop or some such.  

More verbose variable names are definitely much better but I don't want to rely on a name to deduce a type.  Nice thing is that I can write code like

      List<Employee> employees = getEmployees();

or

    var employees = getEmployees();

because neither is mandated.  I prefer the first approach but that's just me.  

One thing, though, is I believe I should not have to rely on an IDE to tell me about my code.  I should be able to get any information I need either by looking at the source directly or through proper documentation for source I don't have.

That's unfortunate. The fact that we're projecting both `id` columns should be sufficient for the ORM to prove that `DISTINCT` is not needed here in the SQL query (the deduplication will still happen in the client, of course).

The `HINT_PASS_DISTINCT_THROUGH` hint should not be necessary. I would expect the ORM to be smart enough to produce the right query.

So, in short, we have two unnecessary features for what the JPQL designers really had in mind: A `MULTISET()` operator:

First, they carefully describe the difference between the runtime of inserting at the beginning of an ArrayList vs a LinkedList, but completely forget about the performance of `get(index)`, instead just assuming that it's always constant time. What if the input list is a LinkedList?

Finally, the ""View"" solution is a valid solution, but it's cheating in the benchmark. The view is a lazy solution: you don't incur the runtime cost until you actually try to read from the list, so you need to take that into account in the benchmark.

RabidKotlinFanatic,"IMO, bad interview question with poor analysis.

1. ""Reversible"" is a bad interface even for a contrived interview question. Why isn't it generic? Why is it named ""Reversible"" when it's actually the thing performing reversals? The naming conventions make this look like student code. A method for reversing lists does not warrant its own interface to begin with (should be a static method).
2. In practice the best answer is almost always to use standard library methods and get on with your day. If you're using Guava you can use Lists.reverse to create a reversed view. You can also create a reversed copy of the list by using the ArrayList copy constructor and calling `Collections.reverse`. In Kotlin the call would simply be `list.reversed()`.
3. The benchmarking and ""performance"" focus of the article is amateurish. The question is not an optimization question, performance and throughput requirements are not provided and no indication is given of how the method is going to be called or how the reversed list is going to be used.

pron98,"The module system separates concerns. It is meant to provide the minimal amount of functionality and guarantees that would benefit most from being in the JVM, as well as to give the JVM the necessary amount of guarantees for its own benefit. Versioning can be handled by the build tool.

A reasonable question to ask at this point is, if the build system is responsible for configuration, what do we need the module system for? Well, for one, in addition to reliable configuration, the module system provides strong encapsulation. But even on the configuration front, the VM benefits from modules because it makes class loading faster, and versioning would not have helped here. So, the build tool handles versioning, and the module system only does whatever checks must be done in the VM, best be done in the VM, or are useful for the VM.

Would it be useful to add *more* checks to the module systems to enforce versioning? Perhaps, but only when we know the best way to do that, and only once the ecosystem has had time to digest the module system as it is.",1542745430.0

pron98,"1. To migrate to JDK 11 you do *not* need to modularize your app. A simple solution is to leave everything on the classpath. This is a good first step even if you do want to modularize your app later. You can still use jlink with `--add-modules`, adding the *JDK modules* you need, as discovered by jdeps.

2. Even when you modularize your app, there is no need to put *all* dependencies on the module path, including non-modular JARs as automatic modules. You can leave just the problematic JARs on the classpath (this way, all classes on the classpath become members of a single module, the *unnamed module*). As some of your modules would then depend on the unnamed module, you will likely need to add `--add-reads mymodule=ALL-UNNAMED`, which basically says that mymodule is allowed to use the classes on the classpath. This is a good second step for the transition period, while dependencies are gradually becoming modular. Then, if you want to use jlink, use it as `jlink --module-path [modulepath] --add-modules [module] ...`, adding the JDK modules required by the ill-behaved JARs, which you can discover with jdeps.

3. If you do want to move everything to the module path, getting around issues in libraries that have not yet adapted can be done with command line options. [This is a great list](https://blog.codefx.org/java/five-command-line-options-hack-java-module-system/) of options that can help you work around such issues.

Most companies will help you by assigning a senior person to mentor you, or your team will work to mentor you and help you grow as a developer. Not all companies are awesome though, so make sure to dig in and ask how you'll be helped to learn their software stack, and improve yourself as a developer.

---

Most likely no. You'll not have exposure to working in a team. You won't have exposure to testing. You won't know how to set up a production ready project. You won't know best, or even good practices for structuring projects.

You'll have had a lot of practice with javac, but most certainly not Maven or Gradle. 

I seriously doubt you'll get to learn a framework that is used in many companies. Spring Framework for instance, I learned while working at a non-java shop on my own time, by reading, and reading, and reading. Also in my own time I learned how the heck to produce an iOS app (back in the Objective-C days), and I didn't even own a Mac at the time to actually use Xcode to develop and compile my app.

Maybe you will have some practice using JDBC, but probably not in a way that will translate well to a company and production ready code.

The things you will be prepared for, is learning how to find the relevant information you need to continue learning with the guidance of a senior engineer at a company you join. It would be even better if you can do some internships before you graduate, so  you will get an idea of what real-world projects look like, how they operate, and how teams work together on them.

For now it will be important to look at some well maintained open source projects, try to contribute, and ask questions on project chat or just some kind of general forum.

You will also take away understanding how a statically typed language works and how to read and understand code, and understand the complexity of a specific piece of code. This by far is the most valuable thing you will have learned from college courses. Learning how to read and reason about code. Even reading something written in a language you don't know, you'll be able to recognize patterns that you learned from school, you'll notice loops, and control flow (if's, error handling, etc...).

Again, the logical reasoning that you learn from school is really going to be your biggest takeaway and the thing that will benefit you most in the long run.",1542551849.0
Temujin_123,"My second year in CS I realized that what I was being taught was what a programming language is, not what popular programming languages and frameworks are being used.

I used Java, C/C++, Lisp, SQL, and Python in school. A good foundation, but I also wanted to learn PHP which was more popular then than now. So one summer I checked out a PHP book from the library and worked my way through it. I gave myself a challenge project (e.g. make an e-commerce website - yeah ""e-commerce"" was somewhat novel back then). It became clear how what I had learned in the context of Java/C/C++ was applicable to PHP. I realized that what school was doing was making me fluent in learning programming languages.

That exercise gave me the confidence to go get an internship for the last couple years of school. That internship taught me full stack: front-end html/css, middle-tier PHP/Ruby, back-end MySQL, and ops with Unix/Linux administration - along with CVS (git didn't exist then). My mentor even challenged me to use Gentoo for my dev environment - I think he used that to really challenge me to learn Linux. When I was graduating this internship was a tremendous help to my getting three solid offers right out of school.

I've taken this approach of finding gaps in my skillset and taking the time to fill them by challenging myself to learn new languages or frameworks. This has lead to my skills now in BigData/NoSQL (Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Cassandra, MongoDB, etc) and cloud (Google & AWS) along with experience in machine learning - which has accelerated my career (now 14 years out from graduating).",1542553642.0

That being said, don't despair: check out the latest trends (for example: Stack Overflow and NetBeans yearly surveys) and that'll give you a pretty decent idea of what to study before going into interviews.

One of the good things about the IT industry is that usually there's more positions open than there are qualified professionals to fill them so as long as you can show that you're not a total conman and that you're solid on the basics and that you can learn at a decent pace, you're often good to go!

otakuman,"You're way ahead of me! I never learned Java in college (this was 20 yrs ago) - heck, not even PHP. I had to study on my own to even learn what all that was about.

Sadly, Java courses were expensive AF so I put that down for later. Then the situation changed and I had to learn JavaEE, Spring, Hibernate and Oracle PL/SQL. Had to get a  2K loan for those courses.

They paid off. Got the job, and in a year I had already paid the loan.

NOW, FOR THE NEXT LEVEL IN EMPLOYABILITY: Practical experience.

If you got the skills, what you need now is experience in the field. Find a business model, say, an e-shop, and start jotting down the requirements and mockups. A database of products, stores, prices, that the e-shop will display. Use three approaches: First, a server-rendered approach like JavaServer Faces (eew). Then, when you're finished, rewrite the project to Spring/MVC. And when you're done with THAT, rewrite it using JavaScript and REST services that you'll serve on the back. (Oh - don't forget to configure a JNDI datasource in your application server).

The headaches you'll have to deal with when writing with certain technologies, and finding out the solutions and workarounds (in other words, the know-hows) are what the industry values most. (In the case of JSF, my headache was the [application lifecycle](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jsf/jsf_life_cycle.htm) and how validation didn't get along well with AJAX requests. For REST, it was the CORS headers when the back end was in another port different from the front - this is not uncommon)

Write a document on the common problems and practical solutions, and keep that handy for the interview. You'll pass with flying colors.

So the lesson is: The vast majority of students will think they're prepared with what school gave them. If you go above and beyond that, you'll stand out above them. You'll be the 1% who studied on his own and prepared himself for the real world. Guess who will get the job.",1542630529.0

8igg7e5,"It should be noted that it is a feature preview in JDK12. The feature may change or even be removed, though I can't see the latter happening, in a future release.

Personally I think they need to be able to allow for specifying how the string is processed (compile time) rather than leaving it to String methods to post-process at runtime - since you might want to store the result as a static final but now you have the class constant string and your processed string.

Something like (functional suggestion only, syntax probably wants to be improved)

    String someString  = @RawString(tabSize=4, flags= {TRIM_LINES, TRIM_TRAILING, TRIM_LEADING_PREFIX, TABIFY, EOL_CRLF}) `
        This is a string
        where some lines might
            have trailing whitespace  
            and we want to ignore the code-indent
                but not the content indent.
        And I guess we should explicitly support Windows EOLs too.
    `;

Where the behaviour is something like:

* By default... (so some of the terms above could be elided)
   * EOLs are LF
   * Trailing whitespace is tirmmed, prefix whitespace is trimmed and whitespace-only/empty leading and trailing lines are trimmed.
   * Tabs in the source are interpreted as 8 spaces
* Flags are optionally then passed to alter this.
    * TRIM_LINES - Allowing leading and trailing lines of whitespace only to be removed (TRIM_LINES_ALL could also remove inner blank lines).
    * Allow per line whitespace to be trimmed
       * TRIM - all leading and trailing whitespace trimmed or TRIM_LEADING/TRIM_TRAILING for just one end of the line.
       * TRIM_LEADING_PREFIX - remove the number of spaces that are common to all non-whitespace-only lines (and remove that much from whitespace only lines if it exists)
    * TABIFY to convert remaining spaces.

To produce

    This is a string
    where some lines might
        have trailing whitespace  
        and we want to ignore the code-indent
            but not the content indent.
     And I guess we should explicitly support Windows EOLs too.

So with the defaults (and no tabs in the source)...

    String s = `This
        is
            a

        test
        `;

Becomes...

nutrecht,"There's no use case for JavaScript (or TS) on the back-end. Compared to the JVM I can't find a single benefit that the JVM can't also bring (async model is brought up often, but that's what we have) while the Java ecosystem has huge benefits over the generally immature (to put it kindly) NPM ecosystem. The tooling is better. The libraries are better. And the community is better.

So it's rather curious that us Java devs are described as 'cranky'. Maybe, just maybe, JavaScript devs should try and listen to us cranky old farts instead of making mistakes (like the left-pad mess) that were solved over a decade ago. 

I've used TypeScript extensively for Angular (I'm mainly a back-end dev but have quite a bit of FE experience, sometimes a Spring Boot service needs a front-end ;)) and compared to JavaScript (especially pre ES6) it's awesome. But it still has no use on the back-end. ",1542318868.0
TheRedmanCometh,"I really like typescript, but imo it has some...major problems I've had to work around. One major example for me is using refs in react, and calling methods from the ref.

As far as using it for general dev yeah sure it's good, but why the fuck would you use it for your backend? Just use Java. 

If you're gonna use typescript your development will BARELY be any faster than Java if it even is. The fact of the matter is there is still no IDE for js that's worth half a squirrel fart much less ts. Everyone seems to hate Eclipse, but even it's intellitype is infinitely superior to any kind of js plugin for sublime. IntelliJ I can only assume from most peoples' perspective has even better intellitype.

Database queries, however, must generally be very fast, or I end up tying a thread for long periods that could otherwise do useful work elsewhere.

(But at least memory use doesn't grow without bound, it's still those 8 threads that are busy and the server doesn't crash or OOM, so that's a plus.)

It would also help to be able to send multiple unrelated queries out at once and let the DB do them in parallel in whatever order it sees fit and pick the results afterwards. I have numerous situations where I must do something like 10 queries at once to assemble some complex response, and doing them sequentially is probably pretty slow compared to being able to start processing all of them in parallel, and receiving results as soon as DB can send them out.

So this stuff is pretty damn interesting to me.",1542214959.0

rzwitserloot,"What's the point?

When a computer has to switch threads, a few things happen, but most notably is the memory limitation: A bunch of different memory pages (and a stack!) have to now be used. The actual 'hop on over to this chunk of code and go run that for a bit' part is trivial, that's 1 jump, it's basically faster than jumping back to the top of a while loop. It's that memory context switch that really nails you; these days on a CPU switching pages takes 500+ cycles worth of time.

But here's the thing: async platforms _are no different_: Instead of hopping to a different page due to switching stack, you... hop to a different memory page because your async code ran out of bytes to process and is now going to jump along to the next active web connection in the async hopper, reading a the bytes that arrived in the packet or two of this particular TCP/IP conversation.

The major difference is primarily in memory management: Stacks are at least 1MB (on JVMs, at any rate) and you can't dynamically grow or shrink them. You can't even pick a stack size when creating threads. With async, you've got however much control you'd like: You make the ByteBuffer; you decide how large it has to be.

This is a real source of performance: If you have 8000 simultaneous web connections, you can absolutely do that with 8000 separate threads. People who like to write libs like OP here think 8000 threads are going to murder your server something awful but it really won't, modern CPUs have no problem with this. But it does imply _at least_ 8GB worth of stack, and then you also need heap and classes and the like. So you do need a server with plenty of RAM if you wanna do this.

With async you can have bytebuffers that are much smaller. Usually this means it actually runs slower but can run with less RAM. Mostly, performance suffers.

Which gets us back to OP: What's the point?

Studies done by the guy who runs mailinator show this: async means less memory needs but it's not really faster especially on linux and very modern windows, as they have excellent thread handling.

The odds you have a use case where async is any faster than sync is rare. The odds you have a use case where the async is not only faster, but definitely worth the serious headache it introduces when writing code.. very rare.

DannyB2,"The primary porpoise of package names is to avoid a collision with another developer's classes.

As long as your package name is something that other developers are extremely unlikely to use, then your own project is safe when you use third party libraries.

If you are building a library for the general public to use (eg, on github), then you would want to be more careful in your package name choice.

For personal code you might have:

`name.JohnDoe.*`

`name.johnDoe.util.*`

`name.johnDoe.api.*`

For a company name Killer Foobars Inc, you might have:

`killerFoobars.*`

`killerFoobars.util.*`

etc, or . . .

`mx.killerFoobars.*`

Maybe the ""com"" is unimportant.

&#x200B;

For a personal project, might might use your name, and, or, the project name.  What you are looking to avoid is a collision.  Merely using a reverse domain name is not a guarantee of that because anyone could construct any package name.

Code in an IDE seems a bit easier to work with using somewhat shorter package names.  So it's a balancing act between uniqueness and simplicity.  And maybe you don't own a domain name.

nutrecht,"> The monolith is appropriate only for a very small application, if at all. 

Sorry but calling BS. 

Microservice architectures have nothing to do with the size of the application. They are a solution for large *organisations*. If you're going to be spending 2 years building an application with a team of 4 developers sitting in a room together, I would still strongly urge you to go for a monolith.

Microservice architectures work for large organisations with multiple teams working on the same 'application'. You can't scale a team larger than what you can feed with 2 pizza's, so you need to break the org up into separate teams. There it makes sense to have each team be responsible for a few applications and have those applications talk to each other via some agreed upon method. 

Back in the days these were enterprise integration patterns via a stateful service bus, and that was a shit approach. Now they communicate directly via HTTP (and we call it microservices instead of SOA) and it's slightly less shit. 

It's still complicated as heck and easy to fall into the trap of building a distributed monolith if your team is not up to par (and frankly; most teams aren't), but at least that's better than building an undeployable monolith. 

Your conclusion that ""It’s safe to say that the days of a monolithic architecture are fading."" is tripe. It's nonsense you see from people who don't understand what problems microservices do and do not solve. ",1542120103.0

gizmogwai,"If it’s an existing large codebase with few tests, you better start with high level tests, at the UI level.
This has several benefits :

-	you gain familiarity with the application by using it
-	it helps you focus on sunny scenarios first 
-	you quickly cover a good portion of used code

Once this is done (you don’t have to write too many of them), you can start to go at a lower layer, typically integration tests. This way you can gain knowledge of the underlying relation between the code and the storage engine, or other external applications. 

Unit tests come at the end. On a large untested codebase, they won’t provide you any quick win. Although any **new** code, in that application should start with them. 

If you’re lucky it’s a Spring based application, and you’ll find plenty of utility classes in the framework itself to help you in your task, as well as a lot of tutorials on the net.

aram535,"My recommendation is:

1. Understand the difference between tests and IntegTests.  You don't want to test other systems.
2. Make sure you're not pointing to your production instance for ANYTHING.  Not even a comparator!
3. If you're not 100% sure what the method does, isolate methods to test in a test project and walk through it.  Think of things that could break it.  Are they checking maximum length? what if it's an empty array?  If using generic, does it account for a different object, etc.
4. Understand the inputs and outputs of the method
5. Write a working unit test, don't repeat yourself.  There is no point in testing ""ABC"" then ""CBA"".  Test scenarios, not inputs/outputs.  Don't forget about testing for nulls, too many, not enough.  Each field and variable should be tested separately (that doesn't mean a test method for each).
6. Write unit tests that chuck exceptions, and except them.

  Java EE 8 and Angular ( If you are not interested in angular, you can just ignore that part because this book is written in two parts the first half is all about Java EE and   
 the second half is blending angular to JavaEE. So, it is easy for readers to skip the angular part if they are not interested)

  Java EE 8 Cookbook (This book has very cool recipes that helps improve your understanding on Java EE, after you finish reading the above two books)

  Architecting modern Java EE Applications (After completing above said books, this books helps in making design decisions. The book title says it all)

That even happened in Apache commons-lang.

Then you can have bugs introduced, e.g. Java 1.4 added a sanity check in the date parsing logic of java.util.Calendar that assumed daylight savings time could be at most 1 hour - which is true in *most* timezones but not everywhere always.

Java 1.4 also overhauled the focus subsystem in AWT/Swing, which caused some code in my company (which may or may not have depended on unspecified behaviour) to get into an endless loop.

i_post_things,"I guess it depends on how many applications and servers need upgrading, what technology stack you run on, and what sort of risk tolerance you have.

If you are in a fortune 500 company, 

- Do you have thousands of applications that need regression testing across dozens of departments?
- Do you have an automated regression suite to run against each environment?  Is there any level of manual testing?  Do you need to run some sort of 24 or 28 hour load test for each application?
- Do you have dozens of operations teams across different departments
- Are you running on a mashup of various Linux flavors (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS) or various versions of each?
- How automated your platform is:
  - Are you using AWS, Google Compute Cloud?
  - Are you automating your own infrastructure through Docker, Ansible, Chef, etc?
  - Are you manually configuring your VMs almost 'by hand'?
- How risk-tolerant are you?  Do you run medical software?  Billing software?  Stock exchange software?

I wouldn't be surprised if there were a lot of companies that size still running 5-year old versions of RHEL with java 1.6 on VMs built with custom settings from 10 years ago that people are simply afraid to touch because there isn't a point of contact for whatever software is running on it.",1541704323.0

Contracts can be implemented with assertions like Guava preconditions (which could also be used as postconditions) or Kotlins `require` functions. However, there is no simple syntax to check invariants. But technically there could be a method that checks the state which could be called on every mutation (which should only happen through method calls). But having to explicitly call such a method is a source of errors, since it is easy to forget.

A simple solution to check invariants could be an annotated method to check invariants which is called via reflection.

```java
@Invariant
public void invariant() {
  requireNotNull(a);
  require(y > 1);
  require(y < x);
}
```

This method would be called after each public method (like in Microsoft's Code Contracts) and this could be performed with an AOP framework like AspectJ or Spring's AOP.

First thing's first, read through Guice best practices

(start here [https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/MinimizeMutability](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/MinimizeMutability) )

Next, get familiar with javax.inject's various classes (It's a small api, shouldn't take too much time.)

[https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/package-summary.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/package-summary.html)

Finally, get familiar with AutoFactory

[https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/factory](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/factory)

Do you hate that errors are runtime only?

[https://google.github.io/dagger/](https://google.github.io/dagger/)

Viola.  You've got the grounding for a ""not hard to maintain"" dependency injection system.

I find that ""DI is hard/confusing/too magic""  Almost always stems from either a lack of understanding or violations of Guice's best practices.  And the ""runtime issues"" are pretty much completely resolved by using Dagger.",1541595352.0

        if (something(o))
          break woot;
    
      throw new E();
    }

and

    if (something && noneMatchSomething(list))
      throw new E();
     
    // And then:
    private boolean noneMatchSomething(List<?> list) {
      for (Object o : list)
        if (something(o))
          return false;
      return true;
    }

There are four aspects of why I favor the `return`\-based code:

# 1) Separation of Concerns

The `break`\-based code makes it really hard to immediately see the **big picture**, which is: **throw-conditionally**. When you try to find out this big picture (i.e. **what** the code does), you're *forced* to plow through the details too (i.e. **when** the code does it).

On the other hand, the `return`\-based code is *beautifully* separated: there's the condition + the conditional action.

And only if you need to know **when** the code does stuff, you read the inside of the `if` clause (and potentially navigate to the method that is called - but only if the method name is not self-explanatory enough).

# 2) Unambiguity

The `break`\-based code is problematic because such a construct (a label, two `if`s, one `for`, a `break`) can potentially do many different things, depending on the order, number of `if`s, etc.

It's like the difference between `for (i = 0, size=items.size(); i < size; i++)` and `for(T item: items)`. The former can do many things (e.g. `i = 1` or `i < size - 1`), and it takes more time to make sure that it does the ""default"" thing.

# 3) Flexibility

If you needed to add a third condition (executed at the end) in the `break`\-based code, it'd definitely be non-trivial. But with the `return`\-based code, it's easy and still very readable:

    if (something && noneMatchSomething(list) && anotherCondition)
      throw new E();

# 4) Familiarity

Last but not least, /u/lukaseder is right that people are rather unaware of (or at least unfamiliar with) the break-out-of-if construct. So using this construct incurs a cost of *unfamiliarity* for others (e.g. for the developers that Lukas will be employing as jOOQ inevitably grows :) ).

If this construct provided a *clear* gain, I'd be for using it in order to promote it. But as it is, I believe the cost is greater than the gain.

&#x200B;

Finally, as to the problematic cluttering of the code by the extracted private method, I sometimes (but only if the class is large enough):

* extract a package-private helper class (e.g. `SomeObjects`)
* move the `noneMatchSomething` method there
* change its signature to `static boolean noneMatchSomething(SomeObject someObject, List<?> list)`
* call it as `SomeObjects.noneMatchSomething(this, list)`

The main drawbacks are that: 1) it's quite verbose, 2) it requires making the `SomeObject.something` method package-private.",1541927779.0

Sipkab,"I don't see my favorite one: Immutable state

You are storing any modifiable state data in an encapsulated field, and each thread retrieves its working copy before doing any work. The state objects are immutable. This can be very well paired with atomic access.

    public class MyState{
        public final int i1;
        public final int i2;
        public MyState(...) { ... } 
    }
    
    //this.state
    private volatile MyState state;
    
    @Override
    public void run(){
        //the code for concurrent threads
        MyState s = this.state;
        //do something
        this.state = new MyState(...);
    }

This way the multiple state data is always consistent.

However! When you want to derive some data and update the state based on that, you might want to use CAS access to modify the current state at the end of the work. And if the state was concurrently modified by another thread, consider doing the work again. There are tradeoffs for this as if the work is very long to run, then you should just use some synchronization methods, not to do unnecessary work.

    //assume that state is stored in an AtomicReference.
    //or used with AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater
        state.updateAndGet(s -> {
            //do work on s, possibly not too long

nutrecht,"> We can duplicate mutable state into a local variable and reference it locally to take advantage that locally scoped data is inherently thread-safe.

Actually you should pretty much never ever even share variables between threads. It doesn't matter if you synchronize them or mark them as volatile; it's pretty much always a recipe for disaster. 

For example:

> If we have a map of key-value pairs, we will probably expose the map to the world and let our threads have at it.

No, you really really don't. Even a concurrent map can still cause deadlocks and race conditions. Concurrency bugs are incredibly hard to deal with because they are the ultimate heisenbugs; they often disappear when observed through a debugger or via (synchronising) System.out statements.

Like many DZone articles this one is shallow at best. The author itself barely has experience with concurrent programming (which I suspected with the mention of JMonkeyEngine).

By far the easiest way to deal with concurrency is by using the actor model: threads work completely independently from each other and communicate via messages. This means you'll probably use an ExecutorService you push 'work' into and the threads do the 'work' and then write it wherever it needs to be written. Whenever you dealing with shared variables or maps or worse manual locking, you are more often than not doing it wrong. Code like this is a maintenance nightmare. ",1541413781.0

""Wrap everything in synchronized!""

The comments on these articles are always harping on about how impossible hard concurrency/multi-threading is. Of course it is no surprise that everyone finds it impossibly hard when there are millions of garbage articles on thread safety ""tricks"" and barely any on important foundational knowledge like the JMM.

Anyone who is interested in effective concurrent programming should look past ritualistic advice and focus on understanding WHY problems occur (e.g. deadlocks aren't an inevitable result of using locks), familiarize themselves with the concurrency primitives and guarantees of their language+platform (the JMM), try to read and understand different theoretical approaches to concurrency as well as the techniques used to design concurrent data structures (including lock-free and wait-free structures).",1541530855.0

pron98,"Modules provide two advantages: strong encapsulation and reliable configuration.

* Strong encapsulation ensures that no other module (unless its a ""friend"" module that you explicitly allow) can access your internal packages, even with reflection, and that you don't accidentally use other modules' internal classes. This ensures that all components are accessed only through their designated public APIs.

* Reliable configuration helps you escape from ""classpath hell."" The classpath is sensitive to the order in which JARs are listed, and can cause mysterious problems in the event of the same package appearing in more than one JAR (AKA split packages), in which case classes can be loaded from somewhere you do not expect. This makes your deployment configuration brittle. Modules help ensure that every package exists in only a single module that your application uses, and the module system ensures that the configuration is correct immediately when you launch the VM (i.e., verifies that all your required modules are found and that there are no split packages or cyclical dependencies), rather than failing at runtime with NoClassDefFound and other mysterious errors. 

Both these benefits help you build a robust and well-engineered application. Code that will benefit most from modules is large applications/libraries and/or with many dependencies, or libraries with many of clients. Basically, modules help enforce good engineering practices in the large. ",1541180655.0

You are applying for a programming internship as a student, I'd assume part time to work alongside your studies. If the hiring managers are sane, they aren't going to expect you to be too familiar with stuff - that's what the internship is for, learning as you go. Unless you are aiming for internships at the tech giants, most small to mid sized companies shouldn't expect you to know much.

amackenz2048,"To be honest not much is expected of interns in terms of knowledge or experience.  I was a sophomore when I got my first internship.  I barely knew what a database was at the time...

If you can show that you're willing and eager to learn, have a positive attitude, can work independently, and have a strong work ethic (no disappearing at noon, etc.) then you'll be fine.  They're investing time in you by bringing you on board - so taking the job seriously and being eager to be involved will go a long way.

You may not even be doing code as you think of it at first (my internship started me out doing QA)  but don't despair - it can be difficult to bring even an experienced software developer up-to-speed on a project.  Most young programmers don't realize that ""knowing how to code"" is about half of the job.  The rest of it is working with others, understanding business requirements and translating them to code, troubleshooting problems, etc.  And those are the things an internship would teach you.

The best way to find out is to try.  Go apply for things!  Let them decide if you're qualified.  Good luck!",1541169839.0
mgreen0827,"I went to school for a CIS degree (college of business). I joined AITP (Association of Information Technology Professionals). I think having completed Java I & II, Database I & II, Systems Design I & II was all they were really looking for. That being said, I didn't actually do any sort of specific programming test during the interview. I took a CPAB (Computer Programmer Aptitude Battery). Basically, it was a test that tested in several areas like quick math, vocabulary, and flow charting. They didn't give you enough time for any section (hence, *battery*), but I still think I did well. After a few interviews, I was offered an intern position.

I'm still at that same company today (4 years later) as a Senior Software Engineer. Entry level programmers at my company aren't actually required to have a degree but it helps. They want you to be able to show your experience. Every company is different though.

Just practice your skill set. Expand on Java (I recommend Java + Spring Framework + Gradle  + PostgresQL + JUnit testing/Spock Testing). Join IT clubs if you can. Make friends and network in your courses and ask if they've had any luck with internships. Start a github account and upload some sample projects there. Create a good resume and practice your people/interview skills.

I never had a great GPA and I really didn't know how to program until I started the internship and struggled for months. Just keep at it and don't give up. You'll get your foot in the door eventually.

Finally, and this advice goes beyond java programming, go into an interview with confidence.  Know that the qualifications for an intern are not that you are an expert in all things, but have a thirst for knowledge and the confidence that you can pick things up quickly.

4ernik,"I actually working in a finance company and we have pretty much reporting. Overall about 200 reports per day on multiple SQL Server instances and I can say - don't use Java for BO reporting.
Java is a great solid language,  I actually Java developer, but still - don't do that. 
My suggestion is some kind of script language. If you want my opinion - Python is a great choice. 
Let me try to elaborate and provide some insights. 
1. Report usually requires not so many actions: pull the data, join it(usually on DB level, I have reports with 20+ join in one query to get plain data sets ready to process), reduce it and save result. You'll spend long time in Java doing not the report, but ritual around it. Create project, inject libs in pom, create DTO, dance around with setup of POI, spring, scheduler, write the result either injecting apache commons or by dealing with 5 layers of buffered writers. As a result for 10 rows building report you`ll write 500 handling Java. 
In Python you can start with report right away and write very little ""infrastructure"" code. Packages like csv coming built in and requires 1 row to start writing the file. Database connections handled in ""base"" script which is injected to all other ones. Just place it in root folder, put DB, mail, SMS, FS functionality here and reuse without rebuilding of all dependent projects when you decide to change one row.
2. Changing the report. With Python just go ahead, change the file, test it and that's it. It's not applicable to big companies with strict rules about touching productions, but for mid size businesses it gives you tons flexibility. With Java you'll need to at least rebuilt and move new jar. If you'll have ""base"" jar with common stuff just imagine rebuilding all the reports after each change in it. 
3. ""Do it other way this time"". You will get request to run one off reports time to time and with Python just copy script to another folder, change it, run it, forget about it. No changes to models, no builds, no dancing around row mappers or JPA. 
4. You'll never see 15Mb report which doing 1 query and write csv, but have spring and tons of apache libs inside. 5Kb scripts is your choice. 
5. Use native windows scheduling. You will be able to run it as correct win user which is important for security, and changing schedule Wil be waaay easier. Just compose daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly cmd files and list scripts to run inside. After that just run cmd from win scheduler. 
Easy to add new script to schedule, easy to find schedule for script, because schedule is outside the script and not compiled. Easy to provide report on reports you're running(you'll need it as well, trust me)

rzwitserloot,"[1] JREs: These are gone. 8 is supported for now but will disappear too. You're still releasing desktop apps built on java to customers?

So, the JRE? Still exists, but now you build it and you ship it.

[2] Which version of the JDK do you want? There's only one source distribution and it's called OpenJDK. But source doesn't run, someone needs to compile it, someone needs to make an installer, someone needs to have a site you can go to, to download this stuff, and most importantly someone needs to stay on the ball, apply security patches, and have mechanisms in place for you to know about them. There are MANY parties who are doing this job (the job of building the openjdk sources and making binaries for you to download and use, and for them to perhaps support), pick a party. I'll boil it down to 4 options (but there are more out there):

[2a] Oracle's OpenJDK. These have no long-term support _AT ALL_, not even the so-called 'LTS' versions. This means you have to move to the new version the day it comes out. So, now, you're on Java11, and come march or whatever it is, you have to switch to 12, because the day oracle offers the OpenJDK12, is the day they stop supporting OpenJDK11.

[2b] Oracle's OracleJDK. _THIS_ is where that 'long term support' stuff comes up: This is oracle's commercial build. It costs money, but it entitles you to support. Also, the LTS versions of OracleJDK _will_ be supported for years.

[2c] Azul. This is like 2b, a for-pay entity offering support.

[2d] AdoptOpenJDK. An open source community attempt to ship binaries. They aim to support LTS releases (such as 11 and 8) for a long time. Free, legal.


I'd go with adoptopenjdk.

pron98,"> This makes them ""major"" releases, not because they have a bigger feature set but because they multi year support.

No, that makes them long-term support. Even if you believe it deserves the adjective ""major"", regardless of whether others think the same, this introduces confusion as the name ""major"" has a very specific meaning in the Java release model, and the end to major releases is a big change in the new model. Using this term is unnecessary and does nothing more than confuse readers.

> Oracle's claim is that because each release is only 6 months after the previous one, there won't be as much ""stuff"" in it, thus it won't be as hard to upgrade. While true, it is also irrelevant. What matters is whether the upgrade has the potential to damage your code stack or not. And clearly, **going from 11 -> 12 -> 13 has much greater potential for damage than 8 -> 8u20 -> 8u40 ever did.**

What breaks code isn't *releases* but *individual changes*. While it's true that a spec change has a greater potential to break your code than an implementation change, if every change broke every codebase out there we wouldn't have the robust platform that we do. Rather, *some* changes break *some* code. If, say, every 1 in 100 changes breaks your particular code, then you would expect every major release (containing, say, 150 changes) to break your code, but only one in every, say, 6 feature releases. 

So even if we assume (the untrue assumption) that a semi-annual update release under the old model had zero chance to break your code, while it is true that now every six months there is the *potential* of breakage, actual breakage would occur at the same rate it used to before (assuming you upgraded major versions). Similarly, the *effort* of upgrade is also a function of the changes, not of the versions. If the total effort of upgrade to the changes in a major version under the old model (say, every 3 years), was 2 person-months, then the same amount of effort would be required under the new model, only spread out. Is that better or worse? I think it's better, but only time will tell.

> Build tools and IDEs: Will your IDE support each new version on the day of release? Will Maven? Gradle?

The expectation is that your code will run on the new release without special support from build tools (unless you use some relevant new features). The rate of changes that affect builds in a way that requires immediate support from tooling is not expected to change. 

For example, Gradle still has rather poor support for modules, but you don't need modules to run on new releases. [It also crashes](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/7059) when handling some JDK 11-targeted class files in its ~~Javadoc~~ Test task, but it does work well on 10-targeted classes.

> One possible middle ground is to develop your application for Java 12, but run it in production on Java 13, 14, 15 etc. as soon as they come out. Sadly, this approach is less viable than it should be. The removal of APIs and changes to the bytecode version add uncertainty to the stack. Even if your code doesn't use one of the removed APIs, one of your libraries might.

Such changes, however will affect you whether you stay on LTS versions or jump on the train. It's only a question of whether you prefer to deal with them all at once or gradually.

> If you adopt Java 12 and use a new language feature or new API, then you are effectively locking your project in to the release train. 

That is true. Perhaps the best course of action to the wary and undecided and is to adopt a wait-and-see approach: try the release train for a couple of versions *without* adopting new features. If you see you find upgrades hard, you can drop back to LTS. If not, you can consider adopting new features. The key is that there is *no need to make this decision right now based on speculation*. 

Any speculation about the actual effects of the new model (including my own above) is just that -- speculation. Time will tell whether the new model helps (as I think) or is a genuine stumbling block (as /u/jodastephen thinks). In any event, while all change is scary -- and while this one does require attention -- there is absolutely no need to panic. A responsible developer has all the tools to cope with the change in a cautious way and give it a chance. 

BOTTOM LINE: Maybe jumping on the ""release train"" is right for you or maybe sticking to LTS is, but making a big commitment to either right now, based on speculation, is neither wise nor necessary.

RupertMaddenAbbott,"I learnt Python before Java.

I found the ecosystem around Python to be a lot more complicated. With Java you just need the JDK and an IDE (recommend IntelliJ community edition which is free) and you have enough to start. Later you will need a build tool (recommend Maven) and that's it. With Python you have a lot more options and power but that also means a lot more combinations. I found I was spending a lot of time getting things working together whilst reading many blogs from people with slightly different setups that weren't quite applicable. I didn't want that much choice whilst I was just getting started.

I'm not sure if this is still an issue but the Python 2/3 split was also an unnecessary complication for a beginner that Java doesn't have.

Lastly Java is a lot more verbose and explicit. I regularly found myself getting lost in Python. Where did this field come from? Where did this function get imported from? Nothing difficult for somebody who knows there way around Python but really tricky to keep track of whilst you are learning. In Java, there is also a much lower reliance on reflection as developers like to rely on the compiler to catch errors.

I think starting with Python is really just shooting yourself in the foot because of how weird its syntax and dependency management is. Like others have already said, it's really only good for small stuff, not full-blown programs. Learn it later as a utility.

Java is by far the best middle ground between beginner-friendliness and a ""real-world"" programming language. Every time someone asks me about learning how to program, I tell them to start with Java. You get the advantage of learning basic C-style syntax and program structure early on as well as the ability to quickly transition to object-oriented concepts in one language.

That being said, almost any language is great to start with. I even started with JavaScript. Just get comfortable with something and stick with it for a while.

Both can be used for things like AWS Lambda, web applications, etc. If you're in this category, then it is really a matter of preference. 

Java typically has much richer tooling, with a learning curve to match. Python has dynamic typing, which is great for quick prototyping, but leads to more bugs as well.

The problem with Python is that although the ecosystem is broad and comprehensive, its not at all cohesive. So learning to use libraries can be difficult  in that each one is a DSL for doing whatever. Java's ecosystem is broad, comprehensive and cohesive meaning that once you learn a few libraries, they all are pretty much the same so you can jump into new domain areas relatively quickly without having to learn the colloquialisms of the library (like you would with Python).

> All @…​Test annotations are meta-annotated with @ExtendedWith(SpringExtension.class) so this redundant part of the setup can be removed if you’re using JUnit 5. Spring Boot also uses a maven-surefire-plugin version that does not require any custom setup to use JUnit 5.

I assume that is causing the issue.  So I added a dependency to fix it:

    testCompile(""org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.2.0"")
    testRuntime(""org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.2.0"")
    
Now I get a strange error about Gradle unable to read a classfile.    

    Execution failed for task ':test'.
     failed to read class file C:\prj\seerapi\build\classes\java\test\com\imsweb\seerapi\lab\executor\ApiExecutor$Builder.class

Unfortunately the way you handle this, by having me spread your TimeService everywhere in production code, is not a way I want to deal with this. Sorry. ",1540902709.0
Slanec,"It's unfortunate that the library expects us to rewrite our applications to use the `TimeService` everywhere. The [`java.time.Clock`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Clock.html) abstraction is (should be!) already enough for this, it's a resource we're injecting into our classes where needed.

The [`MutableClock`](https://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/MutableClock.html) from [ThreeTen-extra](https://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/) already provides a way to have a settable clock in tests.

What would be useful is an implementation of `ScheduledExecutorService` taking a `Clock`, because `ScheduledExecutorService` is currently exactly the abstraction layer we're depending on, are injecting into our classes, and are mocking to have settable time in out tests. See e.g. [this Mockito article](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/Using-Spies-%28and-Fakes%29#case-study-2-to-test-a-jobscheduler-that-uses-scheduledexecutorservice) on how to do that nicely.

It's not hard, but yes, there should be a library providing these things. If you're really thinking about getting adopted, please consider this way.",1540918561.0
cruftex,"> I would like to show you my new idea of time managing in java applications in order to improve testability.

Needing a movable time source may also be an indicator that your code is not well structured, or, that the taken approach for testing is not suitable to catch all the variants that might exist. I saw projects not having unit tests, but depending on testing based on automated clicking through the (web) application. So, if you are only able to test a complete running applications, you need a movable time source, if your application is behaving differently based on the current time. You might not need that if you take another test approach and improve the structure of your application.

I consider calling the clock in normal application code (aka ""business logic"") a general anti pattern. If the outcome of a program is varying depending on time, then the actual time value needs to be a parameter, not the clock to read the time from. In our business code, time lookups are generally disallowed. Every method that depends on the current time gets a parameter, e.g. `Date now`. Code that depends on time becomes testable, and it is obvious, by looking at the parameters, that the code outcome depends on the time.

On the project page you say:

> In a few applications I was struggling with time aspect during tests.

It would be interesting to know what kind of use cases make you ""struggle"" and discuss about the possible alternative approaches to solve the problem. Can you give examples what problems you are trying to solve?

BlackDrackula,"How bad is ""bad"" - 10 seconds per test? a minute? more?

Once your dev is done, performance isn't really a concern when the tests are running as part of a regular (e.g. nightly) build.  The issue would be if it's adding significant time to your development.

In the past projects I've worked on we've done things like have the test class create the DB locally and populate it with static data like config, preferences, some common test data etc; then each test just blows away any transactional data before starting.  This was a decent compromise so that the entire schema didn't need to be recreated for each test.",1540858264.0
7F1AE6D2,"Unless you have a multi-threaded test case or you have to insert a huge amount of data into the DB for each test, you can just roll back the transaction at the end of the test method. This is the default for Spring's test support.

Spring would also keep the context with all components alive across tests und thus only construct them once as long as the packages/classes to component-scan don't change.

This means you should scan all your project's packages in an abstract test class and use it for all spring tests. Deviating from this can be a source of bugs: if you have any static references to Spring components and you have a test with a different context, the static references will still point to the old instances.

If you use JPA/Hibernate, all entities you need as part of your setup should be created in the same transaction as the test method. This is the default with Spring if you do your setup in an @org.junit.Before method.

This way you can modify and verify the instances created in the setup as no other instances of these entities will be created by JPA and any detached entities your application code saves will be merged into these, i.e. they always reflect the persistent state.",1540892579.0
fdside,"If you're talking about isolated integration tests(you launch you service with all dependencies and then there is some suite that runs, let's say REST calls, to verify correct working), then it's up to test cases. It mean's that they interact with system same way as user would, so no any kind of DB resets for sure :). So test would be like: 1) create users (returns id), 2) using that id -> get user details etc. So basically test doesn't care about DB state, because it creates own.   
On the other hand, if we are talking about internal testing, then you can do whatever you want. In some cases you might want to just mock entire DB (when testing business logic). In other cases, when you want to test some query, for example, then the only thing you need is DB and some kind of service, and everything else is not initialized at all, or just mocked. In that case, there is no need to cleanup DB tests, it's just that a test itself is transactional.   
External services, better be mocked all the time in integration tests, since you don't want you tests to fail 50% of time, because of some non-determinism. Leave it for stage env, where you can test it manually, or implement some kind of schema validation/basic url and credentials (ping) testing.",1541162834.0

2\. Before Java 8 it was straightforward to read, unless you really went out of your way to write obscure code.  
3\. Most the valid complaints about the language are still minor to work around. getter/setter stuff is annoying but it's just straightforward extra time it's not stressful.  
4\. No language is really offering significant improvements. They offer hype, then 2 years later they fall out of favor and another new language offers more hype, etc. Java stays pretty much the same which is nice.  
5\. Compared to C/C++ java is way better at letting me focus on solving the problem rather than solving computer issues. Garbage collection and no manual memory management is fantastic. I really prefer static typing over dynamic typing because no one documents anything except static typing forces you to document all the types.

Javascript might be complete huge mess compared to Java but at least it isn't as verbose or outdated, I mean seriously, I got surprised that how the fuck it is almost 2019 and there is no sign of String interpolation which is a very common feature that got already made in most of languages, and more and more(like getters and setters, they are basically just normal methods that you will have to make yourself, there is no syntatic sugar no anything unlike C# and there are surely more and more like Linq that honestly feels like cheating when you use it)

I know that Javascript is not fully OOP but C# is and it makes everything Java does much better. I only think of learning it because it is cross-platform(.NET Core is cross-platform too but it might take little more time for WPF to be that too) and because of the ecosystem(C#'s is smaller than Java's but after thinking, it might not matter because you will use like 20% or 10% of the whole ecosystem anyway) Let's be honest, Java is just popular because of historical reasons when it's obvious that languages like Groovy, Kotlin, C# are way much better.

Option ""Persuade the manager"".  Let's talk about a $500 (yearly billing first year) cost.  You work about 2000 hours per year.  Having IntelliJ means that you've got a $0.25/hour cost in the first year for IntellIJ.  Will you be $0.25 more productive each hour with IntelliJ over Eclipse?  That's fairly certain.  $500 is a rounding error when it  comes to compensation in most places.  Note that it will be cheaper next year and the year after that.

BlueGoliath,"I strongly disagree with the introduction and use of var, and your presentation hasn't changed that. Like many others before, you claim that Var increases readability but when your switching back and forth just to save keystrokes you inadvertently hurt the very thing your trying to improve: readability. Inconsistent programming hurts readability and understanding of code. It's the same with advanced for loops, streams, lambdas, anonymous classes, etc. A consistent programming style is a major factor into readability. 

You might argue that as long as it's being applied to your style guidelines, readability isn't being impacted because it's being used as it should be within the guidelines. That isn't the problem. The problem is that preexisting ways of doing writing code with var exist and they are consistent because they can be used in very situation. You're trying to reinvent a less round wheel with var.

@18:27 you claim that:

    var x = getSomething()

is meaningless because both the variable and method names are meaningless(AKA they aren't specific enough). I strongly disagree with this. Why? Because there are perfectly good reasons why you would want a generic return method like this, namely when a class that implements an interface with a type(say Integer) but which might change on the type specified by the class depending on what the class is trying to *conform to*.

Note: JavaFX does this with the Spinner contro, where you specify the type and get the current value from the provided items of that type via the diamond operator and can get the current value via getCurrentValue().

Example from [GoliathENVIOUS](https://github.com/BlueGoliath/GoliathENVIOUS), which I wrote:

>NvSettings.getPrimaryGPU().getCoreClock().getCurrentValue() // returns the current value of this NvAttribute. Could be an Integer, FanMode, PerformanceLevel, or something else depending on the implementation

otherwise how else would you conform different implementations into a coherent API? Remove getCurrentValue() and have separate interfaces which contain each specific method call for every type used and extend a base interface? Sure I guess that may work depending on the scenario but it can quickly become messy.

To add on using my API linked above, if I were to do:

>var controller  = NvSettings.getPrimaryGPU().getCoreOffset().getController().get();

with var, where getController().get() returns an interface implementation of NvControllabe<T>:

With only reading the documentation once and without documenting it with a comment, how can you know what generic type T is?  If I was to write the same code without var:

>NvControllable<Integer> controller = NvSettings.getPrimaryGPU().getCoreOffset().getController().get();

I now know every time I use the variable controller what T is, because it's explicitly declared on the left hand side. I no longer need to read the documentation to figure out what T is. It's *far* more readable.",1540726602.0

Actually I think variables should be `final` by default and possible reassignment should be made explicit (I avoid the term ""Immutablity"" here, since the final objects themselves are not necessarily immutable). Since this isn't the case in java (and will never be), I explicitly specify `final` on all fields, local variables and method parameters unless I explicitly need them non-final.

However I never make classes or methods final. A lot of people think that immutable classes should be made final, but I see it differently. A class derived from a mutable class is not necessarily mutable. It is possible to make it mutable, but that is the responsibility of the person doing the inheritance. However prohibiting such inheritance restricts the user of such classes too much in my opinion.",1540539748.0
nutrecht,"It depends on the project. I've been in projects where every member, argument and variable was to be marked final when possible. I am now in a project where people don't really care about it.

I personally don't care that much either way as long as people agree on a common style and it gets checked with a tool like checkstyle. 

Personally I'm in favour of using final on arguments and using immutable DTO's as much as possible. I'm against making classes final by default (it doesn't add much and causes issues with Spring and Mockito for example) and I feel making local variables final is just too much clutter.

I'm also a huge Kotlin fan so whenever possible I'd use that where you have sensible defaults with no visual clutter. But I can imagine that it's not for everyone. 

The main problem with rules like these is that by the time you got a team to accept this kind of stuff they're generally mature enough to not really need them. If you have good developers that write short simple methods with a single responsibility you don't really need final arguments. If you have developers that don't do this, adding some final modifiers to arguments isn't going to save you. There's no quick fix for stupid. ",1540538201.0

rzwitserloot,"This sounds like 'magic thinking': That by merely following extremely simple, easily lint-able rules, that this small step will somehow lead to a team that writes code that doesn't suck.

It never works. Coding is hard. It just is. You can't dumb it down like this.

The problem is, if your coding team doesn't know the basic concepts required to understand why some class should be final (or not), then they are going to write code of a quality that is well below the level where it makes sense to worry about things like this.

The theory would be that, hey, even if they have no idea why, as long as they follow the rule of 'all params must be final', the code will be better. But, no, that does not happen. They'll work around these (to them) annoyances.


So let's presume smart coders instead. Maybe you can use code review to get there. Should you mark classes and parameters final?

I say: No.

Primary reason: it clutters up your code. If you really want to consider modifying a parameter as problematic, then configure your IDE to emit a warning when you change it. This avoids the clutter, and it even lets you change it just for debugging purposes (you should definitely say that all warnings are to be considered showstopper for checking into a shared branch, let alone production code. But warnings do let you run the debugger and do a test run with some temporary code in place. Better yet, the warning highlights that there's temporary code in place, it's perfect).

Secondary reason: You SHOULD change parameters. At least, right at top.

Let's say a method takes a String parameter that represents a gender. The method decodes this gender. F and V mean female, M means male, and anything else means 'unknown'. Let's further say that you should trim the input and it's case insensitive.

The easiest way to do this, is to make the trim and uppercasing modifications right up top. If you make a local var to keep the mutated input, it's real easy to accidentally use the original parameter, and unless some input actually has some spacing, you won't know. Yes, tests should catch that, but it's still an easy mistake to make. Clearly, just modifying the original is FAR clearer: You now have fewer variables in scope (which clearly is superior to having more variables in scope, obviously).

the argument against final classes goes in a similar fashion: It's extra typing, and, as a rule, you should never extend classes unless you know what you are doing; composition tends to lead to far easier to maintain code. But if your coders just aren't smart enough to understand this, enforcing it isn't magically going to lead to better code. THere are a million-and-one style errors they'll be making. Shooting down 5 of them using a linter is not going to make a dent, is going to make them work around it, is going to resent you for these stupid (to them), pointless (to them), mysterious (to them) rules.

artem_korneev,"In my team some devs started doing it recently, but I don't like it.

I use it for class fields, but not for local variables or input parameters - we are just getting ""var"" keyword in JDK 11 to reduce amount of syntax noise and now that ""final"" keyword makes a step back. I wish they world do ""var"" as ""final by default"", that would give a better effect to contemporary Java code overall.

I agree with the idea itself to not  reuse the same variable for different purposes, but I prefer to enforce it with Checkstyle analyzer. That ""final"" keyword creates too much of syntax noise and I prefer to make my code simple, clean and readable. If some method requires too much time to read it and it is not obvious where some value comes from - that code is bad anyway. Putting ""final"" may possibly help a bit, but I would rather rewrite it to be simple and obvious.
Btw, with enforced ""final"" you will have to have some suppressions for different kind of ""loop variables"". That is one case when changing the variable's value is reasonable.",1540538811.0
tlinkowski,"I tried to find the sweet spot between readability and finality, and I settled upon:

* fields and classes marked `final` by default (with classes it's disputable - as someone mentioned, it's problemtic e.g. with Mockito)
* parameters and local variables **not** marked `final`, but IDE (IntelliJ) highlights **clearly** if a parameter or local variable is not **effectively** final

cran,"Use them where needed. Generally only for constant values, to enforce initialization and otherwise when you're sure a reference should not be charged. Within a class or method, the concept of encapsulation means the developer is in full control.

audioen,"I personally think final is mostly a noise keyword. It had use case back in the days of java 1.7 and before where an inner class required values to be actually final rather than just effectively final to be used within the inner class. In java 1.8 and later, values assigned once are treated as final without you explicitly making them so, and that removed the only reason where I actually had to use the keyword.

Sure, declare things final if you think it achieves a tangible goal. E.g. a class member declared as final requires that there must be a value written to it during constructor, so you can kind of guarantee that in every constructor, an added member will get initialized because the compiler will complain until you do so. I kind of have a pattern of passing dependencies in the constructor and they're all final. I sometimes also have a switch-case that computes a value and I declare the value as final to guarantee that there is only at most 1 assignment to that value in every code path, which helps with stuff like forgetting to ""break"" the ""case"" statement or something.

I would definitely not mandate use of final. I think it's hampering code evolution and something that the compiler can infer if necessary. Most of the time, I think that it adds no value. For instance, I see no reason to force it with method parameters.",1540567663.0

I'd say the sign of an immature team is if they let you do this. New person comes in, reads marketing and ""sounds like it makes sense"" imposes it one the team. I have seen this happen several times...and almost always the resulting code is a nightmare to work with. ""We'll do all our database access with hiberate"" -> performance dies and making changes to anything take 5x longer. ""Omg guys akka Futures! We'll put everything in a separate thread so it's faster!"" -> our business rules go from being complex but readable to completeably unreadable with occassional bugs in production that are impossible to track down. I could go on...  

> This will encourage good practices and get people thinking in terms of dependency injection and immutability of object references when being passed between functions.  

What it will do is encourage everyone to get into a competition over who controls what how everyone else is supposed to code. This can be ok if you have fairly smart people who also work to recognize their own mistakes. But - I say from experience - once you open up this can of worms everyone will be competing to try to add their own ""thing"" into the project and you'll have to deal with that.  

I do not think that ""thinking in terms of dependency injection"" is inherently a good thing. I haven't found it terrible either, but it really hasn't improved things vs factory methods for me. If you had 10 bazillion factory methods before now you'll have 10 bazillion dependency injections instead.  

I think ""everything final"" is straight up a bad idea. This idea has been tried over and over again since the 70's and nothing has changed. About every decade something thinks it will great, real developers who need to develop real code that actually works try it. They decide it is inferior to mutable languages and everyone uses mutable languages.  

A decade goes by...they try it again...same result...  

The fundamental problem is that programs do need to edit/mutate data. In a constant-only language, when you need to mutate existing data, you have to create a copy of the entire object tree just to change 1 variable. Imagine having 15 copies of the same object because you needed to edit it 15 times...you can probably see why this causes bugs and huge headaches in trying to debug code.  

There's only 2 places where I see it work ok:  
1\. Editing data really only takes place on the client (browser) or in the sql, so the code never actually mutates anything. The thing there is you're not gaining anything either.  
2\. It works ok for objects that are conceptually a single concept. Like immutable Date isn't an issue (though perhaps had they spent their time on a decent date api rather than wasting time and thought on immutability it wouldn't have taken until Java 8 to get ok Data manipulation). Immutable String's work ok...though note that there's 2 ""mutable string"" classes in the jdk, so now you have at least 3 ways to represent a String.  

But that's where you always end up - either it's not an issue because your code wasn't changing properties to begin with, or if your code is changing properties it becomes a nightmare when you have objects that refer to other objects that refer to other objects...you need to change a property and you have to copy the entire object graph.  

P.S. One more thing, it's even worse with java. ""final"" doesn't make an object immutable but people think it does. It makes primitives and references immutable, so final int can't be changed but final User can have it's properties changed...it's a mess. Easier to know your variables are mutable than to mentally deal with the mess of some of them being mutable, some of them being immutable, and some of them being immutable references to mutable objects.",1540666291.0
afrotronics,"I use final on constants, and implementation classes/modules that are not public/protected/exported that I know I won't be extending. For visible implementations I use final at the class declaration level usually to prevent developers from overriding methods that should not be overridden as well as preventing accidental field hiding (where you have a field in the subclass that has the same name as the field in the super-class).  Essentially, I use final for developer purposes only, IIRC it is possible (at least in versions of java before 9) to reassign final fields using reflection, so don't expect final to make things immutable. The only type of object that has inherent immutability from the perspective of the JVM are strings in the constants pool which end up in the string pool at runtime.  


If you want things to be immutable you'll need to return a new instance of that object any time some ""modifying"" operation occurs on said object with modified data (which there are many many ways of doing this).  

Also keep in mind that you can't proxy a final class.  Lots of frameworks use Proxy objects (hibernate, mockito, spring,...etc) so keep that in mind. ",1541594162.0
hupfdule,"By the way: I do not use Kotlin, but I think they made one of the worst decisions using `var` and `val` to differentiate between final and non-final variables. `var` and `val` look too much the same to be useful. Looking at some code like

    var var1
    val someString
    val myInteger
    var someOtherInteger

you cannot spot easily enough which of them are final and which are not. So you have the safety by using `val`, but it requires more reading for the developer to spot which variables are meant to change and which not (which is an important _semantic_).",1540540352.0

justyb11,"As u/trlambert1 stated, there isn't a need for a JRE post Java 9's Jigsaw.  For Java 11 you just don't get one.  There's the JDK and you will use the JDK to build a JRE to distribute with your program.

So if all of that sounds weird, it is because I think we've all become used to the notion of downloading the JRE and then running our applications with the standard JRE.  In Java 9 and onward there's a new tool called *jlink* that I assure you, you'll want to get **very** comfy with what it is doing and how it works.  Basically if you write a simple ""Hello, World"" program, technically speaking your program only needs the String.class (entry point has String \[\] args), System.class (provides the System.out), and obviously the Object.class (since everything in Java derives from Object).  Additionally, you'll need the WhateverYouCalledYourClass.class (I'll call it Whatever.class going forward) as well.  But basically to run your program, at bare minimum you need a JRE that understands those three classes (since your Whatever.class you'll be providing with your program).  That's where modules and jlink come into play.

You'll create a file that explains the dependencies your classes have.  So without getting too deep into how modules work, you'll basically group classes into modules and then those modules will depend on other modules (aka other groups of classes).  In this case the three classes that you need are in a module in the JDK called java.base.  So you'll take your Whatever.class put it into a APP module and then indicate that the APP module depends on the java.base module.

Phew, that's a lot.  But once you have that all taken care of you'll fire off jlink like so...

    jlink –module-path out –add-modules APP,java.base –output appjre

You can see I have my APP module and the java.base module here and the output is ""appjre"".  After that command is done, if I going into the appjre folder (since that's where I indicated the output to be sent) and look in the bin folder within that, you'll see a program called ""java"" in there.  You'll use that java command to start your application.

The entire appjre folder is a JRE.  It's literally the JDK's JRE but trimmed down to only contain the things you indicated in the jlink command.  You'll distribute that custom JRE with your application, instead of asking your customers or users to go download a standard JRE, which I think JRE 8 had like 4,500 classes or there abouts.

So before I leave, you might have asked yourself, ""What about native code?""  Because obviously the JRE needs to hook into the underlying OS natively.  Well that's solved via something called JMOD which is a new format not unlike JAR but can handle native code.  Trust me, as you read up on jlink, JMODs will get mentioned.  But yeah, Oracle is positioning this new linking and modularization as the future of Java.  Now I would recommend a book at this point, but at the moment there aren't any out.  So you might want to hit the [Java ""books"" here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/books.html) to see what you can glean.

Now that OracleJDK9 and OracleJDK10 are out of the date, the only supported version that remains is OracleJDK8. It's the only one you can use here. You installed OracleJDK8 (or 9 or 10), and these do not silently upgrade to OpenJDK; they downgrade to 8 and stay there. if you want OracleJDK11, pay. If you want OpenJDK11, uninstall oracleJDK and install OpenJDK11. Note, in 6 months, that version will no longer be supported at all and you'll have to upgrade to OpenJDK12.

For my project I have a FXUtility class that has two methods (one for Row/other for Column) that return constraints similar how you do it. But I don't pass the class or pane itself.

Wolfsdale,"You could fairly easily achieve the same with method references (the `some::method` lambda syntax) without giving up type safety. I think reflection is best used when you are really meta-programming, like listing methods and fields and doing things based on their types / annotations. Here you know the methods you want to call ahead of time, so it's more a hack to get some dynamic typing in Java.

You could just write it something like this:

    public <T extends ConstraintBase> void setConstraints(GridPane pane, Producer<T> producer, BiConsumer<T, Double> percentSetter, Function<GridPane, T> constraintsExtractor) {
        .... 
    }

You could then make variants for Column and Row and call this function from that. No duplication, completely typesafe, and even extendable in a way. And you don't have to throw ""Exception""

CaptainFeebheart,"I took an EA position and was disappointed. There’s a difference between software architecture and EA. At least in my experience.

For me, EA was all about org modeling (TOGAF) and platform planning. So, lots of diagrams of organizational hierarchies. Lots of cataloging and inventorying software capabilities, dependencies, interactions, etc. Lots of developing timelines for stuff like “Ubuntu LTS for version 11.10.9 expires on April 3, 2020. So we need to begin testing with version 12 by January, which requires us to upgrade Oracle and switch to Java 10 by October.” It was interesting at first but really was very non-technical.

It did *NOT* involve designing software. It’s a higher-level perspective than that.

Also TOGAF certification is one of the biggest rackets I’ve ever seen.

Watch other videos from architecture conferences. Some popular ones are SATURN, SACON, QConn.

* Raffi Krikorian
* Allen Holub
* Mark Richards
* Chris Richardson

Then start learning how ideas become products. Software architecture is a tough position, you are poised in the middle of engineers, management and product/business. Your job is to help guide those three entities to the best decision for the company, which often means some or all of those parts are not getting everything they want.

At its core, software architecture is about options. Start by designing a small project with alternatives that meet the following. 

1. The best solution if you had all the time and money in the world.
2. The best solution you can live with.
3. The least amount of work possible to solve the problem. 

While designing each alternative. Keep the following in mind. There are so many more concerns you will come to recognize but this is just a short list to start. 

* What is the experience level of the engineering team? 
* Does the team know the technologies or will they have to learn them? 
* Are we designing for impossible scenarios?
  * ex. 10,000 downloads a minute when we only have 25 users per day 
* How do we support this long term?
* How do we _know_ when it breaks? 
* How do we _respond_ when it breaks?
* How do we build off this should our business grows?
* Do we really need this? 

That last bullet is tough to read/write, but honestly may be the most important.

* Don't be afraid to go hardcore and study raw stuff like Servlet, JSP, concurrency the hard way with command line and text editor. You don't have to re-invent the wheel, but knowing what's under the hood will be a great help in your Java career.
* Use a text editor like Vim at first, that's a great way to memorize the important stuff, you can always use any IDE to save some time later.
* Be curious and try to break things, that's a great and fast way to learn.

As for the learning materials, my recommendations are:

* Core Java Eleventh edition
* Modern Java in action second Edition
* [The ""Official""  Java tutorial by oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)

fabio_castas,"Hi, I been studying Java also in a small period of time like yourselfe. And I think the best way to learn is by making a program you enjoy making, even if it already exists. For example I started doing a game with no UI, everything on the console, the best optimized way possible, made tons of perfomance checks so the code would be more smooth. So I think you should start doing something like that, and basically evolve in stages. Since my program is already good without UI. I will add the UI now and always test the performance.

When you start making a program have this concepts in mind:SOLID;Polymorphism;Interface vs Abstract classes;Perfomance testing (Also always search for different ways to solve a problem, you could always do if's to solve most of the problems but there are other ways to solve it, wich make the code cleaner and possibly faster on the performance tests);OOP.

There is no problem in using an IDE btw, I personally use InteliJ, I'm transictioning to VS code simply because my subscription will end soon. Also an IDE makes you more efficient at programming, you just need to understand the syntax and the logic, and you will be fine. Also make sure to use git a lot so you get used to it. If you want to share the project with someone in provate use Bitbucket it's a very good tool.

On Linux by using customized systemd unit files for each Tomcat instance.

Once services are removed, there is nothing to ""uninstall"".  I can throw away a Tomcat folder, or a Java folder (if it is no longer referenced), or an Eclipse folder.  Because they were never ""installed"".

fschutt,"I have worked with DOM-like trees for the past year and I'm not sure if this ""advice"" will help you (I don't know Java beyond hello world). As far as I know, Java sadly does not have pattern matching, which would make visitor-like patterns (for separate node types) a breeze to write. However, regarding traversal and modification, there are a few things that I've noticed to be very maintainable when working with trees:

(1). Don't get stuck on the idea that you can only ever have one tree. Sure it might be more memory efficient to only have one tree, but a `Tree<A> -> Tree<B>` function is way easier to test than a function that mutates data in the `Tree<A>`. For example, both GCC and LLVM have these concepts of ""passes"", which is what I've adapted for my solution. For example, I have a function like this:

    fn transform<T, U, F>(&Tree<T>, closure: F) -> Tree<U> where F: Fn(&T) -> U

which reads as ""transform a tree of type T in to a tree of type U by applying closure F to each element"". Ex.:

    struct A { foo: u8 }
    struct B { blah: u8 }

    let start_tree = Tree::new(A { foo: 3 });

    // Add 5 to each element, in the original tree, return the result as a new tree with x = x + 5
    let end_tree = transform(start_tree, |original_node| B { blah: original_node.foo + 5 });

    assert!(end_tree[0].blah == 8);

Java does have closures in Java 8 and above, I think - these are very helpful for these kind of ""transformations"" without having to write for-loops or recursive functions every time.

(2). Adding on (1), maybe try using a simple vector (I think it's called ArrayList in Java) + indices instead of an OOP-ish ""parent owns its child nodes"". So my ""node"" looks more like this:

    struct Node<T> {
         parent: Option<NodeId>,
         previous_sibling: Option<NodeId>,
         next_sibling: Option<NodeId>,
         first_child: Option<NodeId>,
         last_child: Option<NodeId>,
         data: T,
    }

This makes it easier to:

1. Append / remove trees (just append the array lists at X, then ""shift"" the indices of the following nodes by the added / removed `tree.length()`)
2. Apply operations to the whole tree without using recursion (see (1))
3. Testing indices / relationships of nodes in unit tests
4. Filter / map / reduce by just looking at the node IDs - ex. ""get all parents that have a value of 5"" - `tree.filter(|node| node.first_child.is_some() && node.data.value == 5)`
5. Have cache locality (although idk how much this matters in Java due to GC)

A downside of this is that once you modify the tree, you have to ""fix"" all the indices - and you have the ""overhead"" of 5 * 8 bytes per-node. For my application, it's negligible, since I only have 1000 - 4000 nodes, i.e. 156 KB of extra node index information. For very large trees, you might be better off by mutating the tree instead of creating a new one - but I'd still transform the type (i.e. Tree<TypeA> -> Tree<TypeB>).

(3). If you need to heavily iterate the tree with parent / child relationships, I've found it very helpful to filter out all non-leaf nodes first and sort them by depth. For example, if you have to go from-the-inside-out, you simply go through the non-leaf node IDs in the reverse depth order. Recursion is a fine tool, but I've found it not to be that helpful in practice. Ex:

    for (node_depth, parent_id) in parents_sorted_by_depth {
         for child_id in tree[parent_id].children() {
             do_something_with(tree[child_id]);
         }
    }

At least in my view this is much easier for reasoning about traversal (and especially to reason about if the function ever returns) than the recursive way - and very helpful if you need to filter the children along the way.

(4). Try reducing mutability as far as possible and use types and generics to your advantage. As soon as you (inevitably) have to refactor or change your code, having pure or almost-pure functions helps a lot since the order in which you call the functions / visitors doesn't matter. This also makes it easier to ""chain"" your business logic - ex. a `Tree<SyntaxNode>` can only be built from a `Tree<AstNode>`, so if a class stores a `Tree<SyntaxNode>`, you know that you *have* to call `syntaxNodeTreeToAstNodeTree()` first in order to get that - you can't ""forget"" this when refactoring. 

I know this code isn't Java, but you did ask for FP-like patterns and at least some of these techniques might be adaptable to Java. This does work for me because I only need to generate-the-tree-once and then iterate it a lot. I can't say if these tips would work for you, but it might be worth a try. Especially multiple trees can help you to get around having to write visitors for each node type, because you can just call a function on every node of `Tree<A>` with a function that takes A and returns B, without mutation. Hope this helps.",1540066372.0
jonhanson,"Take a look at [Object Albegras](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2012/ecoop2012.pdf). They're superficially similar to Visitors:

> Object algebras also have much in common with the traditional forms of the Visitor pattern, but without many of its drawbacks: they are extensible, remove the need for accept methods, and do not compromise encapsulation

Note, any recursive tree-walking approach is at risk of blowing the call stack. Recursion is also relatively slow compared to iteration. Consequently, I usually end up converting them to a stack-based iterative approach. This works well for Object Algebras as the transformation logic (the algebra) is already separated from the tree-walking logic.",1540124214.0

hupfdule,"Unfortunately Oracle is trying to give us as less information as possible.
But even if they did we couldn't count on it. When deprecating Java Applets they promoted Java Webstart as replacement (which is a very well decision), but suddenly they announced to drop Java Webstart and didn't give us much time for a replacement.

The same is true for JavaFX, but even more for Swing. JavaFX was taken out of the JDK and given to ""the open source community"". So one could say Oracle doesn't care about whether it will evolve or die.

Swing is still in the JDK, but Oracle made some very vague statements about its future (as stated by https://www.reddit.com/user/dolphin_rave_cape in this thread). So it seems Oracle does not want to explicitly state that 
 they want to drop it, nor do they want to guarantee any future of it.

Oracle (like many others) try to get rid of Java on the Client and propagate the usage of HTTP web applications (and I can't think of anything worse). So it may well be that neither of them has a bright future. However I also would not see it that dark as there are several years to come for both toolkits and every hype (in this case the HTTP/HTML5/Webapp hype) will calm down at some time and the alternatives will be back again.

dragandj,"Hi, I'm [Dragan](https://dragan.rocks/about), the creator of [Uncomplicate](https://uncomplicate.org), a family of Clojure libraries for AI, ML, and GPU high performance computing. All libraries are [free, open source](https://github.com/uncomplicate), and they come with a ton of documentation and tutorials on my blog.

[Neanderthal](https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org is a Clojure library for linear algebra and vectorization on CPU and GPU. 

[ClojureCL](https://clojurecl.uncomplicate.org) brings OpenCL GPU computing to Clojure that supports AMD, Nvidia, and Intel GPU. 

[ClojureCUDA](https://clojurecuda.uncomplicate.org) enables CUDA acceleration on Nvidia GPU directly from your Clojure REPL. 

Bayadera does Probabilistic Data Analysis on the GPU, from Clojure 

Fluokitten brings category theory to Clojure These libraries are quite innovative, are programmed in Clojure, and promote Clojure values of simplicity and elegance, while surpassing competitive libraries from other ecosystem in terms of speed and performance.

See some conference talks about them: EuroClojure 2016, Bob Konferenz 2017, ClojuTRE & SmallFP 2018.

While these libraries can be considered research, they are for Clojure programmers, by a Clojure programmer, 100%. Your contribution can help me proving that this is possible.

I am committed to their continued development, and to writing the guides and documentation that teach how to use them. You can help in making this sustainable by adopting a function from these libraries as your pet and sponsoring my development. Please consider contributing!",1539870089.0

Edit/clarification: ASM 6.2 has experimental Support for Java 11 which has to be enabled by the library to process Java 11 bytecode reliably. Simply upgrading ASM doesn't work.

They cannot (for the most part) download a ZIP of the current OpenJDK and correctly install it, including setting paths etc. According to Oracle, the new Right Way for me to distribute my application is to build a custom binary with a bundled JDK subset for each platform, which means I now have to maintain three build environments on three different platforms, two of which I don't have a license for and one of which I don't have the hardware for. So unless/until some friendly third party comes along with a very user-friendly OpenJDK 11 installer, I have to stick with Java 8.

This is obviously a big change to what application deployments looked like before and developers will probably take a while to move to this new way of doing things. For now, with applications that haven't moved to this model, there are two relatively simple options:

1. Use the Java 8 JRE, as it is still supported. (see https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html) Obviously the application needs to be able to run on Java 8.

There are also fewer hurdles to running Java on Linux, although .NET has come a long way recently.

Build tools and package management is a really big deal.  They run unit tests, deploy code, and help keep library versions in sync across organizations.  Linux servers are more industrial strength compared to Windows, especially with the proliferation of devops (ansible, etc).

The JVM has a huge advantage over the CLR in the way the Hopspot JVM works. It can recompile machine code on the fly as performance metrics indicate better ways to interpret the intermediate code.

The .NET Core version of the CLR is only barely beginning to implement support for de-virtualizing method calls . And it will be years, if ever, before it handles automatic escape analysis.

nutrecht,"I'm currently working as a software engineer for a small consulting company specialised in the Java ecosystem. Before this I worked for a small tech company who did both Java and C# depending on the client's needs. I was mostly tasked with integrating our technology (a search engine) into the client's system but I often also supported the clients on other stuff (like helping them do graceful degradation on high loads and stuff). Small disclaimer; I left that company in 2012 so my experience with C# was mainly between 2002 and 2012, so before .Net Core.

During the 10 years or so I worked there I noticed that while I preferred C# as a language and was quite content with Visual Studio (didn't mind working in Eclipse either), I tended to always gravitate towards Java when building 'stuff'. If I needed to ingest some CVS's for example I would build a Java tool, and not a C# tool. Even before Java 8, which removed a lot of the issues I had with Java. 

The reason was the community: the Java community had by that time fully embraced open source and we have a huge very mature ecosystem of frameworks and libraries. The C# community on the other hand wasn't open: there were ports of Java libraries (nhibernate, nunit) but people tended to keep the stuff they built close to their chests instead of open sourcing it. This culture difference was caused by Microsoft itself. Fortunately they have now figured out they have to change that, and they are working hard to change it, but I really don't believe the C# community is changing all that fast with it.

Just a single example (I know n=1 is pretty meaningless) but one guy I know from uni that is a huge Microsoft fan (back in 1999 he was claiming Java was dead and C# is the future) is often still posting anti-Linux FUD about how Windows is so much easier and that installing stuff on Linux is hard. In 2018.

Another example of this is what used to be a sister company of the company I work for now that were mostly doing Sharepoint consulting. They had the same problem; there was a pervasive anti-OS sentiment there (it's free so it must be crap) that is completely outdated. This is one of the reasons the company is now completely split off; the personalities didn't match. 

So TL;DR: for me it's the community. While microsoft itself is changing I still don't have the feeling the .Net community as a while has embraced the open source 'sharing makes us all better' ideology. ",1539757293.0

Coding is a hobby now, not what I get paid for.  (Though I used to get paid for it, and have a CS degree.)  So I don't get 40+ hours a week to keep on things, and when I write something with 50,000+ lines of code I want it to be able to last a good 20 years.

The standard library is decent and since about 2005 reasonably well-behaved.  The rare times I need more syntax sugar than plain old Java I can turn to one of the other JVM languages like Clojure to fill in.

,"> How common is it to use Spring AOP in real life projects? 

Extremely common. For example, setting up transaction boundaries using `@Transactional`. You can let Spring take care of figuring out when to start a transaction, and committing the transaction or rolling back on exceptions. 

Spring Security makes heavy use of AOP by using annotations to describe the security requirements needed to call the annotated method, and Spring will take of deciding whether it is ok to call the  method.

This is called eliminating cross cutting concerns,  letting your code focus on business logic, instead mixing your code with infrastructure details.

Heavy use of autowiring in Spring is largely due to convenience, and also back in the day, an application without autowiring required that Spring beans be defined using XML, which kind of sucked. 

Modern Spring uses Java config with `@Bean` annotated methods where you invoke constructors yourself. Personally, I like this approach because IDEs know what is going on without specialized plugins just for Spring. ",1539534590.0

gandaroth,"Autowiring and AOP have their use cases. Neither should be avoided nor should either be used to solve all problems thrown your way. 

Particularly, reserve AOP for problems that are cross-cutting, like Authentication or Authorization type problems. AOP is an exceptional solution to this type of problem because it helps avoid coupling (authentication) code to all of your web or presentational layer. AOP however does introduce some extra overhead (probably only a few CPU cycles) to check if the pointcut applies and then to execute code defined for that pointcut. If you have a lot of heavy operations running in this time, then you'll notice the slowdown vs not running those operations at all. But generally it's just a way to wrap some sections of an application with specific code that's needed across multiple unrelated parts. 

Autowiring is another story though. It is extremely useful to inject any beans you need into your classes. I would caution against using Field Injection as that couple's your code testing to Spring and you'll require bean injection. If you go the autowired constructor route, then testing is as simple as setting up dummy or mock classes for everything in the constructor and creating a new instance of your class under test with the constructor. To be honest,  I'm not sure why you would want to avoid autowiring altogether because it's a relatively integral part for the Spring IoC container. But keep in mind, the larger an application, the more beans you're creating, the more complex the autowiring/bean dependency graph becomes, and the longer the IoC container requires to start up. 

I'm not sure how well that addresses your questions but dependency injection with Spring's Autowire (single constructor classes don't need an explicit autowired annotation on their constructor, recent versions of Spring assumes you want it autowired) is very common and I'd be skeptical of anybody that tried to give an absolute for or against it, or any technology for that matter.

i_post_things,"Proxy classes at very minimal overhead: YMMV, but [A proxied class adds approximately 500ns to the transaction](https://spring.io/blog/2007/07/19/debunking-myths-proxies-impact-performance/).

In the real-world if you are doing a database query that takes 1ms (which is insanely fast for a database query that might include network time) and wrap that query in some sort of logging or @Transactional AOP that takes 1000ns, you're adding an extra 0.001% overhead.

The math they provide:

>  100,000 proxy operations * 500 ns per proxy operation = 50 millisecond

It's something that I would really only be concerned about if you are performing millions or billions of 1ms transactions per second and really needed to squeeze every bit of performance out of it.

If that's the case, you can look into something like Aspect4j, which can use bytecode weaving.  Using bytecode weaving, you can reduce the overhead to <10ns.

Bytecode weaving via Aspect4j also allows you to wrap private methods and non-bean classes. You can do really weird stuff l[ike wrap constructors, assignments, static initializers, and other areas normally off-limits to Spring-based AOP](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-aop-vs-aspectj).

I would assumed that is what is used when I use Hystrix annotations.

I also use my own pointcuts for external system calls and wrap them up in [Spring Retry templates](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry).  You can wrap things like JDBC, RestTemplate, or some other I/O calls in an aspect and provide a retry mechanism.

electrodraco,"Why do you want to do it like that? What's your reason to split it up instead of keeping it on the same container?

If you need to do that, I wouldn't go for a restful API between. It feels like a whole lot of unnecessary boilerplate. Injecting remote EJBs living on the backend into JSF component seems much cleaner. In fact, there isn't even much of a difference whether the EJBs live on a different server or on the same container. It's merely a matter of configuration.

Going from Java to REST to Java to Web seems unnecessarily complicated to me. Maybe there's another frontend (like an app) connecting to the backend? In that case I would build a REST API that connects to the EJB for this app and still directly connect the JSF frontend to the EJBs. But connecting to Java containers over REST looks like a detour to me.

If you have a backend using a JPA and a frontend with JSF, the natural API between the two are EJB. And if there's a server boundary between, remote EJB over RMI is the obvious solution. That's literally what it's built for.

- The updates, whenever available, get downloaded in the background, in a different folder: let's say, app2, and updates the properties file.

EDIT: A word.

Second EDIT to address the IBM thing:

What IBM is getting at here is support, like patches and what not.  Oracle changed how they're releasing and supporting Java with patches and fixes for exploits.  IBM doesn't really like that change and are going a different path.  As such, they recommend that you stick with their distribution of Java to ensure you're covered with IBM support.  So if you have a support contract with IBM, you'll want to use IBM's Java as opposed to anyone else's like Oracle's or OpenJDK.

And at the same time it was difficult to work with guys who stuck on technologies or certain patterns and concepts.

PotatoAmigo,"I actually disagree with quite a few of the answers here. I was promoted from a junior to senior about a year ago so feel like I'm in a good position to answer this question.

Firstly as strange as it sounds I wouldn't worry too much about the java side of things. Sure you should have a good understanding of the language and how to write good, effective, clean code but in terms of frameworks and patterns I would say that they all come with practice and you'll naturally learn these things if you're working with them/other who use them.

I think what would really benefit a junior developer is a good understanding of git. It's amazing how many people don't fully understand this tool and it stops them doing their job effectively. Sure it can be fairly complicated and you don't need to know everything but you should have at least some understanding of git workflows and what branches/PRs/merging is.

Secondly I suggest learning maven/gradle, again these can be fairly complicated but when you use them everyday at work an understanding of what it does and how it works is vital in troubleshooting/getting started on new projects. Again at the last place I worked so many people didn't understand these tools and when anything went wrong they would have to ask for help from ""maven people"" i.e people who know how to do their job. 

Finally I'd say intellij (or the ide of your choice), when you first get in you'll have no idea what is going on, what all the shortcuts do or mean but if you get a good basic understanding of the IDE as your knowledge of Java/frameworks/maven/gradle improves you will find yourself understanding more and more about what the different buttons do and why it's so helpful.

I'm in sort of a unique position because I'm a ""junior"" dev in the sense that I've only done it professionally for 3 years, although I'm 49 and have actually been programming since the 80s. (I spent 20 years in the military first.)

Anyway, besides the technical skills that others have recommended, here are some crucial skills that will help you make it:

* Learn to be able to take constructive criticism on your code. Actually, not just take it, but seek it out, realizing that it will make you a better programmer.

* Learn to never be afraid to ask questions and to admit when you don't know how to do something. Most more senior devs that I've worked with (and I have to admit that I've been lucky to work in a professional, non-toxic environment) are more than happy to share their expertise.

* Accept that others may have a different programming style than yours; this doesn't make them wrong, just different.

* This was the toughest thing for me to learn: for anything but the most trivial assignment, you need to plan it out, on paper, in advance, before you write any code.

* Learn to properly document your code, both through comments and in a separate document. This is incredibly hard to do, at least for me, because it's just not fun. But you have to understand that, even if you leave, some poor schmuck is going to have to maintain your code.

* Most important, recognize that your job isn't to write code. It is to make your company more successful than it would have been without you. **That** is why we take pride in our work, **that** is why we write good comments and put up with code reviews and write documentation and all the ""non-fun"" stuff.",1539409314.0

TheRedmanCometh,"How far along are you? You need for certain stuff like SQL, Java8 knowledge, basic concurrency, etc. You absolutely need to know those things, and you need to know every non-trivial detail of abstraction. You might get handed a legacy project as a jr dev with some WTF type abstraction. You need to know how multi-cross-inheritance (that may not be the right term) classes, etc interact. It can get much hairier than you think. Think up the most ridiculous things you possibly can and write abstraction models for them. 

As far as libraries go once you're pretty good Spring framework is the most amazing thing I've ever come across. 

Spring boot is cool and shit, but learning the spring core down to the bones is extremely useful. Both for you as a developer knowledgewise, and your utility. 


What I'd do is learn spring, learn how to autowire, learn qualifier, learn JPA, all the repository types in spring, and learn hibernate. Then learn HQL down to the core because that shit is super important.


Once you can connect hibernate and spring learn some frontend stuff. Reactjs is actually really solid. A lot of people have seen me say stuff in this subreddit against js frontends but uh...man I was wrong. 


Once you have those 3 pieces all you really need is Spring Security, and you can make some pretty serious enterprise applications. If you get into using google cloud SQL with spring and such you can do (very) basic distributed systems as well. 


So yeah I'm pretty much sold on Spring. Others can provide you with another perspective, but to me the Spring+Hibernate stack is here to stay. The only thing changing is the frontend technology you use to interact with it. 


EDIT: By the way spring will be VERY intimidating at first. Just take a deep breath, sit down, and learn piece by piece. Everyone started on this stuff from a place of complete ignorance. We all had moments we screamed at our monitor. This shit is hard it's why we're paid well to do it, but once you master it, man it's so cool.

ZimmiDeluxe,"Regarding the default constructor approach: Are there use cases where the default value for a value type must be computed for each value? The only reason I can think of is side effects in the default constructor, but that seems dangerous: the developer has to be aware of all cases where the default constructor is called implicitly, seems very easy to get this wrong.

My point is: If the default value can be customized, it should be a constant. I imagine it would be more efficient to insert that constant everywhere instead of running arbitrary code for each value.

Terrible strawman syntax:

    public __ByValue Fraction {
        __default = new Fraction(1, 1); // only run once (somehow)
        
        int numerator;
        int denominator;
        public Fraction(int numerator, int denominator) {
            if(denominator == 0) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException(""denominator must not be 0"");
            }
            this.numerator = numerator;
            this.denominator = denominator;
        }
    }

That doesn't *code like a class*, but maybe it's close enough?

As a sidenote: If we can change what *coding like a class* means in the future, it could be fine. Today, classes behave semantically like:

    public class Optional {
        __default = null;
    }

Maybe we can someday say something like:

    public class Optional {
        __default = Optional.empty();
    }

My internship really helped me, I SUCKED at programming when I started.

javelinRL,"The new JavaFX JARs are *always* platform-dependent, regardless of what you do or don't do or how you attain or build them. I'm not a JavaFX expert but this is necessary for several reasons, including using faster native code, interfacing with the OS GUI and 3D layers and drastically reducing the package's file size.

Theoretically, you *could* have a single JAR but it would be pretty big as far as libraries go and either be way too complex to produce or be way slower to run by not using any native code (or doing so dynamically). It's a trade-off and they chose to go with having separate JARs, which seems right for me.

One of the reasons I stick to Java is its philosophy of ""write once, run everywhere"". Sadly, as of Java 11, all deployment expectations have changed and you shouldn't expect people to have a JRE or JDK installed - now you're supposed to provide your own (platform-specific) binaries with each application through `jlink`. In that sense, platform-specific JavaFX JARs are completely a non-issue right now - and I don't think anyone's going to convince Oracle to go back to the way things were before.

On one hand, it's a shame that the simple ""JAR double-click"" doesn't cut it anymore and you cannot expect people to have a fully up-to-date Java installation at every single computer anymore. On the other hand, users don't need to install and update Java themselves, we get compile-time dependency sanity and link-time optimization (which I imagine is gonna be huge moving forward), our bundled JVMs are pretty small compared to how it used to be, etc...

It's not the Java we were used to up to this point but I'm OK with it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ if anything, I'm happy to see the language evolving again, on the fast track - especially when it comes to syntax improvements!

Sorry for the rant, I was up until 1AM yesterday getting very intimate with `jlink`, modifying build scripts and figuring out cross-platform deployment so this topic has been very close to my heart right now, I've been thinking a lot about the pros and cons of it.

_INTER_,"> Why not try it with your applications?

jlink would be great if you could make it work easily, however anything that is beyond a simple hello-world project contains at least a dozen third-party libraries. All of them should be modularized and their transitive dependencies aswell. Not just an automatic module name. Even if you inject a passable module-info you need to make sure there are no split-packages. This is likely going to fail even with ""basic"" libraries such as slf4j and junit.

> It's what Oracle has been saying since 1995

oracle specifically provided the reflection api to access this stuff and for 20 years everything was fine - occasionally the internals changed in the process of oracle improving something and people had to fix a few usages that depended on it

and it was a great middle ground - 99.9% of the time, you used stable apis and could count on them. and oracle didn't have to have the API perfect at launch because in a pinch you could access the details or speed things up dramatically with unsafe. the tech stacks that have been popular for the last 10 years all leverage internals - a big performance and functionality win at the cost of a bit more maintenance

what we're seeing today isn't change for the sake of improving things - this is a concerted campaign specifically designed to **break** things and lock end users into vendor products (and as you mention add a few new stable apis to replace 80% of the non-stable functionality people were using)

have you looked through your favorite tech stacks and checked all your dependencies to see what you're accessing via reflection and unsafe ?

    Map<long,Map<String, MyObject>> map = new HashMap<>();

It's wise to know about version control. Most likely Git or Subversion. The company you work for is more than likely to be using it.

You want to know how to decompose a problem cleanly into helper/sub-problems. Also, the fundamentals of Java's memory-model (everything's a reference; what lives on the heap and what's on the stack, and ideally how that might be different in C or Rust).  But 45% of your job is knowing fairly-specific-libraries (e.g. Spring or other frameworks), and 45% is knowing the architecture/organization of the projects you'll be thrown in to.  Those last two, you'll pick up when you're working 40-50hrs/wk for months straight.

(Oh, and the remaining 25% is knowing how to communicate well, and be a good team worker.)

Vi0lentByt3,"I graduated in 2016 and have been working professionally Java for 2 years.

before I going to far into a rant. The most relevant java technologies today are:
Spring/Spring-boot, HTTP libraries for building RESTful web services, JMS(so Message Queues and async message passing), testing(Junit, TestNG, cucumber), CI/CD build  pipelines(bamboo, jenkins, travis) and VCS(git and svn are core to any major company these days). 

for tech in general Cloud services are becoming more critical by the day so AWS is always a solid choice, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Heroku, Google Cloud, and Azure are all the major ones. 
knowing your OOP is crucial, the core 4 qualities: abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism. 
coupling and cohesion and SOLID are concepts you should at least know about but don't need to explain in great detail, also LEARN SQL

So, there are a few things to know for **finding a job and getting hired**. 
At the entry junior level all the interviewer wants to know are 3 main things. 
1. are you a good fit culturally and can you communicate effectively?
2. are you a good problem solver and know where your knowledge begins and ends?
3. do you have a passion for learning and technology 

While there are a variety of other topics or more specific things employers are looking for, the core of what they are looking for can be summed up on those 3 points.

Now for some details:
1. they want to know if you will get along with how they do things there. Can you follow instructions? you will be taking direction from Tech Leads and Senior Devs. Can you communicate properly? I can't tell you how many problems are just failures to communicate whether it be technically or in code. do you have a good attitude? are you excited to work there, have you done your research on the company and know what they do and some of their stats. You need to show you care about what they do.

2. this one is much more dependent on the company. the top-level firms(Google, Amazon, Microsoft etc. and even top-tier start ups) will ask you to solve problems with code or psuedo code and you will be expected to talk through your thought process and explain your decisions. For most other businesses they will want to know how you approach probelms and what aspects of problem solving you find most important, like communication is key to design the minimal solution that works. Draw from your past projects and experiences and dont be afraid to talk about how you struggled and how it made you better. interviews love stories of growth and how problems that you found challenging were overcome.

3. This is not always a necessity, but is something that I have noticed separates the good from average. Showing that you care about the day-to-day skills of subjects is a foundational quality that creates good professionals, it means you work on side projects in your spare time, you read articles on Java, and you post in forums like this one!
Passion can never be taught or learned, you either have it or you don't.

You will need to be familiar with Object Oriented topics, like SOLID and the principals behind what makes OOP useful as a programming paradigm. 
SQL will never go away so learn SQL, ORM will never replace it. Most people right out of college aren't using frameworks because they have to learn the concepts and principals behind those frameworks that make them useful. So, do not worry at this point about having experience in that space.  

I hope this helps in your job search

Everyone expects you to know nothing. Don't worry about learning the frameworks beforehand, try to understand the fundamentals of Java as good as you can, though. First half a year or so you are probably producing less value than your salary is to the company and that's okay, it's a learning period. Just have an open mind. Don't be afraid to ask for help. No one is going to care how much of colleagues help you used during an assignment, as long as you learn from it and the result is a completed assignment.

dballz12,"If your a junior dev they’re gonna focus on OOP design questions, mostly(inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation). I can almost guarantee they’ll as you to list those and explain. Difference between abstract class and interface. Different types of collections(maybe). White-boarding exercises will be along the lines of FizzBizz, reverse a string, traverse a tree,  fibonacci sequence. 

What’s big now is restful services, spring/spring boot, and some sort of database work will be asked. These are probably not required as must haves for a junior but help. 

If you have a github account, that helps. The source control knowledge will help but might not be a must have, either.

As a junior - they will want to see problem solving skills and how you think more than anything. If you aren’t sure how to do something, talk through your thinking, you don’t necessarily have to get it completely right.

Lastly - display a passion for the tech and a willingness and eagerness to advance your skills. Good luck!",1538871087.0
mighty_warrior,"You should know that as a recent grad an employer expects you to know nothing but the simple basics. A good employer will be hiring you for your potential, not any specific knowledge around tools or frameworks that may have been mentioned in this thread. 

Each company is different, uses different tools, frameworks, methodologies, etc. For example, I have seen spring/hibernate mentioned in this thread a few times. My shop doesn't use it, your knowledge around would just be ignored in an interview. Instead show you're eagerness to learn, that once hired you can quickly become a contributor. 

So I would suggest that you spend your time reading blog posts, and books. Follow some prominent engineers on twitter. The things you learn in blogs and on twitter are great conversation starters in interviews and it tells potential employers you have an interest in the field.

Sipkab,"I don't know any tool that does this, but I actually find this problem kind of interesting.

There could be two approach to this:

1. Scanning the source files
2. Scanning the already compiled files

Scanning the source files could be done, via parsing them first and searching for the appropriate source elements. This is not straight forward, as you don't want to write your own Java source parser, and you would have to update this program with the language updates. Luckily, the JDK [provides an API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jdk/api/javac/tree/index.html) to parse Java source files. This can be combined with the [compile API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/jdk.compiler-summary.html) to only parse the files, but not compile them (by only calling [parse() on the JavacTask](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jdk/api/javac/tree/com/sun/source/util/JavacTask.html), but not analyze and generate). When the files are parsed, you can examine the created source trees for the elements you'd like to select.

If you have already compiled the files, then it would be easier to use a class file parser library like [ObjectWeb ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) and select the elements as you like.

I think both approach is viable, the second one is probably easier to implement, but it requires the sources to be already compiled.

There is also the javap program included in the JDK, which disassembles the classes on the CLI, but AFAIK it can't be used to filter elements like you'd like to do.",1538818638.0

OpenJDK, the source repository, is free and open source. Oracle is the only one with commit rights.

OpenJDK, the distribution, is built off of OpenJDK-the-repo, by Oracle, and is free to use and download. Note, it becomes an unsupported product (Oracle wont host the binaries, and even if security updates are available, oracle will not release updated binaries) the day a newer java version is released (new versions are released every 6 months). You may have heard about 'long term support' versions: That doesn't count here. Even OpenJDK11-binary (11 is an LTS version) is supported for only 6 months, until the first OpenJDK12 binary is released.

OracleJDK, the distribution, is built off of the exact same OpenJDK-the-repo, and is basically the exact same thing, except with a few oracle tools added. It also has commercial support. _ALL_ versions of OracleJDKs cost money. It's their commercial, for-money, supported offering. These versions are maintained for longer, especially the LTS versions.

AdoptOpenJDK is both a project and the name of the binaries that this project releases (so, this is NOT oracle): Also based on the same OpenJDK-the-source-repo, they try to apply security patches and support them for longer. Free as in beer, free as in libre.

Not at all. It's actively maintained and has had an increase in development ever since it went public on GitHub and Gluon took over some of the management. I would say deprecation chances have gone down. No one can predict the success of a library 5 years from now (where will Java the language be at that point even?).

>I will have to go through some admin overheads to have it bundled with jdk11

The good news is that, like other projects, you rely only on the base module of JavaFX, which is not GUI-specific. This means that you can specify a dependency on that module only and get a very lightweight bundle of properties, bindings and listeners. JavaFX still has a lot of improvements to do on this module alone, but as you found out it's already appealing.

Sipkab,">An annotation on the method.

I don't think this is a good idea, as that would seem that this javadoc improvement is part of the language. (Like @Override and @FunctionalInterface) I'd like to think of javadoc as a separate tooling than the language itself.

>Heuristic inclusion of static methods that return this type.

This is very error prone due to the type of the return type (as you suggested).

>A JavaDoc tag in the JavaDoc comment on the method.

I think this is a very good approach. You can even go further and generalize this a bit like defining a tag and assigning a type to it. And based on the type the tool generates different sections for the method. Like:

     * @docType factory
     * @docType builder

>Methods will have their own summary section

Yes. I don't like mixing different things under the same category as that would just confuse people searching for a specific type of method.",1538644838.0
NoLemurs,"I definitely think this is a worthwhile change. One of the first things you need to do when working with a new class is figure out how to instantiate it. Since half the time the answer is ""some factory method"" that basically requires scanning the entire method list to decide if you're using the best approach which is unnecessarily time consuming.

For ""How to"" JavaDoc seems like the obvious option. Annotations seem like a bad idea for the reasons /u/Sipkab gave. Javadoc has no functional effect on code, and it's important that it's easy to see that distinction. Documentation should never make it harder to be confident what code does. 

As for the heuristic approach, it's a bad idea unless the heuristic can be overridden, and for the reasons already given, it's a bad idea to use annotations to change the JavaDoc behavior. 

JavaDoc tags which can label a method, and default to a heuristic if no tag is provided might work, but only if the heuristic were accurate in the vast majority of cases. If the chance of error in the final docs is high enough, then we're back to just having to scan the whole method list again, and nothing has been gained.",1538658366.0

By the way, have you reached out to them (e.g., Eclipse, JetBrains)?

deep_fried_eyeballs,"In the real world, inputs and outputs of your program are actually linked to sensors and actuators. 

For example, in a rocket, maybe your code would read airspeed, attitude, air pressure, acceleration and write throttle opening, winglets position and send radio telemetry back to ground station. 

In between the two, your code would calculate the adjusted values to output to maintain the expected course. This would run in a tight loop that never ends. Read from sensors, calculate, write to actuators, repeat.

The number of things to track determine how complex the code is, but ultimately it's always that pattern.

Most important for real world code is error handling. If the control loop exits or even just pauses for too long, congratulation, you've just crashed a rocket! So you need to know in advance how to detect and best handle a faulty component or a bug in your code resulting from unexpected conditions. 

Good luck, and happy flying.

",1538604239.0
BluePinkGrey,"Let's take a look at how you might write code that controls a rocket. A rocket is pretty complex, however *we don't need physics to make an outline of the code*. 

The code we're going to outline will control the rocket boosters throughout the flight. Something needs to control which boosters fire, when they fire, and how much thrust they exert. Now, the rocket's flight can be broken down into a few stages:

* Launch stage
* Flight through atmosphere stage (when air resistance has to be taken into account)
* Flight through space (when air resistance becomes negligible
* Payload release stage (rocket's weight is going to change dramatically)
* Atmospheric reentry stage

Given that we're controlling a rocket's flight, it makes sense to have a `FlightController` class. This class stores a `ThrustCalculator` object, which it uses to periodically update the power output of each of the thrusters to balance and direct the rocket's flight. It does so by calling the `CalculateThrustSpecification` function every millisecond, and sending the resulting `ThrustSpec` object to the device controlling the boosters. This `ThrustSpec` object contains information about how much thrust each booster should output. It could, for example, be a HashTable relating `BoosterID`s to `BoosterPowerLevel` objects, but let's not worry about that for now.  

We can keep things simple if we let `ThrustCalculator` be an interface instead of a class. The `ThrustCalculator` interface has two functions: an `init` function, which takes a `BoosterConfigurationInfo` object and a `PhysicsEngine` object as input; and a `CalculateThrustSpecification` function, which takes a `RocketSensorData` object as input, and returns a `ThrustSpec` object. 

By making `ThrustCalculator` an interface, we can have a separate implementation of `ThrustCalculator` for each of the rocket's flight stages. The `FlightController` class switches between them as necessary over the course of the rocket's flight. We'd have a `LaunchThrustCalculator` class, a `AtmosphericThrustCalculator` class, a `NearSpaceThrustCalculator` class, a `PayloadReleaseThrustCalculator` class, and a `ReentryThrustCalculator` class. They work differently under the hood because the physics is different in each case, but they all communicate with the `FlightController` class in the same way, through the `CalculateThrustSpecification` function. It's now easier to add functionality to the rocket. For example, if you need the rocket to also be able to dock, you can just write a `DockingThrustCalculator` instead of rewriting the entire system.

You can't ""proof"" you're a great software engineer by passing some exam with nitty-gritty detail questions on the options of the javac tool and stuff like that.

borkus,"Depending on your definition of an IDE, they predate Java.  Microsoft and Borland had commecial IDEs that were fairly full featured.  Both IBM and Borland had commercial Java IDEs based on other products.  NetBeans was orginally started in 1996 and bought by Sun in 1999.

The main difference was cost - none of them were free and often cost hundreds of dollars.

myleftkneehurts,"IDEs became mainstream several years before Java made its debut.  Tools like Visual Basic, Delphi, and PowerBuilder were already well established and many other 4GL based IDEs were quite common.

Interestingly, the very first Java IDE that I recall was Visual Café from Symantec. In fact the very first iteration of that IDE might have even just been called Café.   It was pretty popular for a short period of time.  I remember getting a free copy at one of the very first JavaOne conferences.

Then Borland came out with JBuiilder which became the significant market leader for several years until Eclipse pretty much killed the market out right.  IBM's first Java IDE was VisualAge which itself was written in Smalltalk of all things.  IBM was a huge investor in Smalltalk for a few years before Java but pivoted quickly and abandoned most of its Smalltalk investments once it made the decision to invest in Java.  VisualAge was, in many ways, ahead of its time but it was HUGE and SLOW.  Even Microsoft had a standalone Java IDE for a couple of years called Visual J++ (damn good IDE).  NetBeans emerged at some point and was (still is) pretty good.  Of course IntelliJ has been around for awhile as well.

&#x200B;

But as  I mentioned, IBM dropped a software bomb and nuked the entire market.  Eclipse become the overwhelming de facto standard for many years.  The growth of Eclipse alternatives like the popularity of IntelliJ today are fairly recent reactions to the bloat of Eclipse.",1538526713.0

TheCrazyRed,"I started Java programming in 1998 using VIM (for Windows) and then Cafe shortly after (not VisualCafe mind you, ""Cafe"").

Compiling from the command line was fine.  We had syntax highlighting at least with those two editors.  But our debugging was essentially done with println statements.

We were fine with it because we didn't really know what we were missing.  I had never really worked with a full featured debugger before and we wouldn't know auto-complete until a few years later (with Slick-Edit) so, we were fine.

But now that I have an awesome debugger, and code assist, code completion, and refactoring going back would be extremely painful.

Sometimes the UI guys I work with will code Java in Sublime and I'm like ""what are you doing?!?  Why would you do that to yourselves?  Of course Java is going to suck if you don't use an IDE.  That's one of the huge benefits of Java is that you can build awesome IDE's!""",1538526011.0

- ant . It is and was quite good. maven is better, of course, but ant had its time.
- makefile. Yes, you can use makefiles to invoke javac
- shell script (bash). depending on how large the project was, there was quite a bit of writing to do.

But, before Java, as editors we had the good old emacs ( vi only if you had a brain haemorrhage), and on ms-dos we had Borland C++  and Turbo C and Turbo Pascal . Not IDE's but quite advanced environments on their own.

Microsoft was still sorta pushing their Java implementation (Visual J++?),  but I don’t think I’d ever heard of anyone using it. 

A year later I started at SunW and found nearly a holy war between VI and EMACS users. With enough knowledge, EMACS functioned as a somewhat complete IDE, I could edit, build (Makefiles), debug (gdb?), and run from a shell anything I worked on.   IIRC EMACS had integrations to source control built in so one could check in and out easily.   Someone I worked with there had an early IDE running, I think it was IBMs, I don’t remember it running well or providing anything more useful than I already had with XEMACS.

dannywoodz,"Imagine having a single monitor (a CRT, of course, 1280x1024), an Emacs window, and Netscape Navigator 4 open on a local copy of Sun's Javadocs (which was available as a downloadable bundle).

Huge external libraries weren't a big thing, so the drivers that led to the creation of Nexus, Maven or Gradle weren't there.  You'd tend to manually download dependencies and stick them in a 'lib' folder in your project.  These would accumulate over time, and upgrading could be painful.

Make was your build tool, so you wrote 'javac' commands directly into it.  Ant came along later.

You had to import classes yourself, and fully type out method names.  Your type checking was done when you tried to compile things, which you did manually (or automatically on save, if you knew how to add post-save hooks to Emacs).

The down-sides are obvious: time spent trawling documentation; context switching between code and docs; typos and mis-spellings.

The upsides?  You became quite familiar with the libraries you were using.  People actually studied the API documentation while not writing code.  And remember, at the time, the dominant language in industry was pre-ANSI C++ (even after '98, as it took some time for compilers to catch up).  This meant that a trivial change to a header file could require an entire system to be rebuilt, which could take hours.  Java allowed you to compile only the class that changed (although you'd still clean and do a full rebuild occasionally, in case someone changed the value of some 'public static int' somewhere, enums being a Java 5 thing and not available at the time).

All things considered, it's still very much worth being able to build your project from the command line, although a build tool with dependency management will make your life much easier (e.g. Maven, Gradle, or Ant + Ivy).  After all, someone's CI/CD system is going to shell out to build your project, and it needs a hook.",1538556758.0

I started with Java 1.0, and worked on some large scale satellite telemetry processing software. We started with make (because there was no ant) and Emacs/VI. We learned fast that make was insufficient, because it could not identify dependencies. There were various dependency tools to try to help that, but in the end, you just rebuilt everything.

coder111,"Ok, to give some perspective.

Java 1.0 came out in 1996. Java 1.2 (I'd argue it's the first really usable version) came out in 1998.

First, you could always use an editor with syntax highlighting + Make. UltraEdit came out in 1994. JEdit in 1998. As far as I remember Midnight Commander had Java syntax support quite early as well. 

JBuilder was available in 1997. Netbeans was started in 1996 as a commercial product, made freely available in ~2000. Eclipse was available in 2001.

So there wasn't much of a gap between availability of Java and availability of IDEs or enhanced editors. The concept of IDE wasn't new by then. Turbo C++ was available for DOS since 1990. Turbo Pascal version 4.0 which could be called an IDE was available since 1987?

For me personally- I started with Make + Midnight Commander on Linux in the university around year 1999-2000. Used Netbeans when I got my first real job in 2001. Kept switching between Netbeans and Eclipse since then. Now I use IntelliJ at my current job, and Netbeans or Eclipse at home.

Numsuccles,"Without a specific example this is all a bit speculative but:

* A good practice is - as you note - to avoid using 'set' when you actually want to do multiple activities.
* A method that does a lot of work could potentially be decomposed such that multiple small methods solve naming issues and your method that calls them all can then be seen as a saveX, buildX, openX or whatever its overall purpose is.
   * Once you can define what needs to happen in the method (if you can't decompose) then see if you can name the method as a way to describe a 'what'( what steps your code will do to solve the problem). Generic names are easy but are less helpful - evaluateX is less useful than calculateProfitOfX. There will always be a trade off between method naming and patterns (if you use a pattern use its example naming) and if you want to create extensible classes then you need to create a more generic interface name. Respect bean naming conventions.
   * A good  rule of thumb is that if a method is longer than your standard development window it should be split up. If you find that your code is getting swamped by lots of tiny low value methods then go back - its a balancing act!
   * If you can identify a significant block of code in a method that can stand alone as a private method then extract it (highlight alt-shift-m in Eclipse) - it will make code easier to read. Try to avoid the temptation to make that extracted method public if you have already published your interface.
   * Small, specific and simply named methods start to create self-documenting code (though never dispense with comments - explaining why is as important as how.) 
* If any setting of instance variables occurs then create and use a setter - that you then refer to that in your method is probably ok as long as your method comments make clear that you are making state changes. A cleaner design is to make state changes after evaluating unless the state change is itself crucial to the evaluation so if possible do evaluateX then do setY rather than setting Y during evaluation of X.
* If you ever have trouble on defining what your method's main purpose is its worth taking a step back and try to describe the flow of information and behaviour to someone (or a duck). If you can describe your flow in defined steps using plain words you have a good chance of creating well defined method names.

**Small!**     
The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that. Functions should not be 100 lines long. Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long.
FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY. So, another way to know that a function is doing more than “one thing” is if you can extract another function from it with a name that is not merely a restatement of its implementation [G34]. Functions that do one thing cannot be reasonably divided into sections.    
   
Notes from Refactoring by Fowler:    
**Chapter 6. Composing Methods**    
A large part of my refactoring is composing methods to package code properly. Almost all the time the problems come from methods that are too long. Long methods are troublesome because they often contain lots of information, which gets buried by the complex logic that usually gets dragged in. The key refactoring is [Extract Method](https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html), which takes a clump of code and turns it into its own method.   
There is also a [cool site](https://refactoring.guru/extract-method), which basically made it more visually appealing.",1538498756.0

joreddit14,"I agree most part of this review. Honestly, I don't spend few hundred dollars for a video course, when there are other sources like packtpub, Apress and Udemy are offering loads of knowledge on the same topic for few tens of dollars.

I personally like 'Pro Spring 5 from Apress' , 'Spring 5.0 cookbook from Packt' and 'Master Java Web Services and REST API with Spring Boot on Udemy'",1538405028.0
eugenparaschiv,"Hey. This is Eugen (the author of the course). Jumping in here with a few quick notes that will, hopefully, provide some feedback to the notes in the review. 

First, the version of Spring. I recorded some of the course material in the Spring Boot 1.2 days - that's why the older version appears in those videos. That being said, I always keep the codebase up to date - it's now using Spring Boot 2. And, whenever a new version actually changes any functionality, I always update the lesson as well. 

However, in a lot of cases, new Spring versions haven't really touched the core functionality. So, on a version where literally nothing has changed from Spring 4 to Spring 5 for example, I upgraded the codebase but didn't re-record the video. 

About going into technologies like Docker and Kubernetes - that's not something I planned to go into, at least not in this course. The material is already an extensive 13 hours and I'm still working through the new lessons - which is why I'm not planning to tackle these as well. 

Next - on the OAuth functionality -  Philip has a good point. This is one of the very rare cases where the Spring core team (more specifically the Spring Security core team) has decided to rewrite rather than evolve. And, so, when that effort stabilizes (as it's beginning to with the very recent Spring Security 5.1 release) - I'll definitely redo those lessons. 

Finally, about the refund policy - I'm quite flexible on refunds and basically very rarely say no. But yes, certainly - when someone literally goes through 100% of the course material and then asks for a refund - I say no. 

Finally, there was another interesting note about authors on Baeldung below. No, I certainly don't pay 5$ for articles. Our average is about 80$: [https://www.baeldung.com/contribution-guidelines](https://www.baeldung.com/contribution-guidelines)

Hope that helps. Cheers, 

Eugen. ",1538424787.0

,"I'm working on my first ""Java""-based app, and I've settled on Spring/Angular. This article explains how I feel about every part of the stack. Everything I read on these subjects is slightly out of date and contradictory with each other.

While I appreciate that Baeldung in that they often are the only third party resource covering certain specific topics, I've never been impressed by the quality of their articles or their business practices.

Articles tend to be shallow, lacking in meaningful examples, and occasionally skip important steps. In one instance, I've noticed that their article was pretty much copied out of the official doc's PDF manual but reworded and with some omissions.

Additionally, when Googling about Spring topics, Baeldung often comes up before Spring official documentation and one could easily mistake Baeldung as official Spring documentation due to the similar color scheme and logo.

Frankly, I'm not at all surprised that their paid for content is crap. It's just a shame that the Java community doesn't have very good third party blogs and tutorials.",1538415824.0

I literally turned off it because it focused so much on using abstract classes and inheritance to implement common RESTful behaviour.

lukaseder,"The perception of the cost / benefit ratio has shifted drastically over the past years, at the cost of quality. The abundance of mediocre, but good enough, free content by platforms with great SEO skills has destroyed quite a bit of classic content markets. Just look at us hanging out on reddit ever looking for the next bikeshed, ever ignoring a high quality link if there ever is one (because: no time, TL;DR) in favour of cheap laughs and blames.

(Depending on your local purchasing power, of course) $ 299 used to be extremely cheap for something like Baeldung's offering, in the ""old days."" But not today, as everyone is competing with free and / or super cheap. You liked Baeldung when it was freemium, and you seem to like Udemy which is super cheap (translates to: content creators get almost nothing). I don't blame you. The market has done this with all of us.

Even if this particular offering didn't fulfil your expectations in terms of quality (and probably rightfully so in some aspects, and surely, Eugen is taking notes where there's room for improvement), you could see your investment as a way to thank Eugen / Baeldung for the tons of free content you've consumed in the past - even if you will, understandably, not purchase from Baeldung again.

oldprogrammer,"Are application servers like Glassfish going to be used in the long term or do we expect to see more self-contained applications?  

In many places I have worked code was split into micro services, each basically a separate WAR file covering a particular capability.

In production it was common to stand up a tomcat engine per WAR file and not run multiple services out of a single tomcat instance.

That started giving way to just simply embedding the server into the service itself using something like embedded tomcat or netty or Spring Boot.

That simplifies the runtime environment as now all that needs to be present is just the java runtime, no pre-install of an application server.  It also makes it a bit easier to use in a cloud environment since the full service is self contained.

Not worth the money, unless you're a total beginner and want something to read on the plane.

By D. Hellumson November 7, 2015

Format: Paperback

With all due respect, the boring stuff was reading this book, which unfortunately I couldn't automate. It is a nice quick and easy reader or tutorial on basic Python programming, downloading offline webpages, and manipulating files, folders, CSV, Excel, Word and PDF, or sending a simple email, but that's it. **What most people really need to automate is ""beyond the scope"" of this book.** For example, it doesn't address how to get past an SSL-based login page to do a web scrape of data in investment portfolios. Few pages of import or usefulness allow unencrypted login, and anyone worth their salt wouldn't do something like that in plain text. **If it can't help me automate the one simple thing I'd want to start with, then why bother?** And why call it ""Practical Programming"" if it's hardly practical? True, it does show me how to scrape weather information and suck it into a CSV file for graphing. Just like my first programming class taught me how to create a video library is. Problem being, nobody needs a weather tracker or a video library. **Bottom line, there are Python primers all over the web for free.** Save your money. Read this at Barnes and Noble over a cappuccino, like I did. Nothing new here, move along...

Infeligo,"TL;DR; Spring WebFlux, both with Postres and Mongo, performed very poorly in that particular test (called Fortunes), worse than non-reactive Spring. It did better in other tests, though. In the Fortunes test the application is required to select a list of data and render a HTML based on that list.

I would very much like to hear from experts about the reasons. Here's what I think:

In case of Postgres, Spring's version uses JDBC (and JdbcTemplate) for accessing the database - a totally synchronous API. It then wraps it into Flux. One of the fastest frameworks - Vert.x - uses a truly reactive and low overhead [reactive-pg-client](https://github.com/reactiverse/reactive-pg-client). However, in case of Mongo, Spring uses reactive Mongo client and that doesn't help much for some reason.

Another problem, I think, is template rendering. Vert.x submission uses the fastest there is - [Rocker Templates](https://github.com/fizzed/rocker). Spring uses Moustache templates, passing it a Flux instance as the list of data. I think that Moustache renderer, when iterating over the collection, just collects everything into a list underneath, so it is a sort of blocking operation. This may explain why Spring WebFlux performs so poorly when tasked to return a HTML, but is better when the result must be a JSON (I think it can streamingly render JSON from a Flux).",1538167241.0

Intent is to help making the _supported_ API of the JDK more well-defined, allowing private implementation details to be modified as needed. So, I believe hacks like these don't really add any fundamental freedoms that weren't already there, they merely make it easier to bend the rules.

- Most reflection is *not* considered illegal since 9: accessing private implementation details in closed, encapsulated packages is.

Short-term, we are probably going to pay Oracle a significant amount of money for Java licensing. However, management is very unhappy with Oracle's behavior and they have been placed on a vendor blacklist, so going forward any use of Oracle technology in new projects requires additional justification and approval. This includes their RDBMS (!), which we use for 99% of our systems today.

Mid- to long-term, I see this accelerating our move away from Java on the desktop. We will be moving to OpenJDK on the server-side (free LTS from our Linux distro partner), which will probably also accelerate our move away from WebLogic. Finally, there is some grumbling about moving to alternate technology stacks entirely. While this might get some traction, I think the likelihood is very low.

FYI, if you're about to start this upgrade, here are the pitfalls to watch out for (we're currently on JDK 10, btw, as a stepping stone to 11)

&#x200B;

1) Java 9 JDK modules. If you're using something like JAXB, you'll find it won't work. If you don't want to configure the whole module system, just add it as a third party dependency and everything will be good.

&#x200B;

2) Java 9 ClassLoader changes. My company used some common ClassLoader hacks to add application extensions at runtime. These no longer work. I figured out a way around it, but it was... interesting. If you need suggestions on this front, message me.

&#x200B;

pron98,"> It is a major release because it has long-term support (LTS).

I find this baffling. A ""major version"" has both a popular connotation and a (compatible but) more specific and precise meaning for OpenJDK. While it is true that according to some reasonable interpretations of the (rather vague) popular connotation Java 11 is a major version, according to the same interpretation so are 10, 12 and 13. According to the more specific and precise definition of OpenJDK, Java 11 is *not* a major version, and neither are 10, 12 and 13; one of the main goals of the new release model is to make upgrades easier by doing away with major versions altogether, and Java 9 was the last. Because the meaning of a new version number has changed *radically*, so has the name (feature releases and feature releases with LTS). I understand the author thinks that an LTS release is a particularly *important* one, but I don't understand why use old terminology that no longer applies, especially if the goal is to clarify rather than confuse.

GoodNamesTaken73,"I'm not here to argue if it's an intentional trap,  poor documentation on Oracle's part, or just links that haven't been updated yet... but I saw the thread and it looks like others are having the same questions I have.

I've been reading through the documentation to see what we need to do as a company to stay compliant.  Maybe I haven't found the right documentation yet, but there is still a lot of confusion for me.  

The one thing that seems clear to me is this that the license has changed and if you want it for free, then use OpenJDK ([http://jdk.java.net/11](http://jdk.java.net/11))

&#x200B;

What isn't clear to me is this:

* There is a Windows download on that page for what I assume is OpenJDK, but it is in Zip format.  I'm not sure how to install it.
* If you follow the installation instructions on [http://jdk.java.net/11](http://jdk.java.net/11) take you the corporate download page - there aren't any instructions on how to install OpenJDK that I could find.  It's still pretty early in the release of 11, so I'm assuming that this is an error, and they still need to publish the OpenJDK installation instructions?
* We have only ever needed JRE to run web apps...is JRE is included with OpenJDK  - I think someone in another thread was able to point me in the right direction with this one - but I can't test it because I can't install the contents of the zip file.
* What about our x86 clients?  Will we need to purchase support to keep getting security updates for  JRE 1.8 x86?

I don't work with Java unless I absolutely have to - which is just mainly pushing updates to it.  So it's likely that I have missed something somewhere that spells this all out clearly.   

My biggest hurdle right now is getting OpenJDK 11 installed so I can have people testing their apps with it.   If anyone can provide some clarity, to any of the questions above, that would help me a lot.

I also really appreciate the suggestion about non-reflection DI with Dagger. I loved using it when I was doing Android development and wondered about the potential applicability here. 

So it sounds like Graal might be a viable approach (relatively?) soon given the right circumstances- possibly suitable for green-field microservice development that involves few dependencies. 

Some questions or follow-up suggestions: 

1. Performance- The headline start up time and container image size is really impressive, though if love to hear if there's a CPU and memory advantage when under load against a fully warmed-up JVM.

2.  Tooling/Ecosystem- What tools are upcoming or available to simplify the build, configure, and support of Graal-based services? What gaps do you see that would need to be addressed before you'd be confident putting a such a service in production? ",1537924772.0

I wonder why did they remove desktop auto-updates...? It's almost as if they are planning on breaking backwards compatibility soon and don't want random Java stuff breaking for desktop users...

Also why are all the of the rationales involved in the removal of auto-updates, Web Start, JavaFX, JMC, etc. ""not public""? Like I don't mind security stuff being not public but these things...? You pretty much just have to assume that they're hiding some upcoming plans that most Java developers and users aren't going to like what's in there... Highly suspicious!

If the caller doesn't expose an interface to let you mutate its state, then it doesn't want or expect you to.

If you DO control the caller, then there are a lot of options. You could, for example, have changeDog return the new dog instance and then in the calling code, do `d = changeDog(d);`. You could also modify properties within the given Dog instance if they're writable.

It's worth mentioning that industry trends seem to be favoring ""pure"" functions. A pure function is a function that, given the same input, will always return the same output and never has any side effects (so no mutating state outside its own scope).",1537642295.0

Almost anything you want to do can be done with microservices. Whether it's a good idea is something different though. But in the end you're the one's who have to create it and enjoy working on it. So try to figure out a subject together first and foremost, then figure out how to create an application for that, and then figure out how to split that up into different services. 

For example; if your application will let users log in you could have a 'users' service that stores everything related to a user. ",1537515804.0
errandum,"A springboot application would do most of the configurations for you.

But to support microservices you need some way to either share the session between nodes, configure a front layer that actually always routes you to the same application instance or use something like JWT (this is the way I'd go).

Otherwise you're not a microservice, you're just a web application done in spring boot.

* **Fetching only the data you really need**: That's such a low hanging fruit, regardless of what clients / servers are communicating
* **Streaming pitfalls**: This is also applicable to many system interactions where data is transferred from A to B. As soon as data gets bigger, streaming is the way to go, and buffering is not.
* **Optimizing the number of database roundtrips**: Replace ""database"" by ""server"", and you get again some very general advice. Vlad mentioned the fetch size, which helps. But the elephant in the room is N+1. Don't send 1000 queries to the server if you can send only 1 doing the same thing. [I've also blogged about this in the past](https://blog.jooq.org/2017/12/18/the-cost-of-jdbc-server-roundtrips/)
* **Statement batching**: This is the same as the previous *""Optimizing the number of database roundtrips""*, but using a different technique
* **Connection management**: This is the same as the previous *""Optimizing the number of database roundtrips""*, but using a different technique
* **Database-level processing**: Again, as mentioned before, don't implement parts of your data processing logic in the client, when you could have moved that logic to the server. Ideally using SQL queries. If you must, using stored procedures.
* **Caching**: Obviously, again general advice

These ones are Hibernate and/or JPA specific:

* **Open Session in View and temporary session anti-patterns**
* **Read-only queries**: Although, I'd say use SQL for read only queries, not entities
* **Mapping**
* **Query plan cache**

'OpenJDK, the source repository' is a mercurial-based open source repository, hosted at (hg.openjdk.java.net)[http://hg.openjdk.java.net]. It is THE java source code; whilst oracle does maintain a small 'add-on' patch for a few features they want to ship specifically for their 'OracleJDK' product (see later), the vast majority of java features (from the VM to the core libraries to the compiler) are based solely on this source repository, oracle (nor any other major player) have an alternate fork of this.

'OpenJDK, the distribution' is a distribution (binaries, in a zip or installer, offered for various platforms, on a website, possibly with a support contract) provided by Oracle. It is free as in beer and kinda free as in speech, but, as is normal for free as in beer products, you do not get to call oracle if you have problems with it. There is no support contract. Furthermore, oracle will only release updates to any OpenJDK (the distribution) version if that release is the most recent java release. This even includes LTS! So, the day oracle releases OpenJDK (the distribution) version 12.0, even if there's a security issue with OpenJDK (the distribution) version 11.0, oracle shall _not_ release an update for 11.0.

AdoptOpenJDK is a distribution. It is very similar to Oracle's OpenJDK distribution (in that it is free, and it is a build produced by compiling the sources from the hg.openjdk.java.net OpenJDK source repository), but unlike oracle's distribution they WILL support versions for longer, particularly the LTS-marked versions (currently: Java 8 and Java 11 are LTS).

OracleJDK is another distribution you may have heard of. Starting with JDK12 there will be no free version of this whatsoever, the point of OracleJDK is simply to be oracle's JDK distribution offering intended for commercial support. You pay for this, but then you DO get to rely on oracle for support. Unlike Oracle's OpenJDK offering, the OracleJDK offering DOES come with longer support for LTS versions. As a developer you can get a free license for personal/development use only of this particular JDK, but that's mostly a red herring, as 'just the binary' is basically the same as the OpenJDK binary. I guess it means you can download security-patched versions of LTS JDKs from oracle websites as long as you promise not to use them commercially.


TL;DR: Go to AdoptOpenJDK to download your binaries for all platforms. Donate time and/or money if you like the fact that someone is putting in the effort to build and compile the openjdk, make nice installers, host these on servers, and backport security fixes.

That's actually kind of common - delegating the implementation of an interface to a member.
But it's not really that much less boilerplate if you still have to delegate on a method level - there could be something like

    class DelegatingList<T> implements List<T> {
        // 'delegate' meaning all non-implemented List methods are created for this class and delegated to aList
        private delegate List<T> aList;

This feels like it's solving a non-problem. Not once have I ever felt that I was unable to complete a project on time because I had to type some curly braces for trivial methods. On top of that, I don't even type them - my IDE does, so I actually type the same number of characters the ""long way"" today as I would in the ""short way"" described here, so it doesn't affect my coding velocity at all.

What it does do is make code significantly harder to read/understand because now you're overloading the arrow/method-reference notation. Currently it's limited to method invocation but now you're suggesting that it could be used while defining methods, too. It requires extra (unnecessary) brain cycles to figure out where the method definition ends and what it's actually doing - especially in the examples w/ multiple arguments.

It's unnecessary complexity that adds to the amount of mental cycles required to consume existing Java code - which is 90% of our jobs. This will make reading Java code harder while having 0 effect on our ability to write code efficiently.

In the logging and throwing section, it's probably worth mentioning that sometimes you want to add extra context to your situation, in which case it's a good idea to wrap the exception in a custom exception with that information. I'd also mention that because exceptions are just Java classes, you can create custom fields inside them to record all the required information. For example, if you have a `AccessDeniedException` you could create a constructor that takes a username and name of the resource they tried to access, as well as any additional message.

jonhanson,"I've used a few of them and they all have there caveats and quirks. For example, Jackson is fine if you want to serialise bean style classes into JSON, but I never use bean classes so I instead want field-based serialisation. Trying to get Jackson to do this is a headache - if you can get it to work you may find your classes are now smothered in Jackson annotations.

I usually start with Jackson, give up and switch to Gson, then give up on that as well due to some other quirk. Then I bastardise my types so the serialisation framework likes them and ring-fence them so as to never use them for anything else. Then I have to write converters between the interal types and the serialised types, and I realise that it would have been easier to just hand-code the internal types into JSON. The entire experience is enervating.

I think the fundamental issues are Java's type system - it's not very algebraic in nature and has various quirks and inconsistencies that make round-tripping data via a serialised format quite tricky. Also, there's the fact that it's very difficult to deserialise data back into its original class - what if it doesn't have any empty ctor because all of it's fields are final, etc.

I hope that once we have Value Types, then the problem becomes several orders of magnitude more easy.

Also, avoid Java Serialisation, it's widely regarded as a mistake, and will eventually be deprecated and probably removed.",1537215422.0

A bunch of them and we've even built our own (with some very specific needs). The case for JSON serialisation is obvious I guess and I have also used Jackson to read config YAML files for example.

For some projects speed is important, for others it's size, and for again others backwards compatibility being built-in is.

skjolber,"We're using JUnit 5 to inject JWT tokens directly in our unit test methods, based on parameter annotations, calling on the local web instance under test (in Spring). This involves pointing the verifier to the public key on a localhost wiremock instance. The verifier parses the JWT to concrete objects (i.e. the interesting parts of the token) and injects them in the target REST controller method as a method parameter. It is beautiful and easy to use.

&#x200B;

Writing libraries for testing is very underrated, I am never as cost-effective as when I create proper test libraries like the above.

&#x200B;

Unit-testing remote services is not that simple in the start, what you'd like is to point your services to localhost and then mock the services using some test tool which delegate to a Mockito instance which is available in the unit test method. Some frameworks can shortcut or assist in the above, your milage will depend on the actual HTTP client in your application. In general you'll go along way with Wiremock for REST services, SOAP is a little worse - I've written a [test tool](https://github.com/skjolber/mockito-soap-cxf) you might try out. Basically unit-testing 'integration-test style'. 

&#x200B;

Everything can and should be tested, but depending on your measurement more than 90% coverage will start to be quite cubersome. Also use tools like findbugs and so - there is more to code quality than code coverage.

i_post_things,"I never really thought about it much myself, but it does make sense from a re-use perspective.  If you don't create a completely new object build(), the other methods would have side effects if you build multiple objects.


Eg:

    SomeBuilder b;
    b.setUrl(x);
    b.setPort(y);
    HttpConnector c = b.build();
    
    b.setPort(n);
    HttpConnector d = b.build();
    
    // Expectation: c uses port y, d uses port n 
    // At this point, both c and d might be set to port n, 
    // if it was a reference to the same object.
    
----

Spring takes it to the extereme by creating a completely new builder every time an operation is called: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/web/client/RestTemplateBuilder.java


That's taking it to the extreme because it's not intuitive why something like this wont work when you spit it up over multiple lines:

    RestTemplateBuilder b;
    b.setUrl(x);
    b.setPort(y);
    b.setProxy(p);
    
    // b now only has the proxy P set because 
    // each call created a new builder.

Eg, it is supposed to work like:

    b.setUrl(x)
    .setPort(y)
    .setProxy(p).build();

Or 

    b = b.setUrl(x)
    b = b..setPort(y)
    b = b..setProxy(p);",1537022467.0
imps-p0155,"For me it does not makes sense to have the builder for `Font`.

1. The Builder always returns the same object (like in the linked example)

BillyKorando,"Wanted to pass along here on r/Java about the excellently named LavaOneConf. 

LavaOne as suggested in the tweet is looking to model itself after [JCrete](http://www.jcrete.org). I spoke at LavaOne last year and it was an amazing time, attendance was a little on the... low side, but there were A LOT of great speakers/presentations as well as can be seen here: https://twitter.com/java/status/955826709198073856?s=21

To my knowledge the plan is again to hold the conference on the north shore of Oahu (island where Honolulu is located), which offers a much more initiate setting. I say this because it’s going to give you a real opportunity to connect with some of the best Java speakers on the planet. Not being negative about the really big conferences, but when there are thousands of attendees the amount of face to face time an attendee can have with a speaker can be limited. It can also be overwhelming for speakers if dozens, hundreds, of people want to talk to you. LavaOne can be an opportunity to have real conversations with speakers and other attendees in amich more relaxed setting. 

Planning is still underway, but looks likely that there will be another great line up of speakers again this year. So while on its face it might seem hard to justify attending a conference in Hawaii, the real opportunity to learn and connect might make it more practical. Also tickets are typically cheaper, so the comparative cost to other conferences might not be as extreme as it might initially seem.",1536936910.0

The trivial part is key here. There will always be bells and whistles you can tag into such a project to practice newfound skills. Hell, large companies seem to follow that strategy too.

Average people might tell you about language things like streams, above average people often tell you more general things like learning about when to build from scratch and when to use 3rd party)

Ask about the innate problems of microservices and see whether they understand that if you are not careful you are getting the classic issues of distributed systems and assumptions about sequential execution don't hold any more. How did they previously solve it? What was good or bad about these approaches? Anything they learned while failing with a previous approach?

Ok. These are only three themes but they allow you to talk in depth about their previous experience and see how they think. Also it is almost impossible to create canned responses for such interview fragments.",1536785742.0
uniVocity,"I suggest the following to find the better suited candidates:

 * give them code and ask them to point out what problems they see and how they would improve it

 * ask them to build unit tests and make changes to that existing code.

 * ask them to refactor the code for readability, then performance.

 * observe how the person reacts to all this: how he tackles the issues, debugs and tests everything.

It's never an exact science, but in my experience this is most helpful to find the people who will fit better into your team.

Asking about past projects and stuff doesn't really help to weed out candidates as there are many devs out there who happened to stay employed for long enough to mention a given project in their resume, but were a liability most of the time. Put candidates in front of code and let them work with it. Give them pre-existing code to play with instead ONLY random problems to be implemented from scratch.

If you rely on talking only you may end up wasting time with people who are professional bullshitters: they make up stories but have lots of confidence and you'd be impressed by smoke and mirrors. Eventually they may give  incorrect answers (very off base) so you find them out - but they sound so confident you almost end up questioning yourself.
",1536826432.0
NoLemurs,"A lot of the answers here seem to be suggesting mostly very open-ended questions. I think that's a terrible idea. Open ended questions select for people who are good at talking about themselves under pressure. That's a useful skill to be sure, and you can certainly rule out some candidates based on their being terrible communicators, but most of your candidates will likely be barely able to code their way out of a wet paper bag, and the 'good at talking' axis is almost orthogonal to the 'good at programming' axis.

For a junior position, the single most important thing is to have the candidate do some actual coding. It doesn't need to be a tricky problem - choose something that any semi-competent programmer should be able to do, but with enough complexity that they'll have to make some decisions. Do they make good decisions? If you point out problems their decisions imply, do they adapt the solution effectively?

For a more senior candidate, some sort of design problem is really the way to go. Pick some moderately complicated system that you're familiar with, and have them talk through their approach to solving the problems that system solves. Otherwise it's a lot like the junior candidate question: do they make good decisions? When you point out shortcomings in their decisions do they adapt effectively?

You want to hire people who make good decisions. But everyone makes mistakes, especially in a stressful interview. What you want most of all is people who will quickly pick up on their mistakes when they're pointed out, and correct effectively.

If a candidate just makes good decisions, that's fine too, but honestly, you learn more when they do make mistakes, so ideally you calibrate your question so that at least some minor mistakes happen for a good candidate.",1536806204.0

cogman10,"I honestly think the best way to understand and make SQL faster is to just know what it is doing.

Primary key/Clustered Index.  Stores the rows in sorted order based on the columns in the key/index.  That is to say, if you do a clustered index on a, b, c.  Then it will sort first by a, then by b, then by c.

Nonclustered indexes/regular indexes are that, only with the clustered index tacked on.  So a nonclustered index of d, e, f would be sorted by d, then e, then f and the data stored in it will be a, b, c.

Now, if I want to get something out of the above table, will that be fast?  Answer, probably no (depending on how many values a and b have)  because you have to go through ever a and b to match on the c.

If I want it by d, how fast will it be? Very fast, because that is the first column in the clustered index.

If I want it by a, how fast?  The fastest, because a is the first column on the clustered index.  It has to do almost no seeks to find it.

&#x200B;

Knowing this information, it should be pretty easy to deduce what will be fast and what will be slow.  It will also help you to shape your indexes and figure out what to avoid (for example, a clustered index on a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, might be bad because all your non-clustered indexes need to store that information).

The tips on ""don't use wild cards"" and ""don't use functions"" because if you thought about ""how would I do that?"" it becomes pretty clear quickly that there aren't good solutions to do those fast.

As for the tips on ""Don't mix order"" and ""don't use different column types""... well, honestly I just disagree with those as tips.  Those are things that the SQL optimizer can certainly optimize away, even if your indexes are ordered differently from the select order.

However, all that being said, sorting in the db is probably a bad idea anyways, especially sorting on non-indexed columns.  Why?  Because how would you do that as a programmer?  Well, first you have to get all of the items into memory, then you need to start sorting them one by one.  If you rely on the index ordering, that is basically free because sort order is a property of the index.  However, any unindexed thing will need separate sorting, which you might as well do in application space.",1536708166.0

2. You'd have to check their licensing stuff, but something like $25 per CPU per month IIRC. That's for the OracleJDK version, if you use the Oracle OpenJDK version, it's free.
3. It's the exact same code (or nearly so, and will soon be). The differences are in how it's supported. You can't call Oracle for help when you're using the OpenJDK. The OracleJDK will also receive security updates and such for longer.

CoolCamera,"Java and C are different in many ways, C does not know the concept of objects. C is in fact functional/procedural language. However, learning C will help you learning C++ which is, somehow, more similar to Java.

Java can do pretty much anything you need to do. Tasks that cannot be completed using the standard Java, can usually be accomplished using technologies such as JNI or NDK

You do not have to learn JavaScript unless you want to write JavaScript code. By the way, Java and JavaScript are completely different things

&#x200B;",1536554522.0
Droid2Win,"Ok, so here are some answers. I should point out I'm a professional Java developer, but I haven't really worked with C very much.

&#x200B;

Java is one of the most widely used programming languages out there. It generally ties with C in terms of the widest usage in actual professional software deployments. It is primarily used for server-side applications.

&#x200B;

Because it is so widely used, there is a LOT of documentation on the subject. There are books like Essential Java and Java Concurrency in Practice that are excellent. Even older Java books, which may not have the newer features in them, are still excellent because the fundamentals of the language are still the same. There are also many courses online, both free and paid, that you can take to learn it as well.

&#x200B;

As for Java vs C, they are more different than similar. The similarities are mostly syntax-related, because Java's syntax was specifically modeled after C's. The differences are everything else. Java applications run in a very different way from C applications, so you're going to want to focus on the fundamentals of Java if you're getting started.

&#x200B;

As for using it like C, the answer is ""kind of"". You can certainly build similar applications, but the actual way of building them will be very different. Again, Java is not C, you have to build applications the Java way, but the types of applications you can build can be similar.

&#x200B;

As for scripting, in general Java cannot be used for scripting. Java 9 includes JShell, which does provide some scripting abilities, but Java is not intended to be a scripting language.

&#x200B;

JavaScript, despite the similarity of the name, has nothing to do with Java. JavaScript is a completely different language that only has the name that it does because Netscape wanted to capitalize on Java's popularity for marketing. If you're learning Java, ignore JavaScript entirely, they have nothing to do with each other.

&#x200B;

Java is what I would call a general-purpose language. It can do almost everything any language can do. That being said, there are strengths and weaknesses to every language. Java is better with headless (meaning no UI) applications, that run server side. It's better when you don't need fine-grained memory management, since all of Java's memory management is handled by its built in Garbage Collector. It's better when you need large enterprise level applications rather than small, quick little apps.

You can use it like C in the contexts above, however there are some lower level things like drivers, real time computing, even OS and kernel stuff that aren't as suitable for Java.

I also read through some other posts, and also read the post where you [crafted a policy file by hand][1].

I happen to notice that [Spring uses cglib][2].  
cglib is a unsafe library to use in a sandboxed environment.

One of the problems here is [`net.sf.cglib.core.ReflectUtils`][3], here with it's worst offender:

    public static Class defineClass(String className, byte[] b, ClassLoader loader, ProtectionDomain protectionDomain)

This allows anyone to load any class at runtime with any permission.

Also worth mentioning is the [cglib wiki][4], where it is suggested that you simply give it `AllPermission`.

You can also specify `-Djava.java.security.debug=access,codebase=file://...` so you don't log any permissions that are not required by that codebase.

ForeverAlot,"This article is disingenuous. Half aren't real leaks and there isn't much in the way of explanation. It's semantics, but if you read this article and come away with ""this is how leaks happen"" then it's because you don't know what a leak really is and consequently have not learned how to avoid them.

2.1 is not a leak; you asked for a class variable and got one. There's a close variant of it that does cause leaks, however: a cache-like variable (usually a map) that is continually filled with objects at runtime without any transitive cleaning mechanism. That one is insidious because, given how many frameworks, including Spring, work, the cache variable may not need to be static: it is enough for it to exist in a permanently allocated bean. Java has `WeakReference` and `PhantomReference` for problems like that, although if you specifically need a cache just use an off-the-shelf implementation.

2.3 actually _still_ [suffers from an obscure potential leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/97rqbt/best_and_worst_java_exception_handling/e4aocb5/); and 2.4 isn't ""similar"", it's ""the same"", only some resources are managed by the JVM and some aren't (now you're not just leaking JVM memory, you're also leaking sockets or file descriptors at the system level).

2.5 is not a leak either, although in this case it's only because the author fails to establish a uniqueness definition for `Key` (and then turns the problem on its head and spins it that way). Instead it's a correctness error: `Key` was supposed to be unique by `Key.key`, which requires fulfilling certain contracts (`equals()`, and ideally `hashCode()`) that `Key` does not fulfil. Conversely, by not fulfilling those contracts, `Key` reverts to the default uniqueness definition which is correct but potentially inefficienct. In other words, adding objects with default `equals()` and `hashCode()` to a set does not inherently leak memory, but may cause you to spend more than strictly necessary. Again, there is a variant of this example that _will_ cause leaks, though it's still about correctness: calling `map.remove(new Key(""key""))` will not remove anything because the argument is a new unique object that doesn't exist in the map.",1536389192.0

chambolle,"A good example of memory leak is the following one.

Suppose, you write a kind of stack of objects. The stack is represented by an array of your objects for instance:

 `MyObjects arr[];`

Then a position index is used: `int pos`

Now when you push an element the code looks like:

`arr[pos++]=myobj;`

and when you pop an element it looks like:

`pos--;`

In this case, you can have a memory leak, because arr\[pos+1\] continues to refer to your object, so it is not possible to reclaim its memory. It is subtil and difficult to see in code.

The right code of pop becomes

`arr[pos]=null; pos--;`

Now the memory of the previous value of arr\[pos+1\] can be reclaimed, because there is no more reference to it",1536740099.0

It was set up as a peer programming exercise and they could use whatever resources they wanted. They had an hour for the test.

I liked this assessment because I had to constantly tell and discuss my findings with the interviewers. I could ask questions if I were stuck somewhere and there was no countdown timer ticking (the project was big enough and ""open"").

I think this assessment shows the interviewers much about how the interviewee approaches a problem, how he communicates, how he works in a team and his analyzing / design skills.

At an other place I had an assignment to solve in an hour. It was a simple CRUD application in general, but the sceleton was written in a language I had only used rarely, I was not familiar with the IDE and the libraries.

It has scope for additional features and allows us to probe at face to face interview, things such as rationale for how they reached design decisions, why they implemented feature X over Y, how they’d add feature Z if that was then thrown in as a requirement. 

Before the interview we have a few members of the team provide feedback on a PR for it (internally viewable only) and we then have a good basis for an in-depth discussion at the interview.

JakeWharton,"> There is one irregular restriction on lazy finals: They must never be initialized to their default value. Thus, a lazy field of reference type must not be assigned a null value by its initializer, and an integral type must not be assigned zero. A lazy boolean can only be assigned a single value, true, since false is its default value. If a lazy static field's initializer returns the default value, the linkage of the field will fail with an appropriate linkage error.

Dart does *not* have that restriction, though. Instead, an implementation is expected to store an additional ""was initialized"" bit somewhere, if that can't be optimized away.

It's a pretty high cognitive barrier to require users to remember that the default value is now a forbidden value if you use `lazy`.",1536067691.0

pushupsam,"It's an interesting idea. I  It would make more sense to perhaps implement this as a plugin for h2 (http://www.h2database.com/). h2 is already a very popular, fully-featured rdbms. There's no need to reinvent the wheel here. H2 already has the ability to write Triggers as Java interfaces (http://www.h2database.com/html/features.html#triggers) which let you do complex consistency checks in Java.

What would be interesting here would be to modularize the project into (1) a language for expressing complex consistency checks and a parser (2) a Java model created by the parser (3) an engine for evaluating such checks in the h2-database.

walen,"This article is really lacking. I wonder why would Java's official (?) Twitter account even consider promoting it.

It just copies the interfaces' source code with barely any explanation, e.g.:

> 3.3 Supplier  
Represents a supplier of results.  

Woah.

And then adds a single ""example"" for each interface, but they are really, reeeally simple, just `println()`s and calls to `apply()`/`accept()` -- and it doesn't even show the output:

    Consumer<Person> consumer = (person) -> {
            System.out.println(person.getName());
            System.out.println(person.getAge());
    };
    consumer.accept(new Person(""Ramesh"", 30));

No examples of how to pass them as parameters to other methods, or how to use them with `Streams`, or any Real World™ example of how to use them, or why.

So, the topic is really interesting but the article is not really useful at all in its current state, sorry.

PS: Also, the `BiConsumer` example is a duplicate of the `BiFunction` example (probably just a copy-paste issue), so it's actually missing the example for `BiConsumer`.",1535986220.0

I like the modularity of Spring Boot, whereas I don't see any need to include something like Guava or Apache Http Client or JodaTime in the framework. Especially JodaTime has been superseded by the (not so) new Java Time API. Is it really so hard to include a dependency in the pom.xml? What makes a framework like Dropwizard useful (one could call it meta framework) is the wiring, but to wire something like Guava is simply not necessary.

Spring Boot has a lot more to offer and you can plug extensions in or replace things like Logback with (the faster) Log4j and the limited slf4j API with Log4j API. Another major difference I see is the support for reactive programming, where Spring really shines. WebFlux is a joy to use, whereas async programming with JAX-RS is a PITA.

Ideally that's IMO done in two separate image layers (one rather stable with the (JDK) dependence modules which you'll only need to rebuild and distribute if your dependences change, and another one just with your application module). That way your image will be smaller overall, while still having to rebuild only those layers actually needed.

I would recommend you to develop a spring rest-api that can handle all CRUD operations (spring web module). Then when you are familiar with js you can create a html, css and js frontend. Then bind the springboot service to the js frontend. Use JSON for sending data between frontend and backend. Multithreading for such a simple app is way out of scope. As database just use a simple inmemory database like h2. Yes its a client-server application. Make sure to use the spring tomcat module so you dont need to setup an applicationserver.

pgris,"**vavr** is incredible powerful, but has hard learning curve. Authors try to implement lots of functional constructs, with great success, but the price is you need to step out of the java libraries and normal way of doing things and it may confuse some people: A vavr List is not a java List, a vavr Option is not a Java Optional, pattern matching requires an annotation processor and looks kind of a hack. Don't get me wrong, is awesome, but if that's your cup of tea you might as well use Scala.

**jool** is a thin wrapper over java Stream that makes it way more useful, several implementation of Tuples and Function, a wrapper for handling IOException inside streams and that's pretty much it. I love it and use it in most my projects. It does not change your life, but makes your code clearer and more concise.

**functionaljava** I don know anything about, never used it.

 * use jool for a happier java experience
 * use vavr if you want to program in scala and your boss don't let you

,"If we're just talking about a single web server, then it is possible to just embed [Jetty](https://www.baeldung.com/jetty-embedded) in your application. With Jetty you can configure layers of [filters](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.4.x/cross-origin-filter.html), [handlers](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.4.x/resource-handler.html), [servlets](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.4.x/proxy-servlet.html) and even [jersey resources](https://nikgrozev.com/2014/10/16/rest-with-embedded-jetty-and-jersey-in-a-single-jar-step-by-step/). I think [this](https://github.com/terminological/jetty-jersey-swagger) is a great Jetty-Jersery-Swagger example. It shows how to host the Swagger documentation endpoint for your Jersey jax-rs endpoints (the Swagger documentation is generated for viewing with the swagger-ui, but not saved in a file by default).

The Jetty-Jersey-Swagger setup is powerful and relatively simple for a single web server, but it isn't quite a full micro service solution. The Java micro services that I maintain are made up of some web servers, some processing nodes and some storage nodes. Jetty supports a [distributed](https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/enterprise-java/jetty/jetty-session-clustering-example/) setup, so you could have a pretty highly available gateway to your micro service cluster. From there you could have a bunch of distributed storage/processing nodes that are built off of [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/) and [Hazelcast Jet](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet) or [Apache Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/). There may also be a need for high-speed messaging between the nodes in your micro service cluster and that can be handled by [JMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Message_Service) [libraries](http://activemq.apache.org/) or an RPC library like [Apache Thrift](https://github.com/apache/thrift).",1536306259.0
nutrecht,"Last few projects I've been on we've been building our microservices with Spring Boot. IMHO the downside of most of the micro-frameworks is that you basically end up assembling your own version of something like Spring because all the typical requirements are still there (logging, security, metrics, tracing, health endpoints, data access) and you don't want to re-build that for every service.

Gilgamesjh,"Spring Boot with Webflux and Kotlin and manual bean wiring is pretty lean, however last time I checked, the Swagger Spring Boot stuff was hardwired with a dependency to Spring MVC (wich is not really compatible with Webflux).

If I get to choose, (and sometimes I do), I would use Vert.x with Kotlin. 

While I agree full support for Swagger would be nice, it seems it is not really that well implemented in Java for some reason. I would choose the framework that best support my use case (and developer knowledge), and get swagger from somewhere else, for example stoplight.io

Recognizing the impact that the release cycle changes will have with Java developers, IBM will partner with other members of the OpenJDK community to continue to update an OpenJDK Java 8 stream with security patches and critical bug fixes.  We intend to keep the current LTS version secure and high quality for 4 years. This timescale bridges the gap between LTS versions with 1 year to allow for a migration period.  IBM has also invested in an open build and test project (AdoptOpenJDK.net) along with many partners and Java leaders to provide community binaries across commonly used platforms of OpenJDK with Hotspot and OpenJDK with Eclipse OpenJ9.  These community binaries are TCK (Java SE specification) compliance tested and ready for developers to download and use in production.",1535463458.0

Right now I'm stuck with 1.7 because of an old weblogic version but I dont want to run a jdk that isnt getting security patches/updates, right?",1535513982.0
speakjava,"Unfortunately, the suggestion of staying on JDK 8 and building the OpenJDK yourself misses a rather important point: who backports the security and bug fixes? When JDK 8 public updates end next January, the fixes will only be in the current repo, i.e. JDK 11, 12, etc. The code bases are diverging (especially with the introduction of JPMS in JDK 9) so it's not always as simple as applying a webrev. Also, where do security/bug fixes come for features that are deleted? For example, [java.se.ee](https://java.se.ee) is removed in JDK 11 so no more updates to that in a public repo.  


The same applies to AdoptOpenJDK, they have said they will not be backporting fixes themselves but relying on someone else to do it.  Who that is, is not clear yet.",1535443141.0
pron98,"One important thing missing from this discussion is what JDK versions *mean*. An early suggestion for a new versioning scheme based on `year.month` was rejected, and new JDK versions just bump the number, starting with 10. So they *look* the same as before, but new JDK version numbers don't *mean* the same thing as they did before. 

Most importantly, the new release strategy does away with major Java releases altogether. Java 9 was the *last major Java version* for the foreseeable future, and Java users should not consider upgrading, say, 10->11 or 11->12 to be the same as going 7->8 or 8->9. In order to make upgrades easier and to do away with major versions, we had to remove the restriction on what can change in the 6 month releases we (Oracle and the rest of the OpenJDK community) were doing anyway. Upgrading from 11->12 should be somewhere between upgrading 7->8 and between 8->8u20 -- hopefully closer to the latter. Treating new JDK versions starting with 10 as if they are major versions is a mistake.

So ""staying on 11"" means something very different from ""staying on 8"" because 8 was a major version; 11 won't be (and neither would 12, 13, etc.). ""Staying on 8"" therefore means staying on the last major Java version before 9; ""staying on 11"" means staying on some feature release *arbitrarily* designated LTS (which you may have valid reasons to do, but it doesn't mean the same thing).",1535469451.0

Goofybud16,"Probably an unpopular opinion here, but I don't like JavaFX. I find it pretty terrible to work with after working with Swing.

Let's start with Layout Managers: In Swing, you have one singular JPanel. You can extend this, and add features, and have a swap-in panel after writing one class. We do this at work to add some debug info to make life much easier: We have a <company>JPanel which adds a few things we almost always use. Since the layout is handled by the layout manager (set on the panel), this works fine. In JavaFX, every layout is a new panel. Even better, they all have a slightly different API! That is just ridiculous.

The tables have ObservableValues, which can easily cause memory leaks.

As far as I've seen, there is no trivial way to add-in custom drawing code. If I want to write a custom border around a component in Swing, I just implement Border, implement 3 methods (2 of which are trivial) and I have a custom border. I need to draw a custom graphic? Extend JPanel, override the paintComponent(...) method, draw my stuff.

Want to custom color a single component? Just setForeground/setBackground and off you go. Due to the CSS in JavaFX, this was a PITA last time I tried to do it. Sure, the CSS makes it a little easier to style everything than a Swing L&F, but as soon as you want to change the coloring on just one single button, it makes life way harder than it is on Swing.

I feel like all that JavaFX gets you over Swing is animation (which I  personally don't care about at all) and a different L&F, but you could recreate that in Swing if it was really that big of a deal. The IntelliJ L&Fs actually look pretty good, I'd probably rip those out since they are Apache2. JavaFX feels like someone looked at a few pitfalls in Swing (animation is hard, etc), then said ""Imma make a new UI toolkit that avoids all of those pitfalls!"" then proceeded to fall into all of the ones that Swing avoided.

Plus there is no equivalent to GridBagConstraints, so that right there eliminates it as a good UI toolkit. ^(Semi /s on the GBC point)",1535212563.0

parms,"Very nice guide. My one issue is that you put a lot of emphasis on the difficulty of writing raw JDBC code, in particular with regard to resource cleanup. In any Java project started today (with the exception of Android projects) the proper idiom is to use try-with-resources which almost entirely solves this problem.

`insertWithJDBCSafely()` becomes:
        
    public void insertWithJDBCSafely() {
      User user = new User();
      try (Connection cxn = DriverManager.getConnection(""jdbc:mysql://localhost/test"");
          PreparedStatement stmt = cxn.prepareStatement(""insert into users (first_name, last_name) values (?,?)"")) {
        try {
          cxn.setAutoCommit(false); // starts a new database transaction
          stmt.setString(1, user.getFirstName());
          stmt.setString(2, user.getLastName());
          stmt.executeUpdate();
          cxn.commit(); // commits the database transaction
        } catch (SQLException e) {
          // TODO do some application error handling here
          try {
            cxn.rollback();
          } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // nothing you can really do here, apart from logging the error
          }
        }
      }
    }

Moreover I use a utility function `withinTransaction()` that takes care of the repeated logic that will appear throughout the application:

    public interface CheckedRunnable<E extends Throwable> {
      void run() throws E;
    }

    public static <E extends Throwable> void withinTransaction(Connection cxn, CheckedRunnable<E> task) throws SQLException, E {
      checkNotNull(cxn, ""Connection cannot be null"");
      checkNotNull(task, ""Task cannot be null"");
      cxn.setAutoCommit(false);
      try {
        task.run();
        cxn.commit();
      } catch (Throwable t) {
        try {
          cxn.rollback();
        } catch (Throwable t) {
          log.error(""Unable to roll back transaction"", t);
        }
        throw t;
      } finally {
        cxn.setAutoCommit(true);
      }
    }

Which simplifies the first method even further in Java 8+:

    public void insertWithJDBCSafely() {
      User user = new User();
      try (Connection cxn = DriverManager.getConnection(""jdbc:mysql://localhost/test"");
          PreparedStatement stmt = cxn.prepareStatement(""insert into users (first_name, last_name) values (?,?)"")) {
        withinTransaction(cxn, () -> {
          stmt.setString(1, user.getFirstName());
          stmt.setString(2, user.getLastName());
          stmt.executeUpdate();
        });
      }
    }

A similar idiom can be used to return a result using a `CheckedSupplier<T, E extends Throwable>`.

If you have the misfortune of being on Android or Java 6 or below, you can use Guava's [Closer](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/25.1-jre/api/docs/com/google/common/io/Closer.html) to achieve code almost as clean with regard to resource management.",1535118680.0
lukaseder,"The difficulty with tutorials ([and apparently, it is my own fault in this case 🙈](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/99wdbo/a_guide_to_accessing_databases_in_java/e4r2hu6)) is that they make very simple examples like these:

```
// Fetch all users
for (UserRecord user : create.fetch(USERS)) {
    // Check if user has more than five active subscriptions
    // (yes, that doesn't make sense - but you will likely remember it more)
    if (user.fetchChildren(Keys.FK_SUBSCRIPTION_USER_ID).size() > 5) {
        user.setHero(true);
        user.store();
    }
}
```

This looks kind of reasonable and in a more complex setup, it might be how someone uses jOOQ indeed. But this particular example is very wrong as it produces tons of queries from the client, which can all be replaced by a single bulk update.

In SQL:

```
UPDATE users
SET hero = true
WHERE 5 < (
  SELECT count(*) 
  FROM subscription s
  WHERE s.user_id = users.user_id
)
```

With jOOQ

```
create.update(USERS)
      .set(USERS.HERO, true)
      .where(inline(5).lt(
            selectCount()
            .from(SUBSCRIPTION)
            .where(SUBSCRIPTION.USER_ID.eq(USERS.USER_ID))))
      .execute();
```

Some DBs support joins in UPDATE statements, which may be even faster than the above correlated subquery version (jOOQ would also support that), but both versions will quite likely outperform the ""CRUD"" example, where we get 1-2 database round trips *per user*",1535117145.0

dpash,"Everything. Lambdas has been a massive shift in the style you write Java.  Streams allow you to write operations on collections in a very step-by-step manner. 

        StringJoiner joiner = new StringJoiner(""\"",\"""", ""\"""", ""\"""");
        for (ReportColumn reportColumn : report.getColumnNames()) {
            String id = reportColumn.getId();
            if (id != null) {
                joiner.add(id);
            }
        }
        String headers = joiner.toString();

becomes

        String headers = report.getColumnNames().stream()
                .map(ReportColumn::getId)
                .filter(Objects::nonNull)
                .collect(joining(""\"",\"""", ""\"""", ""\""""));

It's become much easier to use callback methods. For example, handling missing elements in maps is much less verbose

    Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
    ...
    if (map.get(key) == null) {
        String newValue = mappingFunction(key);
        if (newValue != null) {
            map.put(key, newValue);
        }
    }
    return map.get(key);

becomes

    Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
    ...
    return map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> mappingFunction(k));

(code is for demonstration only)

At the same time, things haven't changed all that much. Maven is still around, although Gradle is very common too. Spring is still king, but there's EE, Play, Vert.x etc. 

Development in spring and EE has gotten simpler. Much less XML, more annotations or just plain Java.

# What's new?

A very non-exhaustive assortment of changes:

Language:

* Lambdas
* Streams
* Local variable type inference (A.K.A. ""var"")
* Generic type inference
* Try-with-resources
* `default` and `private` methods in interfaces
* Functional interfaces
* Method references

Platform: 

* Modules/Jigsaw
* JavaFX - a new GUI library (now shipped separately from the JDK). Worth mentioning its `base` module is not only for GUI, it contains bindings and built-in observers for everyday use.
* OpenJDK (collaborate on Java libraries) and a lot of stuff was made open source (was commercial).
* New garbage collectors
* New Date-Time API
* New immutable/unmodifiable collections API
* New I/O API
* Fork/Join
* Invoke dynamic

Ecosystem:

* Containers (mostly Docker) have become the new thing (for now).
* Serverless functions
* Java on Android and iOS

And *a lot* is planned for the future:

* Value types and generics over primitives (project Valhalla)
* Replacement for JNI (project Panama)
* Fibers (project Loom)
* Pattern matching, switch expressions, raw string literals (project Amber)",1535412649.0

,"Remember that generics didn't exist until Java 1.5. When they were designing the feature, I'm sure forwards and backwards compatibility was a concern. Perhaps they chose a simpler syntax with easier rules (plus an existing token rather than a new one) to make the transition smoother for users / IDE maintainers.

Personally if I were designing the language from scratch I'd invent a new keyword (`inherits`? `isa`?) since both `extends` and `implements` are really more implementation details rather than a hierarchy descriptor.

Lyzonee,"Ups:

* You can tell what the code is trying to say. With Java, you know what you pass into a function, but with python, you just know the variable name.
* With Java, there's a lot of imports and things to do before you can interact with someone else's code. With Python, you can just ""import x"" and have it ready, but that's not always the case. 

Downs:
* Takes a while to make your point. Example:

public int add(int num1, int num2) {
	return num1+num2;
}

def add(num1, num2):
	return num1+num2

You don't know programming yet, so what I'm saying might not make sense, but which one looks shorter? The second one. That's python. The example might not be prime, but it gets the point across, with Java, you have to be very specific.

I'm a ""beginner"" myself, I've only been coding in Java for a few months, but I know enough to tell you that it's a good starting language. Lots of universities start with it, so it's not a bad choice at all. A language is just a tool, once you learn the concepts of programming, you can apply your knowledge to any language. I recommend sticking with one language while learning, then choose a field, e.g. game development or machine learning, and make your choice from there. If you need any specific help/beginner talk, PM me, I was in your position once and have lots of free time to help, we can talk on discord. Good luck.

Tayacan,"I'd recommend Python over Java to start with, if only because Python allows you to program without classes and objects in the beginning. In Java, you either have to figure out classes right away, or you have some code that you just sort of have to ignore until you get to those topics.

Also, Python is a lot easier to get up and running, the code will be shorter, and it has a good repl (even better if you install ipython).

The only place where Java beats Python as a learning language is the type system, but it's not that big of a deal until your programs start getting bigger and more complex (and I say this as someone who loves strong static type systems).

In the end, though, learning your second language is much easier than your first, and Java and Python share many concepts. Learn one, and you'll be able to pick up the other. ",1534926019.0

The down side is java 9 had some big changes.. and then 10 and 11 are adding on to it. I actually like the idea.. but the problem is.. too many people are still on jdk 6 or 7. We didnt move to 8 until it was EOL and 9 was already out with 10 about to release. Every 6 months new releases. The best bet is move to JDK 11.. its a LTS version.. means it will be supported for 3 years. If you move every 3rd release you are on an LTS.. so figure on every year and a half or so moving to the LTS version once you move to 11.  At this point, you are seriously best to just move to 11... which WILL cause some migration issues depending on what you are using.

I think the bigger problem is the huge 3rd party libraries that are not moving nearly as fast. You are going to find a lot of libraries no longer supported or taking a very long time to catch up depending on the number of developers working on them... many libraries have had developers move on to some of these new languages.. or so busy they cant update their libraries.

The example given in the article could have been written to produce the mapping/media type combinations from a method source for a parameterized test just as easily.

I like the idea of DynamicTest, but the question at the end of the day is what capabilities they give you over parameterized tests? I was hoping they would tie in at a lower level so that you could use include/exclude filters –for example– to run them. But, they're put together after filtering is done (see [this GH issue](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1178)). So, you can include a source line identifier now, but that doesn't seem to help in the given example.

-very basic platformer game

heliologue,"""Portlet"" in this context isn't language-agnostic; it's a very specific Java spec (well, two: JSR-168 and 268). It's possible other languages may have their own version, but ten years ago, if you were writing a ""Portlet"", you were writing it in Java.

Then too, Java was really the only serious enterprise-y language for web applications in 2003. PHP was just starting to explode with WordPress and Drupal, but nobody was doing serious large-scale stuff with anything else; Facebook was just starting to expand, RoR wasn't around yet, V8 and Node were a twinkle in somebody's eye, and even if they weren't, the sort of institutions deploying web portals weren't going to waste time on shiny hipster languages/frameworks yet.

utmalbarney,What I like about this series of articles is the detailed examples of places to use the patterns. That's what I find missing in most pattern tutorials.,1534446159.0
aenigmaclamo,"I think that this design pattern is useful for when your state is simple but your actions are complex since you'd need to create a new implementation of State for every type of possible State.

Rather, what I've found is that State tends to be complex but actions tend to be simpler. For that, the Model-View-Update or the Elm Architecture, used by Redux can be more useful. A Java style one might look like:

    enum ActionType {ADD, SUB, ADD_CHILD, SUB_CHILD, OTHER}
    class Action { public ActionType type; public int argument; }
    interface State<E extends State> { E update(Action action); }
    
    class ParentState implements State<ParentState> {
        final int i;
        final ChildState child;
    
        public ParentState(int i, ChildState child) {
            this.i = i;
            this.child = child;
        }
    
        @Override
        public ParentState update(Action action) {
            switch (action.type) {
                case ADD:
                    return new ParentState(this.i + action.argument, this.child);
                case SUB:
                    return new ParentState(this.i - action.argument, this.child);
            }
            return new ParentState(this.i, this.child.update(action));
        }
    
        static class ChildState implements State<ChildState>{
            private final int i;
    
            public ChildState(int i) {
                this.i = i;
            }
    
            @Override
            public ChildState update(Action action) {
                switch(action.type) {
                    case ADD_CHILD:
                        return new ChildState(this.i + action.argument);
                    case SUB_CHILD:
                        return new ChildState(this.i - action.argument);
                }
                return this;
            }
        }
    }

Essentially, you use objects which represent actions and use an update function which takes the prior state and the action to produce the new state. It also makes it easy to break up the state and dispatching work to other updaters.",1534462429.0
knaekce,"Does anyone actually use this?
I think this pattern is overkill for small state machines like in the example, but for real-world problems it does not scale because you end up with with too many methods which are mostly noops.

rzwitserloot,"Many notes for the author:

## 'use as goto':

If you want that kind of thing, this is MUCH simpler:

    public void jumpForwardExample() {
        label: {
            method1();
            if (condition) break label;
            method2();
        }
    }

The label is mandatory, but it works fine. This is only bad because 'goto is bad' if you consider _ALL_ break/continue statements bad, and that's a kind of fringe extremist style position that such a general blog post should not espouse. So, yes, it's bad to use exceptions for this because the above is simpler and more readable, but the blogpost is trying to paint this as bad because goto is bad, and that's completely erroneous. The 'goto considered harmful' main gist is that you shouldn't loop with them (you can't loop with this, therefore, not relevant), and that it results in spaghetti code (but you can't jump anywhere except out of lexical scope with this, so, not relevant). Thus, if you want to claim 'goto is bad so don't do this!' here, you have to do two things in addition: [1] Explain why, because the 'everybody knows why, just read Dijkstra' implicit argument simply does not apply here, or [2] Expand on how this means ALL use of break and continue is bad, or explain why somehow that isn't bad, because I don't see the difference.

## Catching throwable/exception is bad... no it isn't.

No.. it's good! At least, at the right times. Java software starts somewhere; an entry point. If you're writing a command line app, your entry point is usually `public static void main(String[] args)`. But if you're writing web stuff, you have a tonne of entry points: EVERY `doGet()` (servlet API) / EVERY method annotated with `@GET` (jersey etc) is an entry point.. and they should ALL just 'throw Exception'. They should do this, because the framework that starts your app/servlet/webhandler/whatever is definitely far better positioned to deal with unexpected exceptions than you can ever hope to be. That web framework can log the exception with LOTS of detail about the precise HTTP request that caused it, potentially ping via telegram or whatnot the platform owner if you feel like adding that kind of thing, and then render a nice error page to the user, possibly with a form submit to let the user give more detail about what they were doing. By putting it that way I hope it's clear that an 'unhandleable' exception (by which I mean: Your code has no feasible strategy to deal with the problem / the effort to deal with it is not worth it on a case by case basis) should DEFINITELY bubble allll the way up to the invoking framework. And if you want to do that, either you're rewrapping all your exceptions in ServletException, which is just a pointless waste of lines of codes, or.. you throw Exception.

Which leads to the obvious flip side of that: If you ARE writing an invoker framework and YOU are the one calling the entrypoint.. YOU catch Exception.

## It's exception populism!

You've highlighted a bunch of bad practices, but you haven't covered the solution. Pointing at bad things is all well and good but it's not very useful, and hard to put in context, if you don't also show some workable alternatives. I'll make a short list for your consideration:

* You MUST catch but have no idea what to do / are too lazy right now? Try this: `throw new RuntimeException(""Unhandled checked exception"", e);` – and, yes, you should update your IDE's templates to do this by default.
* In general when writing APIs, be generous with adding 'throws' clauses to interface methods.
* When writing APIs, include the concept of fallback. When using APIs, check if they have fallback mechanisms, and use them. For example, `map.get(""key"").toLowerCase()` may throw a nullpointerexception. But, `map.getOrDefault(""key"", """").toLowerCase()` won't. So, use that. Usually you're looking for a method where you pass in a lambda or default value, or where you configure before using the object what to do in exceptional cases.
* If you can throw, just throw. Your `public static void main` method should ALWAYS have `throws Exception` tossed onto it, for example. I see SO many newbies not do that and then write crappy exception handlers to try to handle unhandleable exceptions (usually by logging them or printing their stack trace or ignoring them).

## 'avoid exceptional conditions'.. not sure that's a good idea.

In the vein of the advice in this column, you'd prefer:

    if (map.containsKey(key)) map.get(key).doThingie();

but this is no good. You're wasting time (2 lookups where one would have been fine), and if this is a concurrent map, you've just introduced a REALLY hard to find (and therefore really pricey) bug; no amount of ConcurrentHashMap magic is going to guarantee you that this will never throw. The act of 'get the value associated with this key and act on it, but do nothing if it isn't in the map' should be 1 atomic operation, at least for the caller. Sometimes most practical way to make calls as atomic as they can be, is to rely on exceptions.
",1534432168.0
BillyKorando,"I enjoyed this article and I didn’t realize about the return/throw in a finally block would drop the initial exception. So thanks for that!

My only critique would be under best practices to add/mention, if you are going to perform the same behavior anyways in mutliple catch blocks, it’s fine to get rid of the more specific exceptions and only catch more generic.
    
    catch(FileNotFoundException e){
        LOG.error(e.getMessage(), e);
        throw new MyRuntimeException(e.getMessage());
    }catch(IOException e){
        LOG.error(e.getMessage(), e);
        throw new MyRuntimeException(e.getMessage());
    }

The first catch block should be squashed into the second one as it is just noise. I say this because I have seen this A LOT. 

Obviously this doesn’t apply if you are (or should be) doing something different between the separate catch blocks. ",1534433202.0
Sipkab,"Just a little bit of nitpicking that here you don't have to check for br != null in the finally block, as it can never happen:

    public String readFile(String path) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path));   
        try {
            return br.readLine();
        } finally {
            if(br != null) br.close();
        }
    }

If the allocation of the Reader fails, then the finally block is not executed, as the allocation is not in the try block.

One could be even more careful, if explicitly handles the FileReader closing, as the BufferedReader creation itself can throw an exception/error, while the FileReader remains unclosed.

    public String readFile(String path) throws IOException {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(path);
        try {
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);   
            try {
                return br.readLine();
            } finally {
                br.close();
            }
        } finally {
            fr.close();
        }
    }

This itself is a very edge case, but interesting to consider nonetheless. In this case close() is called twice on the FileReader instance (by BufferedReader as well), but thankfully the documentation states that calling close() for a second time has no effect.",1534424377.0

rzwitserloot,"2 separate reasons:

[1] It's not what I want, and
[2] Longevity of java.

# Longevity

Kotlin isn't the first 'java, but fixed'. It won't be the last. It has a long, looong line of pretenders to the throne. It's not just scala; there's Fan/Fantom, Groovy, and a great many others that all tried to be 'java, without the warts'.

They all came. And went. And more or less died.

Kotlin might very well be different; they usually do bring something new. Kotlin's chances seem better than most attempts, what with some backing from google and far more attention paid to IDE integration than the usual 'afterthought' status IDE integration gets.

I'll take the wait-and-see approach.

# it's not what I want

Let's travel back in time to CVS and SVN. When SVN came out, everyone jumped ship. I did not; SVN didn't feel worth it to me. I knew more or less what I wanted. Then git and hg showed up. Those DID have what I want, and I jumped early for those.

Kotlin feels like the SVN to java's CVS: Sure, it fixes some obvious issues, but I'm sure in time we'll discover warts (/u/hot2 's post linking to allegro.tech's from java to kotlin and back again already found a bunch), and switching language is a huge undertaking. So if I'm gonna jump ship I better get some value for the considerable investment.

Kotlin delivers more than most but not nearly enough.

I want a language which has an intrinsic notion of versioning, both for the language itself (all source files should start with the version of kotlin itself, and the compiler should not even HAVE a -source parameter; it gets that from the source files themselves), and for libraries (guava 25 should be able to have built into it the API of an earlier version and bridge code that knows what to do there, if you want, and when you work out what that might look like, some language support would go a long way).

I want a language where the most basic compilation unit and output is 'a project directory' and 'a jar file or equivalent'. Not 'source file' and 'class file'. Jigsaw and Maven/gradle should be one thing, and should be built into the language. It's time to lock it down.

I want a language where the language itself is pluggable; APIs have inside them code for IDEs to do lint checks, provide for interaction and code quality checks, and IDE conveniences. For example, regular expression APIs should ship with ways to test/check them, and ways to type them into the IDE such that backslash escaping is not an issue, regex groups are highlighted separately, and for example unmatched parens are instantly highlighted as an error.

That last one in particular is so disappointing: If anyone would design a language based on that concept, surely it'd be an IDE builder.

Note also that all these things should fit right into java-like syntax and java-like code style.

GuyWithLag,"A bit late to the party, but I'll add my 0.02 eurocents anyway.

First of all, some clarifications:

* Reactive streams do not have much overlap with the Observable pattern besides the name. They're more like a cross between Streams and CompletableFutures.
* The JDK 9 contains the necessary parts to enable *interoperability* between different reactive flow implementations. Yes, you can bridge between Spring Flow and RxJava Flowables and Vert.x and Akka. Implementing your own reactive streams on top that is a bit like implementing your own UI toolkit on top of AWT (when there's Swing or JavaFX around).
* Most reactive stream tutorials are focusing on the wrong abstraction layer - they focus on the primitive building blocks then run out of steam before they reach the more useful high-level parts. The video you linked does that too.

Now, I use reactive streams *a lot* on my day job, and it's usually in the context of REST API calls. Wait, what? What do reactive streams have to do with REST calls? Here's an example of RxJava + Retrofit:

    apiClient
    .getOrder(id)
    .flatMapIterable(Order::getLineItems)
    .flatMap(lineItem ->
        apiClient.getProduct(lineItem.getProductId())
                 .map(product -> product.getCurrentPrice() * lineItem.getCount()),
        5)
    .reduce((a,b)->a+b)
    .retryWhen((e, count) -> count<2 && (e instanceof RetrofitError))
    .onErrorReturn(e -> -1)
    .subscribe(System.out::println);

If you work with microservices, a lot of information will be distributed across different services and when you need to collect it, all these HTTP calls will take too long to be executed sequentially. Enter RxJava and Retrofit; the latter has the option to return HTTP calls as reactive stream objects compatible with the former. As a result the above 11 lines pack a very significant punch:

* Parallel but contained - \`getOrder\` and \`getProduct\` can be configured to be on their own thread pools / Schedulers, so that there's a hard limit on the # of concurrent connections to a downstream service.
* Parallel but cooperating - the fan-out on the \`getProduct\` call is 5, no more - you will not saturate the connection pool with a single call. 
* Retryable - if an HTTP-related error happens, it will retry at most 2 times. (arguably this could be optimized, but this is an example)\\
* Safe on errors - it will always return a value, even if there's an error that happened.
* Safe on cancellation - I can dispose/cancel the subscription, and the reactive streams implementation will make sure that upstream operators/reactive streams will be properly unsubscribed from and that running operations (such as running HTTP calls) are properly aborted.

Granted, this is just an example and in actual use it does become a bit more complex, but the gist is true.

Another place where reactive streams are awesome are JMS message processing - properly configured backpressure will result in a system processing messages as fast as possible but no faster, with a minimum of messages in flight.",1534109782.0

Also, I'd point out that collisions isn't the end all be all when it comes to hashes.  For what hashCode is used (Hashmaps/sets) Speed is far more important so a comparison of that would also be important.

But yeah, most strings are either going to be for giant blobs of text (xml, json, etc) or for single words (""CLIENT"", ""USER"", etc).

I doubt these strings are hardly ever random characters in the original blogs like ""%~"" or ""$#"".  That will only happen in cases of things like a session token or if you are doing something like compilation (you probably aren't).

Wouldn't it be a better show case if you take the Interface (IStack) as a variable, instantiate your Stack implementation before, define explained test cases (which are getting red) and afterwards you try to implement the class while getting green results? This would be a little less wordy.

For me it is not understandable why do you use hamcrest? With plain JUnit would be your show case understandable as well. Either you argue at the beginning of your post why hamcrest is very useful for TDD or you don't use it in the post.

The direction is good. You can explain the showcase very well but in my opinion you can assume that the reader has a little knowledge and just want to know what the new point is.",1533898663.0
koeberlue,"This is a very good example on how to get started with TDD. But there are some points you could improve in my opinion:

* There is no explanation how and when the `size()` method was implemented
* You seem to be using JUnit 4, while Junit 5 is already released
* Some tests are not named very well. e.g. `populatedStack()` does not tell me, what is really tested. If it was named  `populatedStackIsNotEmpty()` i would not need to read the source code to understand what this test is for. [Roy Osherove](http://artofunittesting.com/) proposes a naming scheme, which comes down to `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_Behavior()` so the test would be called `isEmpty_populatedStack_returnsFalse()`
* I found the tutorial hard to navigate. Maybe you could add some headings like *Getting Started*, *Method Push*, *Method Pop* and a table of contents
* It would be great if there was an option to download the finished source code to tinker with it. Maybe create a Maven project and upload it to Gitlab. Setting up a project with dependencies (like Hamcrest and JUnit) can be hard for beginners

Other than that I think you wrote a good tutorial which was very easy to follow.
",1533892062.0
BestUsernameLeft,"Good introductory tutorial. One point in addition to the feedback you've received. The initial implementation of `pop()` could have been the simpler `stack.remove(0)`, which might have suggested to you the value of a test that asserts the correct value is popped after two pushes.

I use spring dependency injection in my business layer.

why not go with something the candidate can relate to, e.g. an appointment scheduling api? you've got crud in there, rest api design and a wide range of business constraints which  (optionally) could / should be considered by the candidate. 

also, do yourself a favor and look for tests. at least unit tests, integration tests are a plus (both is easy using e. g. spring) ",1533508808.0
nutrecht,"I did something similar for a previous client where they had a few mis-hires. Basically it was a small REST service that performed some number crunching tasks (basiclly do a POST, do some mathy calculations, and return the results). It was an incremental assignment where they would start with the REST interface, handle validation, then move to unit testing and integration testing, etc. The project was ready to clone in a Git repo; so I handled all the boiler plate of setting up the Spring Boot project.

It worked very well in separating out the people who could talk the talk but not walk the walk, which was the main goal. The total interview process was around 2.5 hours; half an hour phone interview, one hour technical q&a and one hour 'peer programming' coding test. 

Something like this is easy enough to set up yourself (did it in 2 hours or so) and you can reuse it. It's also a good opportunity to have it 'fit' your domain much better than most canned tests do. ",1533542517.0

Short lived objects are generally what generational GC algorithms (pretty much all the OpenJDK ones are generational) are good at. It's likely that these are cheap enough to not worry about. If you worry about consuming resources, start by defining how much memory you are looking to consume. If your application has very little state (ergo a small live-set), perhaps all you need to do is set the max heap size to an acceptable size (-Xmx). Note that the default GC (G1GC since Java 9) is not a great fit for small heaps(< 1GB), and the parallel collector might be a good fit for you. Small applications can fit in pretty small heaps (e.g. 64m).

GCs don't usually give up. I suggest you enable some GC logging to find out what's going on. This would also enable people to give some concrete advice, rather than guess at what is going on.

Just create a few enums, stuff the data in there, and let your interfaces use these enums to guarantee some safety",1533309558.0
uniqualykerd,I use enums as test subjects in parameterized unit testing. 10/10 can recommend.,1533294822.0
DannyB2,"I use Enums to create

1. Mini-Tables, baked into the code.
2. Fixed list of selection items such as drop-down menu or set of option (eg ""radio"") buttons
3. HIERARCHICAL menus!  yes, really

An example of (1) would be the US States, Canadian Provinces, etc.  All with their Name, Country and 2-character ""postal code"".  These include military bases, etc.  The Country is actually another Enum type for the countries used in this table of states.

As an example of (2), any time the user interface (either Web UI or Swing UI) has some type of drop down menu, or a set of option buttons (eg, ""radio buttons""), I always use an Enum to represent these.  In a JSP it is easy to have a boilerplate template that forms the Html markup for the option buttons, or drop down selections.

As an example of (3), the main hierarchical menu structure of the application is an Enum.  The enum constructor takes a parameter of the type of the enum representing an item's parent.  That way, every Enum item has a parent of null, or a parent which is another item in this Enum.  From any Enum you can trace up the path of ancestors to the root item (usually called ""Home"").  I add other functions to the enum beneath the constructor that can generate a text version of breadcrumbs or an Html version of breadcrumbs with links.

Note that an Enum can only reference an earlier declared enum.  So I structure declarations like this.

`// Level 0`

`Home( null ),`

`// Level 1 items`

`Item1( Home ),`

`Item2( Home ),`

`// Level 2 items`

`Item1_1( Item1 ),`

`Item1_2( Item1 ),`

`Item2_1( Item2 ),`

`Item2_2( Item2 ),`

`Item2_3( Item2 ),`

`// Level 3 items`

`Item1_1_1( Item1_1 ),`

`Item1_1_2( Item1_1 ),`

etc

The constructor might actually look like:

`private MenuItem( MenuItem parent, String title, ActionClass action ) {`

`. . .`

`}`

The parent parameter would be a previously declared enum item which is the parent of the item being constructed.  The title would be the title of this enum item as displayed in the UI.  The ActionClass would be an interface type that all Action classes implement.  That is, the class, which is invoked in response to the user selecting this menu item.

Oh, and one more thing.  An Enum type can implement an interface!  The interface can have default methods.  The enum class (not an individual type) can have default implementations of some interface methods.  And then some or all individual enum declarations can override or provide implementations of some of the interface methods.

A common interface could have numerous default method implementations, and then multiple different enum classes could implement that same interface.  For example, for drop-down-menu enums.

Please fix the grammar:  

all of the enum members **require to** implement the method. Basically, enum members are instances of the enum and to make it instantiable, we need to implement all of abstract methods as **announemous** class at each of the enum member.

all of the enum members **are required to** implement the method. Basically, enum members are instances of the enum and to make it instantiable, we need to implement all of abstract methods as **anonymous** class at each of the enum member.

* refactoring (helpful when adding new features to existing code)
* test driven design (helpful when starting with only business requirements)
* domain driven design (especially helpful when working on larger projects)
* design patterns (always helpful but often difficult to recognize the opportunities to introduce them)

There a couple of good books:

*   Effective Java: [https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997)

blobjim,"[The Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_26KZAegYRM)

The fact that wait(), notify(), notifyAll(), hashCode(), toString(), and equals() will continue to exist and will throw exceptions, require implementation, or exhibit different behavior seems unacceptable to me.

What I don't get is why not just only treat a field, parameter, generic parameter, or local variable as a value type if it has a flag ACC\_VALUE set. This seems like the only real solution without creating all sorts of gotchas like they describe in the video. It means value types and Objects can stay entirely separate while still allowing classes to opt into being a value type, and client code can opt in to using value types, as their solution is intended to work. I don't see any good solution that will work where everything continues to be treated as an Object.

The only difference in code would be ""class Point2D"" becomes ""value class Point2D"" (to declare that the class doesn't extend object) and variable ""Point2D point"" becomes ""value Point2D point"" or ""value var point"". Any field/variable with the value keyword will not be considered of type Object and wouldn't contain any of the methods existing in Object.

~~A value type would then be able to be boxed into an Object if and only if it implements an interface Identifiable (which is also implemented by Object), which contains equals(), toString(), and hashCode(). Wait and notify would still be part of Object). The problem with this would be that a value class both would and wouldn't extend Object, and that the interface Identifiable would have to be special in that its methods couldn't be used on value fields/variables, so maybe it's just as icky of a solution... darn.~~",1533075926.0

Sipkab,">**No Surveys**  
>  
>We do not allow surveys.

Also, a survey that requires login. lol.

But regards to the subject, I vote for 'only exceptional cases'. I agree with u/cryptos6 that it is indeed a design weakness. However, there is one use case that I found:

When designing an API through interfaces, you might have two declarations:

    public interface Context { ... }
    public interface Child { Object doOnContext(Context context); }

In this case, the Child implementation might need to cast the context paremeter to the implementation class in order to execute the operation.

One might wonder: But why don't we use the Context as a factory for the Child implementation?

Well, the child instance might need to be serializable. In that case, the context cannot be serialized along with the child, and later after deserialization, it needs to be attached again. So instead of creating a reattach method on context, we pass the context as a parameter for the function call.

So in the end, the function implementation might look like this:

    public Object doOnContext(Context context){
        ContextImpl impl = (ContextImpl) context;
        ...
    }

I think that a thrown ClassCastException is fine in this case, as children should be used on their respective context instances, which is the responsibility of the API caller.

If you need to act based on the type of the parameter, there is also the Visitor pattern for you for other scenarios.",1532936851.0
dpash,"Yes, you should. In a number of situations.

* `Object.equals()` requires you to explicitly cast from `Object` to your type. 

* Bad API designs where you need to cast from a generic to a more specific object to get access to the required functionality. I'm looking you W3C DOM.  

* You're implementing a generic container class and some situation requires you to cast before returning to your users.

I'm sure there's others I forgot. It is a good idea to try to encapsulate your casts so you only do it in one place. If you're dealing with generics, rather than return `Object` or your base type, require a `Class<T>` to be passed in as a second parameter, so the cast happens in that function rather than for every caller. For an example, look at Spring's `BeanFactory.getBean(...)` functions. After Java 5, they replaced:

     java.lang.Object getBean(java.lang.String name)

with 

     <T> T getBean(java.lang.String name, java.lang.Class<T> requiredType)

That means you have:

     Bean bean = appContext.getBean(""bean"", Bean.class);

rather than 

    Object obj = appContext.getBean(""bean"");
    if (!(obj instanceof Bean)) {
        throw new CustomException(""not right bean class"");
    }
    Bean bean = (Bean)bean;

or

     Bean bean = (Bean)appContext.getBean(""bean"");",1532937206.0
cryptos6,"I consider explicit casts a design weakness most of the time. Since Java has generics, casting should be needed very rarely. In most cases it turns out that you haven't used generics properly (or not at all!), if you need explicit casting.",1532936264.0
eliasv,"So long as they're encapsulated it's fine. That is, don't design an API which requires your users to make casts idiomatically, and don't write code which risks throwing CCEs.

DannyB2,"I run multiple Java instances.  Multiple Eclipse instances.

I run Apache Tomcat instances, each possibly using a different Java version, for example, without ""installing"" Java, on Windows.  I even run MULTIPLE INSTANCES of Tomcat on a single Windows OS.  I create a SetPaths.bat which sets several environment vars:

@echo off

rem Server Instance Foobar06

set ""SERVICE\_NAME\_SUFFIX=Foobar06""

set ""CATALINA\_HOME=C:\\Foobar\\Servers\\apache-tomcat-8.0.52""

set ""JAVA\_HOME=C:\\Foobar\\Servers\\jdk1.8.0\_181""

set ""CATALINA\_BASE=%cd%\\CatalinaBase""

This goes in the CatalinaBase folder for a particular instance, such as Foobar06.  Where the product is named Foobar.  There might be multiple Foobar servers for development / testing.  Eg, Foober01, Foobar02, etc.

Notice that the SetPaths.bat specifies which Tomcat and which Java to use.  Note that Java HAS NOT been installed onto the Windows OS using any kind of a ""setup.exe"".  In fact, Tomcat hasn't been ""installed"" either.  It is just an unpacked zip, at the pathname specified above.

Next, create several scripts named:

service-control-panel.bat

service-install.bat

service-remove.bat

startup.bat

shutdown.bat

The startup.bat looks like this:

@echo off

call .\\SetPaths.bat

""%CATALINA\_HOME%\\bin\\startup.bat""

The service-install.bat looks like this:

@echo off

call .\\SetPaths.bat

""%CATALINA\_HOME%\\bin\\startup.bat""

Similarly you would create service-remove.bat, shutdown.bat.

The service-control-panel.bat looks like this:

@echo off

call .\\SetPaths.bat

""%CATALINA\_HOME%\\bin\\tomcat8w.exe"" ""//ES//%SERVICE\_NAME\_SUFFIX%""

As you can see, the first scripts simply set the paths for everything and then invoke the official Apache Tomcat scripts for startup / shutdown, or alternately service-install / service-remove.

You would use service-install / remove to install this Tomcat instance as a ""service"" under Windows.  (Start --> Administrative Tools --> Services control panel.)  Which lets the Tomcat start in the background as soon as Windows is booted, without logging in to the computer.

Or if you simply want to run Tomcat ""on the desktop"" you are logged into, then you would use startup.bat, which calls SetPaths.bat and then starts Apache Tomcat in a command window.  Don't close the command window.  Instead open another command window and run shutdown.bat, and the first command window will go away.  This tomcat is only running while you are logged into the computer desktop.

By replicating server folders Foobar01, Foobar02, etc, you can have multiple instances of Tomcat on a single Windows OS.  Each server instance can be using a different version of Java and/or a different version of Tomcat.  All of these servers can be individually installed as background services in Windows so they are always running, all the time, as long as the VM is booted.

On Linux I use a similar approach -- except I write a systemd unit file for each tomcat instance.  (Hey, that's what all distros are going to, so I'm just going with the flow.)

Someone else already explained that you can have as many different Eclipse instances as you want, running on the same Windows desktop, by pointing each Eclipse folders eclipse.ini to the appropriate unzipped Java folder.

In fact, nothing here is ""installed"" on windows.  When I'm done with a particular Java, or a particular tomcat, or a particular Eclipse, there is nothing to ""uninstall"".  Just pick up the Java / Tomcat / Eclipse folder and chuck it in the trash.

Hope that helps.",1532979735.0

Personally, I have used IntelliJ and Eclipse the most and I know the communities around those can help you if you get stuck.  

However... I suspect the IDE isn't your first problem.  Your first problem is learning Java and the way Object Oriented Programming is done in Java vs. Javascript.  They are different.  

So... get a good book or tutorial or PluralSight course or the like and just go learn Java.  Pick a course that speaks to you, and use whatever IDE or editor they recommend or use for that.  You'll learn a good way to do things this way and it will be a starting point.  

The next time you try to use Java to accomplish something, then it will get real and you'll have to commit to some set of tools just to get going.  At that point, you can use whatever you used to learn on, but you'll probably want to go with IntelliJ, NetBeans, or Eclipse.  Anything else is just a bit more difficult than it needs to be.

If you find yourself getting behind on your estimate, don't think you can ""cram"" to make it up, raise the issue in your standup immediately.  Ask for help.

If you're with a good team the reviews should be constructive and educational, but if you get defensive or upset because someone points out issues that doesn't play well.

_dban_,"> We consider a very bad practice to allow an external framework to tamper with the visibility of object properties.

Why is this considered a bad practice? 

Visibility guarantees are good for preventing other classes from depending on the implementation details of your class. But, in this case, the external framework (such as Hibernate Validator) doesn't depend on your code, but rather you are intentionally exposing details of the class to the external framework to use *its* features.

Which direction does the dependency arrow point? If a class depends on you, it's a good idea to hide details, so you are more free to change details without breaking the classes that depend on you. On the other hand, if you depend on a class, especially a framework, I don't see what difference it makes to allow the framework to reduce visibility of your code at runtime through reflection, if it is required for the external framework to work.",1532709088.0
gunnarmorling,Bean Validation 2.0 spec lead here; I always prefer putting constraints to getters instead of fields. That way the constraints are part of the bean's public API and as such visible and known to users of the class.

trydentIO,"in my opinion it would be better to get rid of a precise problem here: primitive obsession; instead of relying on the primitive type (int, string, double, float, long, char and boolean) you should implement an object which must be validated during its instantiation 

for instance: 
``` 
class Person {
  private int age;
  ... 
}

var p = new Person(999);
```

of course here you can use Bean Validation in order to fix such issue (since that person can not be that old... well I think): 

``` 
@Min(value=1, message=""d'oh"")
@Max(value=120, message=""d'oh"")
private int age; 
```

however if you pass such property to another method or object or variable: 

``` 
int age = p.getAge();
``` 

you totally lose the validation information and that age variable can be just anything; instead why can we create something which is always validated? 

``` 
class Age {
  private final int value; 
  private Age(int value) {
    this.value = value; 
  }
  // getter 

  public static Optional<Age> ageOf(int value) {
    return Optional.of(value)
     .filter(it -> it >= 1 && it <= 120)
     .map(it -> new Age(it));
  }
}

class Person {
  private Age age;
 ... 
}
``` 

as you can understand everytime you use Age you're always sure it has a validated value. I created a static factory method with Optional by purpose, since if anything goes wrong (in other words the value is not validated) then you can do whatever you need: throw a specific exception, or pass a default value. 

Such pattern is referred as Anti Primitive Obsession Pattern. You can find an extended explanation with C# examples in a nice article :)",1532731117.0

It's really good especially on complex, large pages and it can help you narrow down to elements of interest using text matching with wildcards. The code becomes way more readable as you almost never have to work with the tree of HTML elements, nor use XPATH nor CSS selectors.

Give it a go if you need to squeeze more performance out of your current solution - or if it's becoming difficult to code and maintain.

uniVocity,"While I appreciate the effort, there are some missing pieces here. For example, the classpath of dependencies used by your jar needs to be handled.
Your code doesn't seem to handle it, and I believe the existing `maven-jar-plugin` does what you want for you:

Let me give you my example:

	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
				<artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>2.5</version>
				<configuration>
					<archive>
						<manifest>
							<addDefaultImplementationEntries>true</addDefaultImplementationEntries>
							<addDefaultSpecificationEntries>true</addDefaultSpecificationEntries>
							<addClasspath>true</addClasspath>
							<classpathPrefix>lib/</classpathPrefix>
							<mainClass>com.univocity.parsers.html.Main</mainClass>
						</manifest>
					</archive>
				</configuration>
			</plugin>

Here `<mainClass>` will make the jar executable (as you can see in the generated jar's MANIFEST). If you simply double-click it then it should run.

The `<addClasspath>` will also introduce all dependency names in your pom to the MANIFEST

Finally `<classpathPrefix>` tells that all dependencies will reside inside a ""lib"" folder alongside the built jar.

Does your plugin do anything that the existing `maven-jar-plugin` doesn't?",1532574436.0

One of our premier JavaFX products is the Deep Space Trajectory Explorer featured [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZBa_tIBrRE&t=5880s) in the DevNexus Keynote.

Swing works... to be sure, I used it for years... but once you start using JavaFX you'll never want to go back. Very powerful stuff and with open source frameworks like those from Gluon you can very easily transpile your JavaFX applications to Android/iOS. 

Someone mentioned JavaFX being removed from the JDK for Java 11. That is true but then again a lot of packages are being moved outside of the core JDK into external modules. That's the whole point of the new module system... to separate functionality to allow for far leaner runtime bundles.  JavaFX is now open sourced and is available as part of the OpenJDK module set.

DuncanIdahos8thClone,"Properties at the language level is a bad idea. I'm glad Java doesn't have them.  

In Java it's very easy to explore new frameworks because you don't have to necessarily know the names of everything. Is it Width, Height, Size, Length, Depth? In C# I find myself doing "".W"" then "".H"" then "".L"" etc... In Java I can just to "".g"" to see all the getters and quickly see what I need. 

In C# there's no setter overloading. In Java I have had cases where I have a LocalDate property but I'd like convenience setters to allow string ""yymmdd"", long ms, ""y,m,d"" setters. This is not doable in C#.

Properties at the language level hide performance issues. In Java for example:

    for (int i=0; i<getCount(); i++) {
         setSomething(i);
    }

this is more obvious that this possibly slower depening on what those getters and setters are doing - not obvious all the time depending on the framework - could be web services or data access...

it's less obvious like this:

    for (int i=0; i<Count; i++) {
         Something = i;
    }

Or best

    int count = getCount();
    int counter = 0;

Something like \`getName()\` instead of \`name()\` is so stupid! This adds nothing but clutter to the code. Some developers even think they were writing OOP code, becaus they are using getters/setters. But these accessor methods encapsulate almost nothing, but making all the internal state public with a superficial level of indirection. If you really want to hide the internal state and create methods with a meaning in the domain you almost never end up with methods prefixed ""get"" and ""set"". See ""Domain Driven Design"" (DDD).

It is wise to separate dumb DTOs and business objects. Getters and setters make DTOs look a bit like business objects which could get even worse if the developers get confused by this.

Getters and setters are often an indicator of design flaws (and a lack of understanding in DDD).

* type names are in `CamelCase` with an initial capital
* method, field, parameter, and local variable names are `camelCase` with an initial small letter
* constants are `UPPER_CASE` with underscores
* type variables are single-letter or extremely short upper case names, e.g. `T`, `U`, `V`

It's startling how difficult it is to read code that doesn't follow these conventions. Most subtly, code that uses mixed-case names for type variables is incredibly confusing.

Yeah... no.

JavaFX was only ever apart of Oracle JDK by default. OpenJDK never had built in support for JavaFX. Since Oracle JDK no longer exists (for typical users anyway) as of Java 11 nor was OpenJDK the JRE & OpenJDK is now the primary JDK/JRE build, the first statement is a lie.

And you can \*still\* create your own OpenJDK with built in JavaFX support if you want, so the second statement is a lie too. I've done it myself on Linux and it's really not hard to do.

snoob2015,">It seems all other languages are ahead of Java as of now.

I think people use Java mostly for its ecosystem, not the language per se. From this perspective, only Kotlin is ahead of Java.

With Java (Kotlin), you have:

\- A lot of high quality libraries: Spring,  Apache Commons, Guava, JUnit ...

\- A superb IDE: No IDE can beat Intellij ( You dont even need to use UE,  just CE is enough)

\- High Performance: If performance is your priority, use Vertx instead Spring, the cons is it doesn't have a lot of ""magic"" like Spring.

\- Proper async implementation: You can try Coroutines in Kotlin, in the future, Java will have Fiber( [http://cr.openjdk.java.net/\~rpressler/loom/Loom-Proposal.html](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~rpressler/loom/Loom-Proposal.html) )",1531872104.0

Personally i switched my machine's default jdk to 10 when it was released and have not come across any issues that couldn't be resolved in a few minutes.

Java is very popular and i don't see a reason for the decline and even if, likely to another JVM language, but it's still running on the same JVM ecosystem.

super__mario,"If you are just starting I would be weary of basing my business on Java ecosystem. 

First, Oracle is moving Java to where their database product is currently, in terms of licensing.

This means, you are free to use the JDK and Oracle DB to develop, but you must pay to use it in production. 

This is starting from JDK 11, to be released in September 2018.

Essentially Java is now: stable, secure or free - pick any two.

You are of course free to use OpenJDK (which up to now has always had poorer performance than Oracle JDK and has had compatibility issues with slew of software). But OpenJDK is like green browser, there is no long term supported version, and you must keep upgrading to new release every 6 months is you want security updates.

Startups are about proving ideas anyway, and you should consider technologies, languages and eco systems that are faster to develop and get your product to market faster. I would look into Node.js (your UI is going to be Javascript anyway, so you will use and hire JS developers for sure).

yes, on the integration testing front, since the application will be deployed on wildfly, you will want to have arquillian as your runner. But for your database testing, you probably will want it to be mocked by something on memory ( hsqldb is great for this ).",1531511550.0

1. At the finest-grained level, you have environment tests.  This includes, but is not limited to the test suites of your libraries and runtime, heartbeat tests for your network connections, and similar tests to ensure that the things you assume work are, you know, on and working.
2. Your unit tests.  It's not ""wedged in there"".  You should be doing TDD.  The second D is both design and development.  And running those tests should be a part of your build process.
3. Integration tests.  There are ways to do this.  Use an in-memory JavaEE application environment or spin up a cloud instance, deploy to it, and run the suite against that cloud instance.  This is how you test network interfaces, database access objects, and the like.  Run this after a build succeeds (meaning it compiled, unit tests built, and the final deliverable artifact is generated successfully).  Since you're doing REST, RestAssured is your friend.
4. Functional tests.  Hello there, Selenium.  Automate all the things. Again, run these against a cloud server or continuous integration box.

If your CI mainly has tests that depend on a full test environment being live you will have a bad time. 

You can run your UI tests against a mocked backend, they will be much faster and less flaky. You can even set up contract testing for your own backend API to generate the mock server for your UI tests. 

For tests involving your database use an in-memory database like H2 or use docker to run an instance of your actual DB brand. Have sql scripts that initialize your test DB before you run your tests. ",1531547690.0
mabnx,"Note: I do not know how well this advice works for Java EE apps but it should work for Spring.

> Do I wedge JUnit in there to accomplish this? 

Yes, it works pretty well. I usually have two kinds of tests in junit:
1. unit tests - which sometimes test a single class, sometimes a larger module in isolation. But they do not 
2. integration tests (component tests?) - generally they run as much as possible with stubbed external dependencies. Usually this is the whole application, with database (these days usually in a docker container). Sometimes it's a larger module and I just call methods on some high-level interface. Calls to other services are stubbed and I tend to have some utility methods which every test uses to setup the stubs, e.g. stubCurrentUser(...), stubExchangeRates(...). Global defaults for stubbed calls do not work that well.

> How do I handle the underlying database itself? Rollback the transaction? What about testing my JAX-RS services? 

My preferred approach is to setup data for each tests separately and commit. It works if your data is partitioned in some obvious way. E.g. if there is per-account data, or per-oder data then you can setup each tests for a new accountId or orderId. 

Rollbacks can work, but then you need to make sure that the tested code does not commit anything. IMO the easiest way is to declare all transactions in your application as PROPAGATION_NESTED - it works as long as your setup uses safepoints for nested transactions.

> Do I test them as Java classes? Or do I test them as RESTful endpoints? 

I'm no sure what are you asking about - do you mean if your tests should the calling a method or issuing an HTTP request?
You need some tests to verify that the request/response format is ok and that they are properly serialized/deserialized. But the majority of integration tests could just call methods on HTTP controllers instead of issuing HTTP requests.
Using HTTP requests makes debugging tests harder because they go through all those various frameworks before reaching your code. Additionally your code probably runs in a different thread then the test itself so you can no longer rollback transactions easily.

In small applications this could be the only kind of tests that you need.

> I've heard mention of Arquillian as a good framework for unit/integration tests. Is this a recommended way of performing these kinds of tests?

I don't know, my advice is based on Spring rather than CDI/Java EE.

rngisforfailures,"I don't think it's so much about learning frameworks as it is what you can learn from frameworks. Plus, you aren't suppose to know everything. In the real-world, you will be on a team with junior and senior people, and you can always ask them. I don't think books are necessary, as there's a lot of free resources available online, you can consult Google and StackOverflow as needed.

You didn't declare whether you wanted to go down the UI or API side of development, but I will speak to the API side since that's the side I went down. Also, you don't have to learn these frameworks in any specific order. Think of it as a multi-headed beast, they are non-linear. You can learn some of one, then switch to learning a second framework, etc.

For a build framework, I would recommend Maven getting started. It has a static XML structure and it's the easiest to understand and troubleshoot. Gradle came after Maven, and is more like dynamic JSON, where it feels like you write code as part of your project definition. Plus, Gradle had a 24-hour dependency caching quirk I didn't like the last time I used it. 

You need to learn a logging framework as well. Three popular ones are log4j, slf4j and logback. You can also use sl4fj on top of log4j. The oldest is log4j, but I still see it used in practice 10 years later. Which one(s) you learn are not really important. Just don't use System.out.println() or System.err.println().

Learn how to write unit tests. JUnit and Mockito (mock non-static methods), maybe with PowerMockito on top (to mock some static methods).

The Spring Framework is a dependency injection framework. To me, Spring is configurable, inversion of control, and programming to interface. However, Spring and Spring Boot has introduced a whole bunch of @Annotations, that I consider black magic. You should really understand plumbing within Spring, before you start using the annotations shortcuts to hide the plumbing. I would exclude Spring Boot and microservice architecture from your initial pass. 

Similarly, learn a data-binding framework like Gson or Jackson. They can convert Strings to and from complex data model objects. Kind of an aside, but avoid Java's Reflection API initially. That's another kind of black magic. 

There are also caching and persistence frameworks like Memcache or Hibernate respectively. I don't have anything in particular to say about either, but I'm noting these so you'll be aware of them. Feel free to Google them.


Version control: You have Subversion or Git. Subversion is the more simple and straightforward option, but Git is more flexible and complicated. This isn't necessary to know initially, but once you start working with a team, you will need to know this. You can learn about branching, merging and pull requests.

Java 8, 9, 10, etc: Streams are convenient, and knowing the latest features is nice-to-have. You can ""de-nest"" for-loops, but this is not as important in my opinion. It is the same concepts, just re-dressed so you can write cleaner code.

Agile, Scrum, Kanban and Lean are software development frameworks. Don't learn any of these. Each company I've worked at does it differently and they may not actually be for the best.

From there, there's a bunch of technical subjects, like web servers, HTTP protocol, HTTPS+certificates, security that aren't particularly bound to frameworks. Learning how to debug issues is invaluable, and that doesn't just mean using a debugger on your local DEV environment.

Then there's some non-technical concepts like team and social dynamics.",1531546274.0

What you'll end up doing will really depend on the architecture.

4) JDK 8 *public* updates will end January 2019.  Non-commercial users will still get automatic updates until the end of 2020.

5) Oracle binaries of JDK 11 will no longer be free for use in production, only for development, testing and demos. Donald Smith, Oracle Product Manager tweeted about this, https://twitter.com/DonaldOJDK/status/977971082706612224 and the Oracle Java SE support page makes this clear, http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/eol-135779.html

6) OpenJDK binaries from Oracle will only be provided until the next JDK release (i.e. six months). This means that there is no LTS for free.  Oracle will *not* backport fixes from newer releases to older OpenJDK versions.  See Mark Reinhold's presentation on this, https://youtu.be/HqxZFoY_snQ?t=715

7) Users who wish to continue to use JDK 8 or JDK 11 beyond the end of free public updates will need a support contract from Oracle (https://youtu.be/YauqubC8FKM?t=1282). Alternatively, they can choose another supplier like Azul (full disclosure, I work for them). https://www.azul.com/products/zulu-and-zulu-enterprise/. 

8) The AdoptOpenJDK project is building free binaries but it is not clear yet who will do the (potentially complex) work of backporting fixes to older JDK versions from the current one.

# Using Mozilla's Certificate Authority List for Java SSL

[https://www.petefreitag.com/item/830.cfm](https://www.petefreitag.com/item/830.cfm)

The reason I think this may be useful is because Mozilla goes to a LOT of trouble to maintain a good list of certificate authorities.  It sure would be nice if I could just use that in openjdk.

Okay, it does . . .

\#!/bin/sh

curl -o certdata.txt '[https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt?raw=1](https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt?raw=1)'

perl mk-ca-bundle.pl -n > ca-bundle.crt

java -jar keyutil-0.4.0.jar --import --new-keystore trustStore.jks --password changeit --import-pem-file ca-bundle.crt

So where does that [mk-ca-bundle.pl](https://mk-ca-bundle.pl) come from?

More googling . . . and I find this:

[https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl)

It looks like it is part of curl.

The next question is where does that keyutil.jar come from?

[https://github.com/use-sparingly/keyutil](https://github.com/use-sparingly/keyutil)

So this seems like a possible solution.

But here I find Mozilla's cacerts in PEM format:

[https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html)

I think keyutil could import that into a JKS keystore.  But can openjdk directly use a cacerts.pem keystore?

Also see this StackOverflow question:

XML is going to be least of your worries when developing an mobile app. And yeah, you need to know it, but that thing is trivial compared to for example designing the app architecture.  Same as knowing Java is only fraction of required knowledge to write an app.

There are many tutorials on Android development, also I am sure many books, so go slowly from beginning and learn about Java, gradle, Android APIs, Android app architecture & workflows, layouts & UX  and most importantly, try to understand what you're doing instead of just copy pasting code from tutorials.

SatanicOnion,"LibGDX allows for seamless cross platform development

This means you could code once, and run it on not only Android, but also iOS, Windows, Mac, and browser. It also means you can **ignore XML completely**, and program it like any other java  desktop software, if you so chose. (Although, it's really not that hard, it's just annoying at times for me. You'll have much more complex things to be dealing with, than XML, though). 

It is a framework that *can* be complicated, but you have the freedom to literally ignore all of it and simply use it for it's input and graphics handling. I'm building my own game engine that isn't using any of the built in Scene2D stuff, but if you're a better programmer than (most likely) it isn't that hard to implement. 

You don't get any of the built in layouts that Android Studio allows you to manipulate (the XML stuffs), but you also then aren't restricted by them. You can make your app look and behave exactly as you want. 

And, again, it has the plus of being a single code base for exporting to iOS (that's two platforms with mobile app stores), and Desktop.

Some frameworks work well for some applications and not well for others. I don't think it's appropriate to say with any surety that neither Spring nor Hibernate have no place.

Advantages of Hibernate (or another ORM): time-to-market, cross-platform support. Those are the biggest ones, really. You can add persistence to an application very quickly and expand it as necessary at low cost. One application will work on Oracle, MySQL (as well as anything works on MySQL), Postgres, or even some non-RDBMS data stores. Drawbacks: can be slow as fuck for large and complex queries.

Spring: it's really not a bad thing. If you want to use an OSGI framework instead of Spring, that's cool, it's tomato and tomahto, IMO. I've met some people that think any line of XML is equivalent to being fucked by the devil, but, you can do your config in lots of different ways that require no XML at all. There are so many ways to do what you want with Spring, that I am really not aware of any logical resistance to it. That being said, if you do want to go full-OSGI like Apache Karaf, that's different and you wouldn't want Spring. To me, they're interchangeable in concept, so not a big deal.

Learn Spring and learn Hibernate. Implement Spring in new projects (Spring Boot) if you can. Implement Hibernate in new projects, too. When necessary for performance, jump directly into SQL. For most projects, I find Hibernate covers 90-95% of use cases easily and quickly. The 5-10% left I can do as one-off joins with custom ResultSets (which you can probably do by digging in deep in Hibernate, if you want).

uniqualykerd,"I learned SQL before most of my other programming languages, including java, and thus can whip up most CRUD commands quite fast. 
  
The problem I faced with a JPA (like Hibernate) is that it requires a whole lot of additional boilerplate. Writing my own SQL against a simple JDBC data source was much easier to understand and produce. In most cases my applications don't need all that functionality. 
  
The people behind Spring Data also saw that, and aimed to reduce the boilerplate by introducing conventions and code generation. Once you understand how that works, it's fast to set up. 
 
My applications also haven't needed the web services part of Spring Boot. I'm still researching whether I can use Spring Data without all the web services functionality. 
  
The last challenge I face is that I really want my data entities to be immutable, and most of the JPA and Hibernate tutorials I see all assume mutable java beans. Short of the repetitive boilerplate, the java beans methodology as well as most of the generators I've seen make mutable entities by default. Recently I learned that newer versions of Hibernate can be configured to pretend data access is immutable, but that doesn't make the class instances themselves immutable. 
  
That said: when I did write a full-blown data manipulator using java, I dug  through Spring Data and Hibernate's source code to find out how they solved issues I was facing.

I have no idea why you think Spring is going away anytime soon. For Hibernate, I can start to see the writing on the wall. JPA kind of broke a lot of the earlier Hibernate stuff and wrapped it into it's own libraries. It just seems like there is less and less of it the way things are evolving. I for one have always hated Hibernate. For someone that is decent at writing their own queries it's just a huge pain in the ass and I feel like it constantly gets in the way.

so with that out of the way you can find people and have them implement your business stuff without the need for them to learn your own code or exotic framework.

davewritescode,"I’ve been developing in Java for 10 years and let’s just say I’ve seen some shit in production.  I don’t think it’s fair to lump spring in with hibernate so I’ll evaluate them separately.

Spring is a great framework compared to what came before it and spring boot addresses a lot of what makes vanilla spring annoying to work with.  That said it uses a lot of magic and it can surprise you in ways that you don’t expect.  It makes heavy usage of proxies which means it pollutes the shit out of your stack traces.  My current work place has dozens of microservices running on spring processing, in some cases hundreds of thousands of requests per second at peak (data ingestion pipeline).  There’s nothing about spring itself that prevents you from scaling a properly architected application.

Hibernate/JPA is a horrible piece of technology that lures you in with how well it handles the easy cases.  It works perfectly for demos and prototypes but as soon as you need to do something complicated it can get to be unwieldy.  It builds a very complicated metamodel on top of SQL that can behave in very unexpected ways.  You end up needing to be a hibernate expert as well as a SQL expert to leverage it well.  I’m sure it’s possible but it’s, in my opinion, completely not worth it.

GhostBond,"> From bad performance to making it, allegedly, harder to code and debug (because you're now coding to the framework), there is some VERY strong opposition in-house.  

Where do you work and how can I get a job there?? That sounds awesome.  

Hibernate is terrible. There is literally never any reason to use it other than ""I have to because of my job"". For complicated cases it's terrible. For easy cases you can write the simole queries needed directly un the same anount of time it takes to type out the hubernate annotations to do it. They're very repetitive.  

Spring is more of a mixed bag with it doing a decent job of simplifying some stuff, but then in other areas you get into some real wackiness with 15 ways to do something, or unexpected behavior (like I'm looking at a project where the ""architects"" thought dependency injecting parameters into rest controllers would be a good idea, not realizing having instance variables would have threading issues and end up with the wrong data because of race conditions).

If your DB is not performing well, you can also throw money at the problem (It is 2018, even my desktop has a 6-core cpu). You could use a DB cluster. The performance increase is incredible (see postgresql + wal).

Really great book imo. Its the first time I've actually understood what microservices are since the author guides you through coding a real example and talks about pros and cons. 

The only criticisms I have of it is the author over engineers everything by creating interfaces then meaningless XYZImpl classes which drown the reader in unneeded boilerplate. Plus the UI is some very sketchy jquery but I dont blame the author for this seems the book is not about creating a UI 

I used docker and created my own react UI which made deploying all the services a lot easier whereas the author installs everything on local machine which can get hard to keep track of.

I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to code their first microservice by following along rather than just reading the book without doing anything.

lightjay,"I would recommend Angular 6 or React based frontend - SPA web apps allow pretty straightforward migration of existing workflows (quite contrary standard Spring MVC based Request / Response model), as it's still application running on client side that doesn't throw away all of it's state when it loads new page. The real pain with Request / Response based MVC solutions is that you have some of the state on the client, some of the state on the server, you need to write part of the frontend in JS, rest of the logic is in Java. 

That's why it's so much better to have everything in the client and just use REST services when you need to do something on the server. It also has better performance, client can cache lot of data, it has very low latency as it doesn't need to contact server to perform every operation. 

We have rewritten several Swing / SWT apps to Angular and it was pretty straightforward task - we could keep most of the app logic and workflows and in the end, it was just different language and widgets. And as we're Java devs, we got very easily familiar with TypeScript and Angular (strongly typed language, dependency injection etc.). ",1531050934.0

So we ended up switching off GWT and over to WebStart talking to our backend to get around the problem.

If you decide to go with web based solution, either something like GWT or JavaScript with Angular, make sure you don't run into those type of issues.

As for why: I think SLF4J is very good, logback is well understood and supported within the company (we have some extra appender which transmits the log because the original one was using way too many connections). Also it is widely supported with custom adapters.

Log collection is just because we need that (quasi-microservices architecture), I think that's the most common stack for central log collection (just feeling, no data behind this statement).

talios,"I've not used it yet - but I'm quite intrigued by Google's new [Flogger](https://google.github.io/flogger/) API - the ""fluent logger"", which aims to to keep a more cleaner/consistent API:

```java
logger.atInfo().withCause(exception).log(""Log message with: %s"", argument);
```

Instead of overloading `.log()` with throwables that mess up var args, or a custom `{}` format string, you ultimately end up with an interface with very few `.log()` overloads that take a standard printf style format. Want an exception logged? That's injected via a call to `withCause()`.

I also like the idea of the `atInfo()` style methods, if that log level is disabled, then a NO-OP log object is returned so no need to litter the code with `if debug` type constructs.

If the argument you're passing to the log line is expensive to render, you can wrap it with `lazy( () -> some.argument() )` which will defer the actual rendering.

There is support for system logging, and log4j logging ( and probably wouldn't be hard to add an slf4j backend as well ).

Code wide it may be more verbose, but it does seem to give more clarity - and I love some of extra features, like `atMost`.

Wow. No notifications or communication, they just turned it off. I couldn't figure out why IntelliJ was showing me jRebel license activation errors. I guess that's why.

Granted, there is a big variety of code out there so my experience isn't necessarily representative, but I can count on one hand the number of times I've wanted to embed a multiline string literal in my code in the last year, whereas building strings with embedded variable values is practically a daily need and is one of the reasons I enjoy working in Kotlin more than Java these days.

Welcome to software development. 

No current language, no technology stack, no framework, and no library have any such insurance. So, what you are saying is only partly correct. The correct part is that one shouldn't fully limit themselves, but on the other hand, spreading out too far is probably even worse.

Finally - seek mentorship. This is difficult, but can be partially achieved as a direct continuation of the previous step - if you've gotten into some open source project you can start looking at their bug tracker for bugs or feature requests, or maybe come up with your own features.

kodablah,"Reading the code, the implementation is poor. The agent appears to transform method bytecodes and essentially makes one call for every method arg to a another static method, but it does a try/catch around each one. It also creates two local variables to track ms (and appears it's not a finally block that the end happens, so I suppose it'd not capture method times when they throw). They don't need a second local var for capturing the end time when they can just subtract from the result of current ms and the start on the stack. It's using javassist (even though altering the bytecodes with asm is pretty easy) and calls it to insert string-based Java code for the instrumented methods each time. Javassist of course has to convert this code to bytecode every single time. That's amateur ridiculous instrumentation. So it'll increase your class size by several insns per arg, and slow your class loading down quite a bit.

A Java agent impl is fine and putting some simple insns at the top for statically relaying the method args is easy to do w/ lightweight asm invoke calls. But be careful storing the reference to these args, it becomes a large set of references quite fast. Then a local var for start ms and simple try/finally style handler is not too hard either to capture duration. The finally call would of course have the other method invoking currentMillis instead of burying that invocation at the end of every method. You could use JVMTI C API directly instead if you wanted (I've done this from both Rust and Kotlin Native before), but it doesn't give you much more than a Java instrumenter (unless you wanted to go the MethodEntry and MethodExit event callback route, but that's slower and not good for profiling).

You can use JSF with [Primefaces](https://www.primefaces.org/showcase/), but I'm not really sure about how well this integrates with Spring. The simpler integration is with the JavaEE stack. You'd be making calls to methods on CDI beans instead of Spring beans.

Apache Wicket is pure Java, but integrates easily with Spring. However, I'll leave it to you to judge how cool [its features](http://examples8x.wicket.apache.org/index.html) are. It's not nearly as popular as JSF, so pre-built components will be harder to come by.

Luckily nowadays, the choices are much more and there are a lot of quality frontend frameworks to pick from. Or not luckily? (the paradox of choice).  

I love the competition and I believe it's the biggest motivation for better results to the end user. Think Android vs iOS, Chrome vs FF, and also all those frontend frameworks. And that's the reason why there is a Vaadin 10 (or Vaadin platform) today.  

In my opinion, the choice of a specific framework, programming language, database ..etc has a lot of factors. Skills of the team, type of application, backend, ..etc.    
Things like scalability, structure, coupling, theming, and much more of the points discussed in the replies here are dead answered in several blog posts, tutorials, webinars ..etc. But let's not go there, and back to the points mentioned by the OP:  

* **Something similar that works good with spring?**    
More important question, do you want to stay with Java? Your team has capacity to have a separate JS developers to work on the ""frontend""?    
Follow up question, what is the thing you liked about Vaadin that you want similarity to? if it's mainly something that works best with Spring then I would say most if not all of the top frontend frameworks works good with spring. It probably feels more integrated when using a Java framework though.  
* **A bit more up to date?**    
Why not VueJS, AmberJS, Dojo ..etc?    
If you believe that Reactjs (your choice) is the most up to date and modern framework then definitely take it without too much thinking.    
But if you are stroke with the paradox of choice, you can maybe try to check the community activity, response to bugs/feature requests, the pace of development and alignment with modern web technologies ..etc. Hopefully this can reduce the choices a bit.  
* **All cool features are for ""paid"" users?**    
Correct me if I'm wrong, is it Vaadin Designer? I personally find it one of the coolest things that is only available for pro users.. but other stuff like getting instant chat with an expert or code on demand are, well, not free for obvious reasons.    
But they do exist! according to the pricing page on Vaadin website, all the non-free stuff do not exist at all in other top frameworks like Angular and React.    
You can not get things like support from Google or ask a React expert some questions .. or even more ask them to fix a bug for you as a priority. And no, they don't have a visual designer either.  

**Web native** mentioned somewhere below as well. There is a very nice article and video about this topic, and I promise it has no single mention about Vaadin Framework :-) Exploring the state of modern web development and the near future of the frontend: [https://vaadin.com/blog/going-web-native](https://vaadin.com/blog/going-web-native)

Now I'm using this framework for all of my new projects. It's purely a *Java* server side framework. It provides great flexibility for UI development. Unlike *vaadin* it doesn't provide ready components instead it provides java classes for all tags and attributes to build the UI. for eg if we are creating a text box in the ui we have to use something like *new Input(this, new Type(Type.TEXT))* but in vaadin it's new *TextField()*. *webfirmframework* gives much more performance than not just *vaadin* but other frameworks as well.

*Vaadin* stopped giving support for Table and they came up with a new concept called Grid that made me a lot of trouble because we had a lot of stuff done on top of Table and we had to add more features in it. Have a look at the documentation of *webfirmframework* at [http://webfirmframework.github.io/developers-guide/get-started.html](http://webfirmframework.github.io/developers-guide/get-started.html) it must be very useful to you.

Another advantage of *webfirmframework* is it provides a free tool which can convert any html code to java code it will solve almost all of your questions like *""How to create table in webfirmframework""*. Try it at [https://webfirmframework.com](https://webfirmframework.com).

I can not follow the comments below that claim Vaadin does not scale. In my experience it is super fast. However as it is a monolithic deployed web app, it obviously can not scale via micro services deployed in a cloud.

Angular or ReactJS are browser based. That means you have to code the interaction with the server yourself, you need to know how a DOM looks like and basically address ""your widgets"" via id or name tags.

You're talking about something that you need to fix, not mitigate.

EDIT: And the fact that this strategy for dealing with certain (majority) cases of Exceptions is even available in Java is a good example of the level of granularity of control the language gives you. But you have to master the basic concepts to use the language, otherwise you're just wandering in the dark.

_ramsey_,">is this ""checked exception"" thing still annoying for experienced Java programmers?

In most functional languages, you have an Either<A,B> type. Java's standard library doesn't have one, but that doesn't mean it can't support one. I wrote an Either<A,B> type in Java, specifically for handling checked exceptions. It's in a library called [trylambda.](https://github.com/nullterminated/trylambda) It requires Java8+, but it turns

    try {
        URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        //handle e
    }

into 

    Either<Exception, URLConnection> result = Try.either(() -> url.openConnection());

This is particularly useful in lambda streams where rethrowing the IOException as a RuntimeException would terminate stream processing. With an Either<A,B> type, you can continue passing results down to the end of processing Bs, where you can then handle all exceptional As in one place.

codemssterg,"I agree that checked exceptions can be annoying. API designers tend to use them so that their method signatures must declare them, in that way they are forced to appear along with the method's parameters, name, and return type.  I don't necessarily think that is a good reason to throw a checked exception though.

Use the following guidelines:
- only attempt to catch an exception if you can actually recover from the error or retry the request
- if you cannot provide meaningful recovery, as others have suggested catch checked exceptions, and rethrow them as runtime exceptions. This will will not force callers of your method to add a catch or declare throws. You can still choose to add a throws clause to your method signature to make it clear that your method can throw exceptions, but since they are runtime exceptions, it won't force the caller to deal with them. 

Many popular Java frameworks design their APIs to only use runtime exceptions so that they do not force user's of their classes to handle exceptions.

As for annoyances. It's when working with old code and you see Exceptions that don't get thrown. And the dev who wrote it, simply do:

    catch(Exception e) { 
      log.error(""Error in processing price""); 
    }

I wish Java made it so that in catch blocks, non-experienced (or even experienced) developers don't do this annoying code.

rzwitserloot,"I wouldn't say 'largely'. Nevertheless, knowledge of how threads work comes up from time to time.

#The problem

The problem with threads is this: You introduce an explosion of execution paths. Instead of a simple 'first java executes the first line of this method, then, it executes the second line of this method, all the way to the end', it becomes: ""An arbitrarily chosen thread chooses an arbitrary number of instructions to execute, then, the VM will make an arbitrary choice as to whether or not to make any changes to fields this thread performed visible to other threads unless you've done a good job on reading the java memory model to ensure propagation of these changes"".

The former is easily understood. The latter is (largely) untestable and unfollowable, and therefore, fine strategy to write code that looks good, passes all tests, runs great on your machine... and bombs in production 5 days later, in a way that is utterly mystifying; no exception pointing at the problem. The problem won't be reproducible (do the same thing, click the same buttons, feed in the same data... and now it works fine. And then tomorrow when that important customer logs in, it'll fail again on you). Finding a bug like this is _literally_ on the order of 100 to 1000 times harder to find, so avoiding even one such bug is 'worth' having 100 others.


Nevertheless, using all the cores in your CPU is [A] practical, in that just running it all on one can be unacceptably wasteful for performance, but more importantly [B] inevitable, because you don't write every line of code in your app yourself (you use libraries; the core java.* libraries at the very least), and THOSE will sometimes use threads.

So, what is a programmer to do?

My advice: Anytime you get to threading, try to push towards going big or going small; in both cases, you NEVER call ANY method on Thread (possibly you do some Thread.sleep in the 'going big' style), you have no need whatsoever of 'synchronized', no state is shared between threads, and you don't create new threads (some framework / library  does this for you).

# Going big

Write or use a framework which is the execution framework for your own actual business code. For example, a web framework is such a thing: You start it, it does things, and then it runs your code. Generally in these cases you do not write public static void main, or you do, but all that your main does is fire up the framework whilst you configure it or pass to it a bunch of 'handlers', and then the voodoo black box does its work.

Such frameworks are really good at setting up threading. This way each handler can be in its own little world; if a thread shares no data with any other, reasoning about threads is much, much simpler. Take webservers: Any given web handler simply does not get to interact with other handlers. It's not like you can ask the web framework for a list of WebHandler objects that you can then call methods on.

There will still be a need to interact, of course. However, in such environments the interaction is very tightly controlled via specialized calls. For web frameworks, the interaction is usually 'I use an appropriate transaction level and interact (with transactions) with a database; my communications with other handlers works via this database, as they will end up reading what I write, and this database intermediate makes reasoning about the flow of data much simpler'. Other options are things like rabbitMQ.

# Going small

Reduce the code that needs to run multithreaded to the smallest possible thing it can be, and then write a single stream/collection based operation that uses threading to apply this operation to a great many inputs concurrently. The fork/join framework is the usual go-to here. Imagine you are writing a bitcoin miner. This operation can be described as follows:

GIVEN: A list of a few million randomly generated codes to try, and exactly 1 input block.

TASK: Write the hash into that 1 input block, hash it, and see if the hash ends up having the appropriate amount of 0s at the very end.

You can do this by going small: Write a trivial method (it won't be larger than half a screen's worth, that's common in this 'go small' model) which injects the code into the block, hashes it, and returns an empty string if the hash is not suitable, and if you hit the jackpot, returns the block. Add to this a 'reducer' which takes in all results and returns only those that aren't empty.

# Libraries

In practice, especially for the 'going big' route, you may need to have a cache or some such that should be shared between whatever threads your webframework is making for you, but try to find libraries for this too. There are some tricks to interacting with such libraries. Generally, you have to go 'atomic'. For example, you can use the various collections in the `java.util.concurrent` package, but, the only guarantees it can make is that a single method call does the right thing. It cannot guarantee that a series of calls does the right thing. So, don't do this:

	if (concurrentMap.containsKey(myKey)) {
		String v = concurrentMap.get(myKey);
		operateOn(v);
	}

because you have no guarantee that `containsKey` will be consistent with your later `get` call. Instead, find a way to do it in one call. Here, it's simple. Do this:

	String v = concurrentMap.get(myKey);
	if (v != null) {
		operateOn(v);
	}

another example: Don't do:

	String v = myCache.get(myKey);
	if (v == null) {
		v = doExpensiveCalculationOfValue(myKey);
		myCache.put(myKey, v);
	}

instead, do:

	String v = myCache.computeIfAbsent(myKey, k -> doExpensiveCalculationOfValue(k));

it's even shorter to boot ;)

# Lessons

* Use frameworks, either large: Web frameworks, or small: fork/join, hadoop, or other map-reduce-style stuff.
* thread-to-thread communication uses abstractions like message busses (rabbitMQ and such) or databases.
* if you MUST have direct thread-to-thread interop, use libraries with collections types that are designed for this, such as `java.util.concurrent` and guava's `CacheBuilder` stuff. When interacting with these collections, know that consecutive method calls to them have no guarantees of internal consistency, so reduce it to 1 call. Be aware of methods like map's `computeIfAbsent` to enable this.

Involving third-party libraries is a pain because of the customer's particular deployment environment, so unless it's absolutely necessary (and not just ""really convenient""), the smaller stuff just gets coded by hand rather than dragging in yet another dependency.

>Is multi-threading largely involved in your day to day work like synchronized methods/ blocks and what do you use it for?

For most of the code, we don't need to use sync blocks, because proper data flow is already handled.

MasterLJ,"It's kind of a loaded question as a lot of us use them even when we don't actively code them.  Lots of server based libraries, like Spring, use threads quite a bit (particularly ThreadLocal), same with many of the popular clients for data retrieval.  Even more obviously, your servlets are using giant thread pools to service incoming requests.  Somehow I doubt that's what OP was asking explicitly, but none-the-less, I suspect that many people answering ""almost never"" here, are actually using threads without knowing it.

Personally, I use threadpools a lot, but I'm sort of a one-off case as I'm the sole developer for my own company, with all of my own tech.  Using threads willy-nilly on  a server, particularly one in which multiple developers share, can wreak havoc on performance and lead to very inconsistent performance issues.  Most of my services are very under-utilized, so it's a cost I can afford.

I have one very core service that used to use threading that ended up blowing up the service (this is admittedly, really bad design).  It's since been refactored and chunked out to the service level.  Meaning, instead of this service partitioning the job and using multiple threads to get through it faster, everything is paginated, and clients throw smaller chunks at the service behind rate limited calls (Hystrix).  Although, once again, this is not great design, and could benefit greatly from a queue.  Truth be told, the service is running fine currently, so choosing the absolute perfect architecture is not a high priority, but may come when things slow down.",1530299491.0

Xirema,"I recently ended up using some multithreading to make a very trivial program less painful to execute.

# The Problem

I needed to simulate a lot of dice rolls. Like on the order of billions of dice rolls, and I needed to do it a bunch of times for a bunch of similar but slightly variant conditions (and my knowledge of statistics wasn't good enough to just calculate the expected result). It kind of looked like this:

    public static class Calculator {
        private int attackerBonus, defenderBonus;
        public Calculator(int atk, int def) {attackerBonus = atk; defenderBonus = def;}
        public Results calculate() {
            int numOfTrials = 100_000_000;
            int successes = 0, failures = 0, draws = 0;
            Random rand = new Random();
            for(int i = 0; i < numOfTrials; i++) {
                int atkRoll = rollD20(rand) + attackerBonus;
                int defRoll = rollD20(rand) + defenderBonus;
                if(atkRoll == defRoll) draws++;
                if(atkRoll < defRoll) failures++;
                if(atkRoll > defRoll) successes++;
            }
            return new Results(successes, failures, draws, numOfTrials);
        }
    
        private static int rollD20(Random rand) {
            return rand.nextInt(20) + 1;
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            Calculator calculator = new Calculator(i, 0);
            Results results = calculator.calculate();
            System.out.println(results);
        }
    }

Now, no matter what, that's going to take some time, but you know what takes even longer? Starting each set of dice rolls only after the previous set has finished. That's a bit ridiculous.

Fortunately, Java offers a very elegant solution to this particular problem domain: Executors. Instead of running all these calculations sequentially, I can run them in parallel, and save a lot of time:

    public static class Calculator implements Callable<Results>{
        private int attackerBonus, defenderBonus;
        public Calculator(int atk, int def) {attackerBonus = atk; defenderBonus = def;}
        public Results calculate() {
            int numOfTrials = 100_000_000;
            int successes = 0, failures = 0, draws = 0;
            Random rand = new Random();
            for(int i = 0; i < numOfTrials; i++) {
                int atkRoll = rollD20(rand) + attackerBonus;
                int defRoll = rollD20(rand) + defenderBonus;
                if(atkRoll == defRoll) draws++;
                if(atkRoll < defRoll) failures++;
                if(atkRoll > defRoll) successes++;
            }
            return new Results(successes, failures, draws, numOfTrials);
        }
    
        @Override
        public Results call() throws Exception {
            return calculate();
        }
    
        private static int rollD20(Random rand) {
            return rand.nextInt(20) + 1;
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
        List<Future<Results>> resultFutures = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            resultFutures.add(executor.submit(new Calculator(i, 0)));
        }
        for(Future<Results> resultFuture : resultFutures) {
            Results results = resultFuture.get();
            System.out.println(results);
        }
    }

Note how this required very little boilerplate to be added to the code, and it represents a tremendous speed-up in terms of the code's overall execution time. And this is just one example of a very trivial program which could have multithreading added for very little effort, and significant gains.

Now, Java (and most other programming languages, like C++, python, etc.) also offer more low-level constructs, like directly creating Thread objects yourself and using constructs like `join()` or `synchronized` to get the exactly control you need. And if that's what you need, then that's what you need. But my example should show how easy it can be to improve an application's performance, given particular kinds of workloads.",1530307988.0

TheChiefRedditor,"How often I use Threads directly? Not really that often. However I'm frequently fixing production problems caused by people who didn't understand how to write Thread-safe code in the context of a multi-Threaded environment. I do a lot of Java web application work where I'm writing webapp code that runs in Tomcat or some other naturally multi-threaded JEE based web container. A perfect example happened just last week. A developer had written some code that did lazy-initialization of some expensive system resources that were meant to be ""singleton"" types of things (resource initialized one time then reused).  But because he failed to understand the nature of how threading works inside a web container (basically each user request is a separate Thread) and failing to properly synchronize the initialization of the resources, his code brought the production server crashing down shortly after startup.

How did it happen? Well a server restart was issued during business hours to address some issues with hung Threads due to DB lock contention (another common problem caused by failure to understand how to properly design applications that run in multi-threaded contexts). Users were actively using the system at the time the restart was issued but lots of help desk calls were coming in so the restart was deemed necessary to get the system responsive again while the DEV and DBA teams were investigating the possible cause. Well, when the server was restarting, user requests were queuing up in Tomcat waiting for the HTTP port to become open for business. As soon as it did, about 30 requests came flooding into the application all at the same time. This lazily initialized expensive resource that was supposed to be a singleton (was meant to be initialized by the first request that needed it and then never again) ended up actually getting initialized about one time for each request because it was not properly guarded. Needless to say within a couple minutes the system came down again due to resource exhaustion. If the restart had happened during off hours where there were few user requests going on, this bug would likely not have manifest itself and remained hidden indefinitely. But the stars aligned just right in this situation and it reared its ugly head.

Sadly, I've seen this kind of thing from not only new/junior developers (for whom its sort of forgivable..they're learning) but just as often as not from so-called ""senior"" or ""lead"" developers. Moral of the story? Threading is hard. But if as a developer you want to try to skirt having to understand it in todays development world, please just go be a real estate agent or something. You're only making life harder for the rest of us.

aenigmaclamo,"Most of the time a multithreaded solution is not the right approach, particularly for performance reasons. Multithreaded code is often very difficult to debug and is done as a micro-optimization.

You'll usually just have a problem that's to just dispatch independent jobs  without any shared mutable data where you generally don't have to worry about synchronizing data. Or, you'll be able to transform a problem so that you don't need to worry about synchronization.

With Spring, all the threading stuff is handled through an annotation or the usual thread per request. If you want to do IO operations, the job on the current thread probably depends on it, so it's fine to just block until it's done. As far as sharing state between calls -- just let the database handle the synchronization.

All in all, it's good to know the basics for the rare task that might require multithreading, but it's more useful to learn the higher level constructs like the tools your library gives you, `Future`s, and using Java 8's parallel streams.",1530293637.0

As a professional I am one of a few people at my company that uses IntelliJ, mostly everyone uses STS or Eclipse. The company even offers an in house IDE built on Eclipse. For me to switch to another IDE would have a learning curve to learn how functionality I am used to in IntelliJ compared to the others. Tbh, as others have already mentioned, focus more on learning the language. 

Try a few IDEs out and see which one you are most comfortable with. Like me, you may find the one you learn with first as your preferred IDE. Once you find your preferred you can check Udemy or YouTube for a course that can show you how to use the specific IDE and their features.

(They reused the Eclipse strategy of tweaking a base IDE to fit each use case: general web - WebStorm, PHP - PHPStorm, Java - IntelliJ, Android - Android Studio, Python - PyCharm, Ruby - RubyMine...)

Eclipse is kind of the king of free. Even IBM started with Eclipse and made changes to get their proprietary Rapid Application Developer (RAD) IDE. The IDE IBM recommends and distributes started out as the Eclipse IDE source code. For what that is worth.

StrathOscar,"I guess the main problem I have with initiatives such as this is that I am not convinced they do more good than harm.

If we break down health into a psychological and physical category, I think it can generally be agreed on that desk jobs are not unique, and as such there are good resources available out there. Creating a discord server to that end would be akin to reinventing the wheel.

In terms of psychological health, I think a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing. If your formal training is in the field of informatics, that doesn't make you qualified to diagnose and/or endorse any forms of treatments to your colleagues. In fact, creating an unsupervised forum which encourages people to talk about anxiety, isolation, ideation of suicide etc. might be exacerbating/normalizing the problems, not improving them. How could anyone who is not formally trained in the field of psychological health make claims about the efficacy of treatments with any degree of certainty?

This trend of non-professionals coming up with the solutions to mental health has the potential to be very dangerous. Maybe it genuinely does good, but why take the risk in the first place? Redefining the channels for mental health problems is a risky endeavor. If you acknowledge the risk and don't purport to make any claims to genuinely improve wellbeing, that is fine. Just make it explicitly clear to anyone who joins your channel that you aren't in a position to deal with health issues and that there are other channels out there for precisely that.

thedomham,"Creating one DAO per table is pretty much standard procedure, so that might be a good starting point.

There really is a lot going on in that code. The most important thing to start with is that you should be very aware of the fact that you are an intern: your instinct will probably be to apply all the best practices you know to the code and transform that giant pile of garbage into the well structured clean code it deserves to be.

The problem is that for one the rest of the team will have to work with your code when you are gone. You might also piss people off, especially the person who wrote the code. Team members that use the code may also be pissed, just because people tend to dislike change. A good indicator for people disliking change is a huge part of the code being a historically grown zoo of bad practices. So to summarize: you mean well, your code may be objectively better, but you might still suffer negative repercussions. I don't want to deter you, but you should keep that in mind.

Other than that, 

- the logging-helper looks over the top complicated

- the method names are confusing (storeXToDelete instead of deleteX or XDAO.delete(x))

- all the classes you describe seem way too big (god classes), which is quite interesting because a god class usually does too many distinct things at the same time. Your classes actually only do one thing, but for many different domains

- the SQL-query file is a weird design choice. Where is the advantage? Why is it a single file?

- I obviously have no idea of your database structure, performance requirements and existing queries, but there are tools that use code generation or reflection so that you don't have to write all the SQL statements yourself. If you want to, you can also automate the creation of objects from DB-entries

- if you have a DB-heavy application, you will probably have to touch like half the classes in the project. That's quite the *shotgun surgery*. So try to do that change exactly once

- implement once DAO and test it thoroughly. Make sure that it works in the real system, that your coworkers are okay with that change and then apply it to all the other tables

beowulf_71,"Couple questions.  As I replied elsewhere I can see a use for this library. 

First.. 9 billion a day? Can you elaborate in terms of how many servers you have deployed to handle this many? I recall years ago working on a similar product that was lucky to do 10 to 15 transactions a minute which was more than just a transform, but similar. I assume you must have this in the cloud and auto scaling and stateless servers, etc.. but even so..  at 9 billion a day, that is 104,000 per second.. and I would assume you are not running consistently at that speed so at some point it is potentially a lot more in a second.  I would be very curious as to the server/hardware setup to make this possible?

Second.. just curious on this.. but Scala which is a not often sought after language (yes I know it has a following, but latest polls indicate it is less than 1% of languages/deployments.. which points to it being more a niche choice than one sought after by most jobs/organizations). Why not look at writing this in Go, that builds binaries for every platform and supposedly (though not sure on this) is quite a bit faster runtime?  I am a big Java guy myself, but as I dig in to Go more, things like this.. e.g. clis, services that do things like transform json (which go is built around btw..e.g. has insanely good json support), seem like it would be a better choice.. as it would run native on platforms and be easier to avoid JVMs and such. I may be wrong on this.. and not saying its a bad choice, but just curious the reasoning behind using Scala vs something like Go or even C?

Overall very impressed with what this does. ",1529944686.0

I had no idea why JSP wasn't even considered as it was a standard. The XSLT template engine was basically served in a servlet container (tomcat) so it was even weirder why JSP was not chosen. My speculation could be that there was a rockstar UI SDE there. He developed this stuff and the only go-to person to solve any issue related to the XSLT framework. Needless to say, it was difficult to hire and bring new SDEs up to speed in the company.

Northeastpaw,"I posted this in response to a similar question awhile ago:

So I'm a Java developer who went the other way to C# for a time. Here are some notable differences:

1. No properties. Getters and setters have to be coded yourself or generated by an IDE (or hacked in via some black magic called [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)).
2. No reference types. Everything in Java is passed by value. However, even though object references are passed by value, the passed in references will still point at the correct object so things work pretty transparently. You can't swap references in a method and see that reflected back in the calling method but that's a very niche use case anyway.
3. No out parameters. I never understood the use for them anyway.
4. Huge ecosystem. Coming from Java to C# it felt like there was a dearth of high quality C# libraries and frameworks. The amount of really good stuff in Java can feel overwhelming, but that's complaining about being spoiled.

You will definitely want to bookmark the [standard library javadocs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/). Find out what frameworks and libraries the team you're moving to and bookmark the reference documentation for all of them.

Common equivalents for C# frameworks/libraries/tools:

1. Entity framework -> JPA. Hibernate is the most common JPA implementation but there's also EclipseLink, OpenJPA, DataNucleus. Raw DB access is done through JDBC.
2. Visual Studio -> Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans. There's a lot of love for IntelliJ. Eclipse is really entrenched and has a lot of plugins for common frameworks. I personally prefer Eclipse but IntelliJ is very cool.
3. MSBuild/NuGet -> Maven or Gradle. Both handle dependency resolution and pull dependencies from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/). Maven builds are written in XML and are very declarative; if you find yourself struggling with a complex Maven build then you're not thinking declaratively enough. Gradle has declarative elements but allows you to script parts of your build. Gradle has been adopted by Android as its build system so if you're working with Android, learn Gradle.
4. IIS -> Apache Tomcat, Wildfly, many others. Java application servers package lots of enterprise components like messaging, transactions, and dependency injection with a web container. Note that Apache Tomcat is just a servlet container which means it handles the web part but doesn't provide any of the rest. Tomcat is often paired with another framework called Spring which can provide those enterprise features, albeit in a slightly different way than JavaEE.

Java has more libraries, runs in more platforms that lack .NET support that embedded devices, SIM, mainframes, phones (even if it isn't proper Java), enjoys GUI frameworks across multiple OS as part of the SDK.

As downsides, up to Graal all good AOT compilers were commercial, prefers to adopt only proven practices, values backward compatibility above all, lacks value types and support for low level coding, prefers conventions over syntactic sugar.

.NET rules on Windows, not so much outside of it, specially regarding available libraries.

The GUI story for .NET Core still is a kind of WIP. There are Xamarin.Forms, Avalonia, Eto, but they all lack the maturity and third party components that Swing and JavaFX have available.

Of course on Windows, .NET GUIs rule vs the Java ones.

C# has lots of nice syntic sugar features, proper value types and generics, the always supported AOT/JIT since the beginning and much better features for low level programming, specially since 7.x.

Also we cannot look at Java and .NET in isolation, we also need to take into consideration the alternative languages on each platform. Koltin, Scala, Clojure on one side and F# on the .NET side.

Personally, I cannot decide between both, hence why always tend continuous alternate between both, some times even on the same project (GUI in WPF, backend in Spring).

On the other hand, some Java stuff like enums are amazing and far superior to any other language. Spring is an essential piece and brings so much to enterprise Java that to work without it would be foolish.

fishy_water,"I am a .NET developer who worked with Java / eclipselink during 2015/2016. I had a fairly challenging time building a library stack. With .NET, Microsoft provides the default stack and it just kind of works. You add stuff to it. A java stack is more complex and if you want to use certain libraries, you may have to downgrade. And that is where the challenges start. The stack can be brittle and send you down the rabbit hole researching for a day.

Eclipse and Eclipselink were extremely buggy. I had to click through every tree of my database in Eclipse in order to see columns created when refreshing models from the db! Haha.

I missed having partial classes in .NET which are extremely handy for working with scaffolded stuff (which Eclipse can do). In .NET, you can regenerate your model classes from the DB and still have your additional annotations unimpeded in separate files. Not so with java. I can't remember how I got around that - maybe using a layer of inheritance.

I'm planning to do a new project using java / spring and I am dreading the stack building. Maven was very buggy at the time as well and Nuget just works. I am using java for server licensing reasons this time and because it is a popular tech with a solid community, performs well and provides an eerily similar experience to c#.

sandor_nemeth,"AFAIK (and according to docs) the 1st argument is only true when you  are using AOP (because AOP uses proxies). If you have singleton beans, no proxy is created.

Also I would ask the question if you really have that significant hit on performance (or run into serious problems when using AOP) that you'll need to be optimize this away? So is this (supposedly) positive effect overwrites - in terms of business value addition - the value that more readable and maintainable code represents?

Also, thoughts on the other points:

* 2: see point 1, do we really need to optimize this away? In that case I'd ask the question if it would make sense to drop spring entirely (spring is pretty heavy in terms of performance hit) 
* 3: the last time I've seen this as a best practice was when EJBs were the style of the day ... 
* 4: I think descriptive naming of the class and the outline view of any IDE can mitigate this
* 5: not even sure why this is a reason. 

Personally I think it is bad practice to put interfaces everywhere, when there will be exactly **one** implementation. There is no reason for that interface to exist there. Some bulletpoints as thoughts:

* changing anything is just more work (not more complicated, not less complicated, just simply more work)
* makes the code much harder to navigate - every time when I navigate a codebase like this, I always get first to the interface, from where I'll have to navigate to the implementation
* doesn't improve readability (would be the same if there would be only the class)",1529505223.0
cryptos6,"An interface should abstract over something. If the interface just repeats the _interface_ of the class, than nothing is won. It could be even worse: you create an uninspired interface because you have to that gets reused later for another implementation, but doesn't really fit because you didn't take the time to design it properly in the first place. 

Interfaces that are no abstractions with just a single implementation are a big code smell. They make it harder to navigate in the code, they mess your code up with unnecessary artifacts, and they simply add no value. 

I would avoid interfaces to circumvent technical limitations.

And never forget: Every class _has_ already an interface!",1530098528.0
m_takeshi,"My 2 cents (as an advocate for interfaces): 

\- interfaces makes it easier to reason about how classes interact with each other. You can write the specs of some class before thinking about how to implement them - and if you stick to your definition, the implementation almost doesn't matter 

\- its easier to write tests for interfaces first. IMO, its hard to write a bunch of tests that just fails to compile. Its really kind of the same point as 1. They also make it easier on mocking libraries to write tests.

\- interfaces that have only 1 implementation (or 2 at most)  incur a minimal performance hit under most modern jdks, so performance is a non issue (barring some extreme cases)

\- as a con, interfaces can also add another layer of indirection to reason about the code, if you don't completely trust the implementation

All in all, I heavily favor of overusing interfaces and I 'contaminated' a lot of my colleagues ",1529517129.0

gandaroth,"Programming to an interface is a good idea and good practice if you actually do have multiple implementations that could be used in place of the interface. But, I find it requires having multiple implementations in the first place to understand the correct abstraction to write as an interface to those implementations. Day-to-day, I don't find the need that often to have more than one implementation, and at that point interfaces become noise that change too frequently with implementation details because they do not have the correct abstraction on the implementation due to a lack of information on what commonalities exist between multiple implementations.

Bolitho,"I have the strong feeling lots of commenters here interpret the principle *""programming to an interface""* in a *technical* way, instead of the meaning of *interface* from a conceptual pov as a *contract* - which is the correct interpretation of that advice imho!

A concrete class could of course be an interface - it simply depends on the use case. The same is true for things like abstract classes.

In languages that support duck typing at runtime the *interface* hasn't even a real language component to *expose* it. But of course the basic principle stays the same!

To Java 10 only programming change is local variable type inference, you can use 'var' instead a type of your object when you declare it.
the 'var' usage only works on local scope and the compiler need to know the type of the var in compilation time, you cannot declare thinks like:

solinvictus21,"Streams don’t handle checked exceptions because they’re based on a functional programming model while Java was originally designed as an imperative language. In a hypothetically pure FP model, no data ever “returns” and no errors ever propagate back to the caller. All processing and data only ever moves forward toward the end of the call chain(s).

As such, streams are an attempt to shoehorn FP into an imperative language, and the concept of checked exceptions just doesn’t fit because of the design implication built into them that it’s the caller’s problem to deal with it. I’d never expect checked exceptions to be handled well in Java streams without some pretty significant language design changes that will never happen.",1529078594.0
oparisy,"In my daily practice this is rarely a problem. I elected a long time ago to (almost) never add ""throws"" clauses to my methods signatures.

It does not mean that I never throw exceptions. Quite the opposite! But I only throw unchecked ones.

Should I call a checked exception throwing method from my code, I'll handle it locally if it makes sense or (most of the time) wrap it in an unchecked exception and rethrow it.

As a measure of safety I'll usually have some top-level try/catch in my apps, with at least a logger to react to unhandled exceptions reaching it.

A consequence of that style of coding is that I rarely have issues using my methods from streams.

Note also that unchecked exceptions ""pass through"" streams, so you still get meaningful (if verbose!) stack traces and the expected behavior (the iteration is halted).",1529087233.0

beowulf_71,"You all need to keep in mind how many 10s of thousands of java developers there are.. I think over a million world wide now isnt it.. or maybe even more?  I have worked with many developers from various parts of the world and it is truly sad/unfortunate how many fall into the category of being drones.. not able to think on their own, outside the box, solve issues, etc. I will say for most of them, it is not their fault. It is truly bad management style.. they expect developers to just churn out code and get it done and who cares if its not proper use of exceptions, etc. 

Case in point.. Java classpath hell and the NoClassDefFoundException.. and its siblings. The biggest reason this happens.. java developers.. most of them.. have no clue how the classpath within the JVM works.. e.g. how Java classloaders look for and resolve classes, in what order, etc. So.. what happens..  they just use whatever library they need based on SO solutions without a thought as to any potential clash of the same library, different versions being used in their code base. Case in point.. I have seen developers build SDKs for others to use and just pull in tons of dependencies without considering that the SDK has to work in ANOTHER application that has dependencies... so what happens.. you either get NoClassDefFoundException, or more likely, due to the same library, different versions, being in the same app classpath.. the SDK stops working because it found the class of a dependency in the main app classpath.. only its a different version.. and the method it is looking to use doesnt exist, or has different signature, etc.. so now you get one of the exceptions about method not found, or method signature issues.. and developers.. who just arbitrarily add dependencies, that dont know much if anything about jvm/classpath/classloaders.. scratch their heads wondering what the hell happened. It ends up wasting hours/days/weeks sometimes of productivity.. all because of the huge lack of understanding of one of the most critical parts of Java.

I go out of my way to build SDKs with as little if any dependencies purely because I know exactly what will happen if someone takes my SDK into their app and it has dependency clashes. Either my SDK doesnt work right..in which case I get floods of emails/issues/etc saying something doesnt work.. and you know what sucks about that.. there is no way for me to determine that the issue is possibly because they use a dependency that clashes with one I used. Or.. their app stops working because the dependency in my SDK is found first and breaking other libraries they use.. or their own code.

The sad thing is, I dont see a good way to solve this issue. If day 1 every aspect of Java tutorials made it one of the most important things to learn and understand.. I think we would be in a much better place today with this issue, which I would argue is one of the hardest to track down and is one of the biggest problems that occurs... especially since the dawn of tools like Maven and Gradle that just pull in dependency after dependency for you without you having any idea what other libraries a dependency depends on. Sure..you can deep dive on it.. but who does? Only time anyone truly figures out that their app is using 2 (or more) versions of the same library.. is when they get hit by one of these classpath issues.

How many of you actually know how many libraries your application uses? Spring aside.. when you pull in a dependency... do you actually dig in to see what other libraries that dependency uses? Are you aware of any of your dependencies using libraries that Spring itself uses? I am guessing most do not have a clue.. and if they havent been hit yet with a runtime classpath issue, its been blind luck... not because they understood class loading resolution and realize that all of the dependencies they pull in dont clash with one another in any way.",1529091585.0

It’s also useful if you use the Provider pattern to supply an alternative interface, such as writing a remote server to communicate to a SmartCard via an alternative method such as OTA. 

This is a big part of how telecommunication networks manage SIM cards, and how banking providers remotely manage payment cards. 

It’s abstracts compliant ISO-7816 protocols, which is a big time saver. I think it’s niche, but given there’s a lot of reasons to use a SmartCard in more secure compute environments it’s still quite useful in the base JDK/JRE. ",1529082237.0

I wonder.. if today when API is so synonymous with REST and 3rd party integration via http/rest calls, if it might be time to either coin a more specific name that represents SDK API, or if when referring to an API that is wrapped in an SDK and not a micro-service API, it should be specifically declared as such?

Not trying to cause any sort of chaos or piss anyone off... I am just eluding to the fact that today the use of API is used in a lot of similar yet different contexts, and while underneath they still mean the same (or similar) thing, I am sure I am not the only one who gets confused (even for a short while) when the use of API is referring to an SDK API.

I think you are confusing a full programming language ( Java ) with scripting languages like Python, where there are commands you can run like shell ( operating system, ie windows, dos, linux ) commands.

Java doesn't work like that.

If you want to learn Java make sure you have the JDK installed on your computer.  That, a shell command console, and a text editor ( Notepad on Windows ) is all you need to start.

Go to the Oracle site, follow their tutorial, then go to Amazon and get a highly rated Java book for beginners.   Avoid ""learn Java fast"" titles, you will get a shitty education.   Java is one of those things where you take time to learn it right and get a big payoff.

Sipkab,"In my opinion:

There might be a few valid use cases for this, however that would require proper documentation. The example you provided doesn't seem to be one of them.

In general, an abstract class is mostly used to extract common functionality/properties from the subclasses.

By making a class abstract with no actual abstract methods can signal the developer that using this class directly, without extending any of the methods from the superclass, is not the recommended use case.

Having no methods at all, might mean that the class should be used as a marker superclass (like Serializable). Without further looking into your example, I can't say what it actually does. For me, it would be better to declare Transformer as an interface rather than an abstract class.

Having no declared methods might mean that some reflection based framework would use this class, based on the methods you actually write yourself. Like writing some transform() methods with some arguments, and the framework would choose an appropriate one to call based on the arguments.

But the again, without proper documentation, its hard to say.

I suppose that this class was inserted as an ""extension point"" for shared functionality. Extending from an abstract class has one big advantage over implementing an interface: It allows you to add functionality to a set of subclasses without having to change the subclasses.

However, just adding an empty abstract class really doesn't make much sense:
1. you can always (or often) insert such a class at a later point of time (if you control all existing subclasses)
2. usually the functionality on an abstract class has to do with state held there or as (empty) strategies that are called from other methods on the abstract class

Now we're experimenting with skipping the war step for local builds and adding a `./gradlew project:fast` option that copies everything to our tomcat location and bounces the tomcat server.  That's another 15\-20 seconds per build saved.

Now a full build has gone from \~2 \- 3 minutes (or longer for older machines) to about 1 \- 1:15 in build time. If we skip the war step for subsequent builds that's 40\-45 seconds per build.  Take in the incremental build portion and if your scope of work was limited to just JS or Java, then 20\-25 seconds tops.  Depending on the breaks.

>Do you want an npm like experience for Java?

As others have already said, definitely not.  With `groupId`, etc. it makes it near impossible for collisions of names and the the process to have a library removed is extremely difficult.  Basically if NPM had followed an already established model, the `leftpad` fiasco would never have happened because Kik wouldn't have thrown their weight around because they would be identified by their `groupId`.  That and `leftpad` wouldn't have been able to be deleted in protest.

The other big misstep of Node / NPM is not having a single global `node_modules` location.  I have \~10\-15 gigs of `node_modules` on my machine from various projects.  M`y .grad`le `/ .`m2 directories are 3 gigs in comparison.

Adding libs command line could probably be done with a plugin. But to make that useful, [mvnrepository.com](https://mvnrepository.com) would have to have those options available like npm does.  But as it is adding one line to the dependencies in `build.gradle` file is just as fast.

I think the syntax is good enough and no need to bog it down with JSON or worry about yaml and indentation.  The Groovy syntax takes a bit of getting used to, but outside of unfamiliarity it is not that bad.

Gradle runs tasks just as well as Gulp or Grunt but faster and in parallel when you allow it to \- so some of our newer build scripts is just calling Grunt as Grunt still has its place for some of our front end stuff.

* A real language with a real grammar. Only developers write compilation processes anyway, why waste time with a verbose declaratory file format like XML, YAML or JSON. Those are less flexible and more prone to errors and end up wasting our time a lot.

* Make it compiled and kick the interpreted language habit out. Every build system I've ever touched is somewhat interpreted. I want to have good IDE support, which means indexing, auto-completion and advanced analysis tools. Opening a gradle file in Idea to me is still painful. It's wrong in many cases and it's completely slow on auto-completing anything.

* No VM required to run the build. Get the compiled byte code to a stripped down runtime just like an interpreter would, but you interpret the byte code not the language

* The grammar needs to be simple, clean and concise without excess. I don't care for lambda functions in a build file, it makes the exercise of maintaining too freaking long, specially when you have devs who think they're artists and need to have pretty code everywhere.

* I'm fine with the way Maven dependencies work. What I don't want is to see blocker hell where a project can't even be built because the dependency system is ""trying to help you"". In other words no feature enabled by default.

After that, with each subsequent REST API call, the server returns the next CSRF token through the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header, which Angular includes in the next request. I believe there is already an Angular module which implements this pattern.

Note, this pattern introduces state to your API requests, because the server has to correlate the CSRF token provided by the UI with the token stored on the server. For what you want to, I don't think you can avoid this.

Also, you'll have to sequence your REST API calls correctly, so that the client and the server don't get out of sync.",1528586877.0

So, does it solve this problem? That depends on your point of view. As mentioned later in this thread, you'll still need another tool (Maven/Gradle) to prevent this situation from arising.

If you really need multiple versions of the same library, OSGi has got you covered, as well as the Java module system with its ability to have multiple ModuleLayers, each containing their own version of a given module.

natnath,"Basically you want to do `Integration-Testing` as well as `Unit-Testing`.

You can start the Spring Boot app(or usual Spring app) in a [JUnit runner](https://github.com/authorjapps/spring-boot-integration-test#what-does-the-above-runwith-do), then start firing the tests via JUnit against this app(tomcat/jetty).

But you can go one step further to make/declare them via JSON, so that you can assert the entire response `as it is` keeping the object/JSON structure intact(using [Zerocode lib](https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode)), **without** the need of doing repeated `assertThat(""actual-field1"", is(expected-field1))`.

Instead of something like below,

~~HttpResponse<User> response = aHttpClient.get(""https://<host_post_externalized>/users/octocat"")~~
  ~~.header(""accept"", ""application/json"")~~
  ~~.execute();~~

~~User user = response.getUser();~~

~~assertThat(response.getStatusCode(), is(200))~~

~~assertThat(user.getId(), is(33847731))~~

~~assertThat(user.getLogin(), is(""octocat""))~~

~~assertThat(user.getType(), is(""user""))~~

you just need do this way and keep on adding `steps` for your subsequent `user journey` -
```javaScript
{
    ""scenarioName"": ""Invoke the GET api and assert the response"",
    ""steps"": [
        {
            ""name"": ""get_user_details"",
            ""url"": ""https://<host_post_externalized>/users/octocat"",
            ""operation"": ""GET"",
            ""assertions"": {
                ""status"": 200,
                ""body"": {
                    ""login"" : ""octocat"",
                    ""id"" : 33847731,
                    ""type"" : ""User""

pfirmsto,"Ok, so I took some time out and had a look at the implementation in OpenJDK, while it's probably the most up to date implementation, it's mostly written in C\+\+, so needs to be compiled for each platform.  I didn't try to determine how much it depends on internal JVM api code.

I also looked at Apache Harmony's implementation and was pleasantly surprised, it's written in java, it's modular, and its only dependency is the well regarded asm bytecode library.   It will be a lot easier to maintain.  It's a little out of date, designed for Java 6 bytecode, but I think it's well worth getting up to date if we want to provide long term support.

I've copied the module from SVN and converted it to Maven and it's already building and tests are passing.

I think we should also look at implementing a Pack200InputStream.

Oh, it was already an OSGi bundle too, so really easy to check dependencies.

Slanec,"While I do agree, there is a problem with the better approach - it requires a set-up database while building the software.

Suddenly it's harder to still have a one-click-build procedure because your build needs to locally start an embedded DB, set it up, run migrations on it, and only then you're able to generate jOOQ code.

Not impossible, we've actually done this. But it required me to fork and partially rewrite an existing Maven plugin for running an embedded Postgres.

Ideally you'd be able to generate the jOOQ code directly from the SQL DDL to avoid having to start, set up and kill the DB during the build process. And that, dear Watson, is still near impossible in 2018 and jOOQ 3.10.",1528304352.0

beowulf_71,"I find this fascinating.. as someone who preaches API first using RAML (or OpenAPI if forced to go this painful route), I find it better to design the models that essentially mimic (more or less) the DB table design in a way that allows you to use the generated code for DTOs and DAOs. 

For example, and this is tied to Java but should work in some manner with most languages...  We define a JSON Schema (or if you are lucky enough to use RAML 1, a RAML Type.. so much nicer than json schema) that models the data we plan to work with. The generator creates a simple java pojo. That pojo is used in the jaxrs resource layer to auto-convert incoming json payloads to java objects. By using the same pojo as the underlying entity bean model and method delegation from entity methods to the pojo methods, we can pass the incoming pojo from the resource layer directly to the service layer where it is wrapped by an entity bean and can be stored/retrieved from db. 

In this way, we are able to design the API and models, and reuse those models as the underlying DB structure. 

Now.. we ALSO use Flyway scripts.. though we currently hand craft those to match the json schema/raml type pojo generated type used by the entity bean. It wouldnt be hard to generate flyway scripts (at least for creating a db with) with some form of json schema to flyway generator. 

If we were to do everything db first, we may still be able to model the json schema correctly so that may still work. I typically find that as an API first design you determine the data structures you need from the API design though.

realfrankaroo,"I'm not convinced it's the best solution to the problem. The issue to me seems like container like classes should always define their contained types in the class definition as generic parameter. For example, the Group class in the article could be rewritten as:

    interface Item {
      String name();
    }
    
    interface Group<T extends Item> {
      Group<T> buildFrom(List<T> list);
      
      List<T> items();
    
      default Group<T> filterBy(Predicate<? super T> predicate) {
        return buildFrom(items().stream().filter(predicate).collect(Collectors.toList()));
      }
    }

With this definition, the extension to sub\-classes that specialise the contained type is trivial \(I'm skipping the complete implementation for brevity\):

    interface ScoredItem extends Item {
      int score();
    }
    
    class ScoredGroup implements Group<ScoredItem> {
      public ScoredGroup(List<ScoredItem> items) {
        ...
      }
    
      @Override
      public Group<ScoredItem> buildFrom(List<ScoredItem> list) {
        return new ScoredGroup(list);
      }
    
      @Override
      public List<ScoredItem> items() {
        ...
      }
    }

and

    interface ScoreExplanatoryItem extends ScoredItem {
      String explanation();
    }
    
    class ScoreExplainatoryGroup implements Group<ScoreExplanatoryItem> {
    
      public ScoreExplanatoryGroup(List<ScoreExplanatoryItem> items) {
        ...
      }
    
      @Override
      public Group<ScoreExplanatoryItem> buildFrom(List<ScoreExplanatoryItem> list) {
        return new ScoreExplanatoryGroup(list);
      }
    
      @Override
      public List<ScoreExplanatoryItem> items() {
        ...
      }
    }

finally, using the interfaces becomes a breeze with the contravariant filterBy:

    class Main {
      public static void main(String[] argv) {
        Group<ScoredItem> sg= new ScoredGroup(new ArrayList<>());
        Predicate<Item> predOnItems = (p) -> p.name().isEmpty();
        Predicate<ScoredItem> predOnScored = (p) -> p.score() ==0;
        Group<ScoredItem> sg1 = sg.filterBy(predOnItems);
        Group<ScoredItem> sg2 = sg.filterBy(predOnScored);
        Group<ScoreExplanatoryItem> seg = new ScoreExplanatoryGroup(new ArrayList<>());
        Group<ScoreExplanatoryItem> seg1 = seg.filterBy(predOnItems);
        Group<ScoreExplanatoryItem> seg2 = seg.filterBy(predOnScored);
        Group<ScoreExplanatoryItem> seg3 = seg.filterBy((p) ->p.explanation().isEmpty());

Once they got their shit together though, it seemed to me there was even better community engagement than what we'd seen with Sun.

IIRC - and please do keep in mind this is my recollection with no documentation to reference - there was a lot of shouting across orgs as to personal branding vs Oracle branding, especially wrt community work. I believe most folks landed in a safe spot, with little static. But some orgs (esp customer-facing) wanted to force big O branding, and created a fair amount of community churn because of it. It definitely furthered the Java community’s distrust of Oracle as Java steward, and, I think, contributed to the rift we still see today. 

To conclude my gossip, I have ex-Oracle friends today across the global Java network who have given up their Java Champion status and eschew J1 (OracleCode?) and all O-related events. There’s definitely some bad blood.

You then have another class Child which extends Parent, and declares method foo, with no argument, and different implementation. 

If I'm understanding correctly, if method foo is declared protected/public, then Child.foo automatically overrides Parent.foo. Parent.bar will thus invoke Child.foo. 

But I'm guessing the above behavior does not happen, if foo is declared private. In that case, the override does not happen, and Parent.bar will always invokes Parent.foo. 

Which seems scary to some extent. I would expect that if I have a class method which is private, and I change it to package-private (eg, to enable testing) without making any other changes, program behavior would remain the same.

\- Matchmaking server functionality, API for the server

\- Rating system for the players

\- Servers storing replays, maps and mods, and APIs for all this stuff

\- Authorization and indentification of users, steam account linking

\- Java Desktop application with JavaFX as the lobby for the players, which uses all the different server APIs to implement all its functionality

\- Chat system for all players \(\>1000 usually online\) with bridges to Discord, IRC etc.

\- Map generation and meta\-game\-mode\-servers, which need to commmunicate with matchmaking server

\- Proxying/Imrpoving the peer\-to\-peer connection the game uses

\- Web page for FAF, web\-based unit database, wikis, and of course the forum.

A lot of Java \(both on server & client\) and Python \(old server & client, currently getting replaced by Java\), some C\+\+, and assembly if you really want you try to dig into the actual game binary. And of course web stuff and SQL/database stuff.

bwainwright,"I issue/assess Java coding tests for my company during recruitment, couple of things:

1. A coding test is usually used to generally assess your approach to problem solving. While it certainly won't hurt, they're not necessarily looking for 'textbook' code.
2. That said, clear coding style \- ie, descriptive and meaningful variable and function/method names, and well structured code \(ie, appropriate use of methods/loops/if statements/etc\).
3. Personally, I'm not looking for comments on every line, especially if your code is clear enough. However, a couple of comments over key areas of logic is certainly welcomed, especially if you're not entirely confident in your actual code. Confusing code with zero comments will score negatively with me though, so if in doubt, comment!
4. Consider writing unit tests \- I'll give bonus points for code with good test coverage.
5. KISS \- Keep It Simple Stupid!! There is absolutely no need to over complicate matters! Just implement the simplest solution to the problem you're given. As much as we talk about 'rock star coders', companies are looking for reliable developers who write *solid* code, and can also deliver to a deadline. You can show your rock star abilities once you've got the job! 
6. If appropriate for the solution, use good OOP/D principals such as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. However, *do not overcomplicate the solution!*

There's probably a bunch more other can add, but these would be up there for any coding test that came to me to assess. Again, remember, the coding test is just an assessment of your practical coding ability to ensure you meet a technical minimum. You're unlikely to be 'competing' against others, so don't overthink or stress about it.

Good luck...",1527697471.0
JourneymanGM,"# Consider a question that can only be answered by referring to never-before-seen Javadoc

One of the best questions I've used on an exam I wrote was where they were given method signatures and asked to refer to Javadoc that was invented just for that question to understand why an API error had occurred. In other words, they aren't asked to find a syntax error in code, but rather to figure out why an API is being misused. The question was something like this:

>Here at Spacely Sprockets, we build widgets. One of the important tasks we do is calculating our widget production rate. Say that we have the following code:

    public double calculateWidgetProductionRate(Integer machineId, LocalDate date) {
    
        Machine machine = this.getMachine(machineId);
    
        Integer widgetsProduced = machine.getWidgetsProduced(date);
    
        LocalTime startTime = machine.getWidgetProductionStart(date);
    
        LocalTime endTime = machine.getWidgetProductionEnd(date);
    
        return calculateAverageWidgesPerHour(widgetsProduced, startTime, endTime);
    
    }

>When we run `calculateWidgetProductionRate(12345)`, we get back a reasonable result. When we run `calculateWidgetProductionRate(1)`, we get an `IllegalArgumentException` on line 2. When we run `calculateWidgetProductionRate(23456)`, we get an `UnsupportedOperationException` on line 6.  
>  
>We have reason to believe that the code above, and the methods referenced within, are without error and that the issue is in a misuse of an API. Referring to the Javadocs to the right of this question, explain at a high level why we are getting the error. Additionally, explain at a high level how these problems might be fixed.

And then in the Javadocs, you would see something documented like `getMachine()` throws `IllegalArgumentException` if it is not a 5\-digit id, and `calculateAverageWidgetsPerHour()` throws an` UnsupportedOperationExceptio`n if the machine was offline that day. The Javaod would also include methods for things like checking if a machine was online. A good answer would explain why the code violated a contract with the API and how it would be fixed \(e.g. ""We were trying to calculate averages for machine that was offline that day, and the API throws that error in response if you try that. There's a method that checks if it was online that day, so we should call that first to verify.""\) There would also be other methods in the Javadoc that didn't do anything relevant to the question \(e.g. returning other statistics about the machine\).

I've had devs who have aced the fizzbuzz and algorithm question only to bomb *hard* at this question \(like spending half an hour and ending up with ""I think that `getMachine()` isn't implemented right."" In other words, they have no idea how to solve problems by reading the documentation, meaning that they wouldn't be able to solve most of the day to day problems.

I probably spent like 30 hours constructing the question, making a dummy project and writing Javadoc for it so that I could generate the HTML reports, and going through several rounds of testing to make sure everything was clear and well\-worded. But every person who has taken it, even those who found it difficult, thought it was a really good question, and it has become our best predictor of success as a Java developer.",1527712506.0

Azzk1kr,"This application is the incarnation of an idea I've had for some time. At work I'm frequently investigating incidents and the like in legacy applications. There's not really a administrator interface or something, except for access to the databases. I found out that the most frequent things I used to do was:

1. Construct an initial query \(a starting point based on some basic data\)
2. Construct another query based on output from the previous one
3. Construct another query based on output from the previous one
4. etc...

The data is structured in such a way that using only joins can be a bit tedious to 'navigate' through. Especially with 1:N:1:M:K relationships. To make things easier, I decided to make a drill down application, which is in fact a sort of lazy query evaluator. It basically boils down to this: you define queries where the input is given from the output of the previous query.

For more details, and if you'd like to test it \(please do\), consult the `README.md`. I'm not sure if everything is clear, but I'd like to hear some constructive criticism. And of course, hoping it's useful for others.

rngisforfailures,"Look at the package structure to see how well the code is separated. Are there different layers like: dao/repository, dto/model, logic/service, controller, exception, validation, util?

How many lines of code for each file? If the average is about 150, that's really deconstructed. If you see multiple files with over 1,000 lines each, that's getting scary, especially if it's not in the model/dto package.

Check the unit tests in src/test/java and see how many assert statements like assertTrue(...)/assertFalse(...) they have. If they simply check that the code executes without exception, that's not very good. The best I've seen are more like integration tests that explain each business use case, e.g. if an order has more than five items, calculate some kind of discount, or if this is the person's first order, add them to a list to mail a free product catalog.

The next couple are kind of related, and indicate the type of programming you see in Spring. 
Does the application code against interfaces? Interfaces are generally good, especially when they specify a meaningful amount of work, e.g. if a RestApi interface has methods create(...), read(...), update(...), and delete(...). 

How configurable are the objects? Do they instantiate objects by calling constructors using the new keyword in the code, which is limiting, or do they have dependency injection where you pass in a previously constructed object.

Also check for ""static"" classes with private constructors where you cannot instantiate an instance, and they only have static methods, or a singleton/multiton design pattern that have static constructors. This can also be a limitiation, although acceptable when used with discretion, e.g. classes in the util package have only static methods.

Numsuccles,"1 - You are being given a hospital pass. You aren't Java devs and you don't have a clear requirement. You need to go back and solve this first with management - in all honesty you will need a miracle to do even a passable job - you need a contractor or skilled Java hire. The management must have a plan B for when the contractor realises what you are doing and potentially plays hardball. Running the tools mentioned by other posters is a great start but how will you even interpret the results and what will you compare them to? This is not to doubt your capability but to point out that what may seem like a small job is in fact a highly skilled, often tedious and very difficult endeavor.

2 - You have a bespoke product on your hand. I would suggest you need to do the following analysis and even then a big project will still be difficult to pin down:

* What is this hosted on (what server does it run on and was it developed on)? Does anyone know how to configure this?
* How many lines of code do you have? How big is this beast? is it an enterprise project or something small?
* What IDE is this developed with? There are lots of hidden parts to projects like workspace metadata that may be critical to maintaining the project. Working backwards to create projects from pure source files to try and recreate whatever arcane project structure and build magic he uses could be a disaster.
* What version of Java is used and how many J2EE specifications http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/index.html does the website use ( for example a typical legacy enterprise web project may use Jave Server Pages, Expression Language, Annotations, Bean Validation etc.)?
* Can anyone understand how to set the various logging levels and interpret the resulting log files?
* How many third party jar files are used in the build and at what version (you may have some out of date - no longer downloadable and certainly scary from a security point of view dependencies)?
* What frameworks are used to implement the MVC framework (does it even use an MVC pattern?)?
* Does anyone understand or have a working knowledge of those frameworks? 
* Is the code well commented (well commented means that you can understand it - it is very rare to find well commented code even with well funded frameworks, its a very tough skill)?
* Has he provided any support documentation, does he have design documents, do you have all the relevant passwords and crucially do you own any stored data and have backups?
* Are there any tests? Do those tests come in the following flavours - unit (low level, method by method), system (often ones that exercise several architectural layers including database access) and finally are there some high level black box automated tests (for example selenium tests that simulates a user clicking and entering data on a webpage.)
* Do you own the source code or do you just get the final product from your contractor? If you don't have the source you are in big trouble.
* Do you own the assets for the site (images and so on)? 
* What is the cost of this site being offline? If the contractor is frozen out and then you get stuck it can take a long time to get things working again. 

The best and safest thing you (the company!) can possibly do is reassure the original contractor by having a frank and open discussion - possibly offering a maintenance retainer if the site is valuable - and ask the contractor to include current staff in the ongoing maintenance. Add an element of paid knowledge transfer. What management needs is to solve the risky relationship they have with this single point of failure - your contractor - and not be trying to make this a technical problem (with you being responsible) which will probably burn them and your customers if it goes south.",1527546433.0

They should serve as live documentation for the application itself. Make sure they run and are repeatable (some integration tests don't clean up after themselves and only run successfully once).

Trailsey,"When trying to understand whether something is well designed I look for a few ""canaries"":

- How are passwords stored (assuming the application stores passwords)?  Are they unsalted md5 (BAD)? Are they using bcrypt or scrypt (much better)?  This indicates whether the code has been maintained or allowed to go stale
- Is there good test coverage with actual unit tests?  Indicates whether things are built as reusable chunks adhering to single responsibility principle.
- Is the transactional boundary clear and consistent across functions?  Inconsistent or piece-meal transaction boundaries indicates limited adherence to an architecture (any architecture) and a poor approach to consistency.  This assumes a transactional data store, so if this doesn't exist, I'd expect a clear authorization boundary where a transactional boundary should go (i.e. the application layer or where business operations are articulated)

* Are there clear boundaries between components?
* Deep inheritance is often a sign of a fragile design.

Learn jsp/servelts technologies : These are base of server side technologies in java domain.

Spring : its a huge framework. Learn the basics of it like dependency injection, ioc, aop. Learn spring MVC.

Hibernate: it's a orm framework. You don't need to worry about writing sql queries, write everything in terms of objects
.
Grails framework : Once you know the basics of spring and hibernate, go with this. It's a rapid application development framework and follows groovy language.

 * Maven because I don't like the programmatic approach of Graddle. I like my builds to be configured rather than programmed
 * Java 8 + Lombok (it is a little like cheating, I know)
 * Guice for DI, but I would try Dagger2 or even [Feather](https://github.com/zsoltherpai/feather) 
 * Cassandra & ElasticSearch, but I really miss ACID transactions, go RDBMS go!
 * [jOOL](https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOL) as a functional oriented library. It makes Java8 streams better, without making significant changes.
 * GSON to tranform from/to json. Remember one thing: By default, GSON escapes html, disable that (use disableHtmlEscaping(true) when you set up your GSON instance) 
 * Hazelcast to share data between nodes (Queues and caches) I like it because it doesn't need extra servers, but I'm not comfortable enough with it yet
 *  No template language (good) but AngularJs (bad). I wish I started with React, Vue or even WebComponents
 * Webjars to include javascript/css dependencies directly into the pom.xml and not use any Node related stuff. Works great, but I there is no way to use TypeScript, Sass and I feel kind of lonely.
 * No extra library for websockets. Spark support was enough to me needs (basically show task progress)

Regarding the ""Is it feasible to have all POST bodies be bound without explicitly doing some in each handler?"" Not directly, but I ended up with a SparkHelper class to map and transform the standard CRUD operations. So instead of

    Spark.get(""/user/:id"", ""application/json"", (req, res) -> {
        Long id = Long.parseLong(req.param(""id""));
        return userRepo.get(id);
    }, jsonTransformer);

    Spark.post(""/user/"", ""application/json"", (req, res) -> {
        UserDTO user = jsonParser(req.body(), UserDTO.class);
        return userRepo.save(user);
    }, jsonTransformer);


    Spark.delete(""/user/:id"", ""application/json"", (req, res) -> {
        Long id = Long.parseLong(req.param(""id""));
        return userRepo.delete(id);
    }, jsonTransformer);

you can just write

    sparkHelper.crud(""user"", userRepo)

And get all field mapping, transaction management, parsing, etc. in one place, nice and consistent. And if you are smarter than me, you could use a userService and take care of validations before even entering the userRepo, as you should.

For json, I definitely recommend using gson, if for some reason that doesnt suit you, jackson has always been fine for me, a close second. I also recommend using either immutables.io or lombok for creating data objects. IMO immutables is less witchy and more powerful, but lombok is good for quick and dirty.

As for websockets, I would question if you really need a server-push model or if a client-poll model is sufficient. I think you'll find that you can have an easier time reasoning about your service if you put together a well thought out client-poll model, and that you really only need the server-push model for real-time or time-critical data.

_INTER_,"It's called [Composition over Inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance). Composition is indeed favored in many situations.

Inheritance is a very strong coupling of superclass to sublasses (an *is-a* relationship).
With inheritance the subclasses are also of the supertype. So you could do the following:

    List<Animal> animals = List.of(new Dog(), new Cow()); // (1)
    for(Animal animal : animals) {
        animal.makeSound(); // (2)
    }

(1) You can add an instance of Dog or Cow or any other Animal to the list. But not of some other type, even if they have a method called makeSound.

(2) The compiler knows that every subclass of Animal has the method makeSound, so it can be called.

Though this example would be much cleaner with an interface, especially now that you have default methods.

In reality inheritance is also often used to extend a class in some library / framework (which is not in your control) with your specific logic.

",1527110629.0
Khenghis_Ghan,"Just one example, you may want to have a field inside a subclass which is private to the class. Maybe the dog subclass has an element ""tricks"". There are many things that are similar between dogs and cows: as you said, sound, and they might also have a field like ""diet"" or""owner"", but you can't teach a cow tricks, so it doesn't make sense for an instance of Animal::Cow to to have a ""tricks"" field. You wouldn't want there to be a tricks field in cow, even if you set it to null or zero, because creating a field with a null doesn't mean the field doesn't exist \- someone else using your code might do a test for ""if an animal knows 0 tricks"" and, when passed an instance of cow, instead of throwing an exception ""cows can't learn tricks"", the return would instead be ""this cow has 0 tricks, next instructions for the cow that knows no tricks"". 

Think of it as a ""all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares"" scenario. We wouldn't say ""why do we have squares, they're just special rectangles?"". There's all sorts of shortcuts and tricks which you can use with squares that aren't true for rectangles, but we can only use them because we know we're working with a special instance of a rectangle, the square \- similar reasoning applies for subclasses of classes.",1527109262.0
m1000,"In that example, why would you **want** to create an instance of Animal in Dog ?

Normally Animal would be declared abstract and could only serve to be overridden by classes, and you could not make an instance of it.

    abstract class Animal {
        abstract public void makeSound();
    }

    class Dog extends Animal {
        @Override
        public void makeSound() {

This is a valid point, especially if using spring boot for example. You won't be able to use many kotlin features to make it feel like you are using a different language so it gives you the feeling of ""may as well just stick with java"".

Tok-A-Mak,"It's an interesting read, but I disagree with most of the points this article tries to make.

The author appears to misunderstand Kotlins nullable types. He calls the get-or-else dereference an Elvis ""fix"", probably because he isn't comfortable with it's short syntax, yet at other places where things are slightly more verbose (companion object) he goes on to call it boilerplate. I think the Elvis syntax is perfectly expressive and exactly what one should do if the empty string is ok to be replaced with null. Later in, the article is complaining that there is no Maybe/Optional monad in Kotlin, probably not realizing that Kotlins nullable types are practically a really elegant implementation of exactly that with a big nice candy on top.",1527121569.0
shponglespore,"This article is misguided at almost every turn. Point\-by\-point:

* Name shadowing: Kotlin is not unusual in this regard. Lots of widely\-used languages \(e.g. JavaScript\) use the same scoping rules and nobody seems to have a problem understanding the difference between a variable declaration and an assignment statement.
* Type inference: ""Java does the same thing if you're lucky enough to be using the latest version"" is not an argument in favor of Java.
* Compile time null\-safety: The author is horrified to discover that the null\-safety of Kotlin's type system only applies to code written in Kotlin, and suggests Kotlin should handle Java APIs in a way that would make it incredibly tedious to call legacy Java code from Kotlin.
* Class literals: Passing a class literal to a legacy API requires an extra five characters. Boo hoo! He neglects to mention that native Kotlin APIs don't even need class literals in most cases where they're needed in Java, thanks to reified type variables.
* Reversed type declaration: The author is displeased because Kotlin is different from Java. The whole section is just him trying to come up with objective\-sounding ways to justify an aesthetic preference.
* Companion object: Once again, the entirety of the critique is that Kotlin is different from Java. If the author had started his career as a Kotlin developer, he'd be equally convinced that the idea of static members is ridiculous and counterintuitive.
* Collection literals: Apparently the author never uses any collection types besides ArrayList and HashMap, because he wants a special syntax for those two types. He's disappointed that Kotlin's `to` method is a method rather than a language feature with special syntax.
* Maybe? Nope: On one hand, yes, it would be nice if Kotlin treated nullable types as monads. OTOH, Kotlin has a much richer set of features for gracefully dealing with possibly\-null values than Java does. While it is possible to construct examples where Java code using Optional reads better than Kotlin code using null, it's equally possible to construct examples where Kotlin comes out ahead. Furthermore, it's not an apples\-to\-apples comparison, since Optional is only intended to be used for method return values. It says so right in the Javadoc!
* Data classes: The author bemoans the limitations of data classes even as he acknowledges the necessity of those limitations. He also completely overlooks the way data classes enable destructuring declarations.
* Open classes: Oh no, another thing Kotlin does differently than Java!
* Steep learning curve: I guess this is true if your idea of a steep learning curve means you have to actually learn the language instead of pretending it's a language you're already familiar with. I have used languages with a steep learning curve \(e.g. Haskell\), and Kotlin is not one of them.",1527119610.0

cryptos6,"That Java has now type inference too, is no argument against Kotlin (and the author admits that Kotlin is better in this regard).

Kotlins null-safety isn't perfect, but to conclude that no null-safety at all would be better is a bit strange.

The author states at the beginning that Kotlin had made them _less_ productive, and then he comes up with this example, that should show an advantage of Java

Java: 

    Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().registerTypeAdapter(LocalDate.class, new LocalDateAdapter()).create();

Kotlin:

    val gson = GsonBuilder().registerTypeAdapter(LocalDate::class.java, LocalDateAdapter()).create()

Crazy productivity drop!

> In the C-family of programming languages, we have the standard way of declaring types of things. Shortly, first goes a type, then goes a typed thing (variable, fields, method, and so on).

Shortly: `int i` vs. `i: Int`.

There are many good reasons to use `name: Type`. It is better suited for type inference (even Brian Goetz would use this syntax today) and the more important part (the name) comes first. Nearly all modern, statically typed languages are using this syntax, by the way. Mentioning this syntax detail in the context of productivity is just using personal taste for blaming a technology.

> Sometimes, you have to use static. Old good public static void main() is still the only way to launch a Java app. 

And then he comes up with this example:

    class AppRunner {
        companion object {
            @JvmStatic fun main(args: Array<String>) {
                SpringApplication.run(AppRunner::class.java, *args)
            }
        }
    }

That would have been enough:

    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        SpringApplication.run(*args)
    }

You can verify this by [generating a fresh Spring Boot Kotlin project](http://start.spring.io/).

The the author blames the `to` method to create maps. He forgets that Java has nothing similar. How can this feature make someone _less_ productive?

Kotlins null-safety is compared with Monad-like types. Personally I like the monad style a bit more, too, but it is just another compromise (at least as long the JVM doesn't have value types). There is no clear ""better"" here and no one prevents you from using Java `Optional` in Kotlin!

> But remember, Data classes come with the serious limitation — they are final. You cannot extend a Data class or make it abstract. 

How is this a drawback compared to Java? There are other classes than data classes in Kotlin as well. 

**Final thoughts**

This article is so poorly written! It is mainly about personal taste and barely explains why Java should make you more productive. If you would make a fair comparision, you would find much more awkward things in Java than in Kotlin, but the team of the author is used to Java and that is all about. They don't know Kotlin well, they don't like it for some reason and now they let know the world.

KangstaG,"Many of the points the author makes nitpick at certain syntactical differences.  In a debate between Java vs Kotlin, it's not even worth discussing unless if there is something outrageously bad about the syntax.  Some of his topics have some substance:

Compile time null\-safety:  He says it's a great feature but complains it becomes a problem when interfacing with Java code because of [platform types](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#notation-for-platform-types) \(`!`\).  He complains that, with !, it leads programmers into a false sense of security, because the object could be null but Kotlin doesn't force you to handle it.  This is true, but it's the reality of Kotlin having to be fully compatible with Java.  Kotlin could make the type of all objects coming from Java true optionals, but that would make interfacing with java code extremely painful because you would have to handle possible null values everywhere.

Companion object:  He makes another ""Kotlin style is bad argument"" and then goes on to say that you can't remove static members from a language.  But kotlin just did and it works.  Also, by having companion object, us programmers can see how similar static members and singletons are and it becomes just another detail that is abstracted away that we don't have to worry about.

Maybe? Nope:  Mostly a style thing.  Instead of having `map()` for optionals which is purer syntax for functional programming, there is `?.let()` .  But optionals are so core to Kotlin that it deserves it's special syntax.  `?.` is extremely useful syntax for chaining function calls with optionals and `let()` is it's own function that is useful in many other situations.

Steep learning curve:  This is a valid concern, but, in my experience, learning many programming languages and technologies, it's very easy for a Java programmer to pick up Kotlin and start using it.  There are a lot of idioms, nuances, and other things in Kotlin so it takes time to becoming an expert in the language, but that could be said for anything.

HFT uses longs.  They are faster than doubles and more precise.  You say the long represents 10^-6 or something and go from there (not cents because you usually need a little more precision).

This is using a variable 'password' to provide the password and a viable 'username' to provide the username.  However in your payload you have the values hard coded:

    connection.setRequestProperty(""password"", ""123"");

    payload = ""{\""username\"":\""hashik\"",\""password\"":\""123\""}"";//JSON

Edit to address the various responses:

I'm not arguing against Python from a pure language perspective.
But from a deployment/installation perspective I don't understand this choice. Maven is an elegant technology where the required artifacts are fetched automatically from metadata (the POM), even across various OSs and OS flavors. Very little needs to be installed manually upfront (JDK/JRE, the tiny Maven tarball).

In contrast with Python I had to deal with Python installation/version problems, problems with permissions around pip, and problems when integrating Python code into larger builds and deployment pipelines.

So, in a nutshell, someone already using Maven, choosing Python to enhance Maven's output, is kind of strange to me.

Essentially, what we are offering with Zulu is a choice of which JDK you use.  We take the OpenJDK source and build it so no magic sauce (if you'll excuse the pun) involved.  We then run it through the full JCK/TCK to ensure that it complies with the Java SE spec, as defined by the JCP/JSR.  Further to that we also run an analysis using tools we have developed to ensure that every single file that is compiled (both static and dynamically generated during the build) has the correct GPLv2 with CPE license header.  This way we can also guarantee that using Zulu you will not be encumbered by any licensing issues (for some people this is really important).

As others have said, we also offer commercial support for Zulu, essentially replicating the model used by Red Hat.  Our prices are very reasonable compared to some of our... competitors.

I remember we hit a problem that crashed their packaged JVM but not the OpenJDK package: same version, same code, same server. It was about Spring and its generate bytecode.

Honestly, it doesnt' look bright. The session was almost deserted and the peple on stage spent aout 30 minues talking just about the naming mess (javaEE -> ee4j -> jackartaEE).

After that, we finally saw a roadmap and what they plan is. as soon as the oracle -> eclipse code drop is completed, expected Q3 2018, thry will try to build the new Glassfish. Then they will release a JakartaEE 8.0 ( or 1.0, again 10 minutes spent discussing the version number). The specification versions will be 1-to-1 with JavaEE 8, so same requirements (i believe, jdk 7? Not sure).

mcroft,"In Payara's case, the target is to be compatible with JPMS when Java 11 comes out. That means that Payara Server/Payara Micro will run on Java 11, not that it will make use of modules yet.

There is a lot of discussion on the mailing lists at the moment about how to proceed, but Jakarta EE still has a long way to go.

The roadmap is best described in [this InfoWorld article](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3269210/java/java-roadmap-eclipses-jakarta-ee-enterprise-java-takes-shape.html). It seems to be behind a paywall now, but it used to say that when everything is transferred to Eclipse, there will be an Eclipse GlassFish 5.1 which will be Java EE 8 certified in Q3.

Then, the Jakarta EE 8 certification will be ratified and there will be an Eclipse GlassFish 5.2 which will be the first certified Jakarta EE 8 server with a target of Q4.

Jakarta EE in Eclipse is very much a community effort and the discussions are all happening publicly like, for instance, should we make composability a key part of the platform? What about profiles, should we create more?

There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about Jakarta EE. In my opinion, the way that MicroProfile has developed is a good template for what to expect from Jakarta EE. It's already attracted new companies - Lightbend and Microsoft in particular.

While Jakarta EE might seem to be a bit stalled right now, there's a lot of behind-the-scenes work going on. The ""real"" work (as I see it) is continuing in MicroProfile though. I fully expect those specs to end up in EE4J - whether they get to be part of Jakarta EE 9+ is, in many ways, up to the community (though I suspect they will).",1526375806.0

rzwitserloot,"This thread already has direct answers to your question, so I'll leave them be. Instead, a tangent on nullity in general, and how to improve your code:

* Anytime you're dealing with types which have a sensible 'blank' instance, you should generally return that instead of null when returning. So, return an empty list, and not null. Return an empty string, and not null. etcetera.
* Use methods which have built-in 'if null' mechanics. For example, don't call java.util.Map's get method. Call getOrDefault or computeIfAbsent instead.
* Write explicit null-checks (x.getClass() is a cheap way to do it, or use lombok's @NonNull annotation to get an NPE that includes the param name in the message) to confirm that method parameters that you aren't expecting null in, are null checked ASAP. This way, problems here always result in exceptions and the exceptions point right at the problem, ensuring you can solve them quickly and easily.

Also, some introspection on the difficulty of true null checks:

* Lots of java code (notably, all of the core libs) aren't annotated. You'd either have to rely on a separate 'third party' listing (with no guarantee in the API that this list is adhered to in version updates), or sort of roll with it. It's really, _really_ annoying to get a 'you have to check for null!' warning _EVERYWHERE_ you interact with code from the core libs or third party libraries. I have no real solution to this, but I believe intellij ships with a built-in list of nullness in the core libs, at least.
* @NonNull and generics just does not work. Consider: you want a method that receives a List<String>, except you just don't care about the nullity of strings. If you do nullchecks when reading the strings, your code is solid regardless of the nullity of that string (if it was already a nonnull string, the nullchecks are pointless, but they don't hurt), and if you never add a null into the list, again, it does not matter. So how do you say this? @DontCareAboutIt? It's not the same as List<@Nullable String>, because you can add nulls to that list. You really need 4 nullities, not 2 ([A] dontknow/legacy, [B] definitely never null, [C] definitely can contain null, [D] either way is fine this code checks on read and never writes em). No @NonNull system I know of is this complete.
* Generics part 2: Revenge of the question marks: Take j.u.Map: I have Map<String, @NonNull String>, and then call map.get(""foo""). Well, the get method returns 'T', so, T translates to @NonNull String, so, it can't return null, right? Whups. It's unclear what this means. So how do you do this? You can't.

I'm not trying to sway you from using @NonNull and such: These are useful annotations. Just be aware you should consider them hints, or at least, an incomplete add-on to the type system. It'll never be pain-free.

dododge,"The Eclipse JDT batch compiler can do this and can pretty much be used as a drop-in replacement for javac, but:

- The last time I used it, it didn't know about null usage in standard library methods so it complains about them. There is a way to tell it the nullness of library code, but it requires creating little files using a modified Java class/method signature notation which is not going to be familiar to most developers, and it silently ignores typos and errors in those files (which have a very fiddly syntax) without telling you about the problem. I ended up writing my own syntax checker just for those files.

- It doesn't have the same internal APIs that javac does, so you can't use *other* add-on checkers such as Google's error-prone at the same time.

- Its flow analysis is paranoid about field values and basically assumes that a @Nullable field could be switched to null by another thread at any time. This means if you do a null check on a field directly, it will assume that later accesses to the field in the same method are still unchecked and complain about them. The workaround is to copy the field value to a local variable first, check the variable for null, and then in the rest of the method do all of your reads using that variable instead of accessing the field directly. That has the potential to get a bit messy.

The ""checker-framework"" static analyzer is another one that can do nullness checks. It works as an annotation processor plugin to javac.

- It is slow and can dramatically increase build times, for example from 2 minutes to 15 minutes. After I converted a bunch of anonymous classes to lambdas it became so slow that I'd have to kill it after a couple *hours* and gave up on it entirely.

- It does have default nullness information for most if not all of the standard library. It also has a way to add nullness data for other code, and the syntax it uses is much closer to regular Java code than what Eclipse's compiler uses.

- Its flow analysis assumes that regular fields do *not* spontaneously change value, so you can check a field once and continue to read from it without complaint.

Some of the other checkers such as error-prone and nullaway are basically using checker-framework's code under the hood, so you can get most of the same checking from them without the slowdown.",1526420985.0

desrtfx,"Let me preface this by telling you that I am speaking on behalf of myself, not of the entire mod community.

I fully understand the desire for high quality surveys that could drive the Java ecosystem forward.

Yet, I find it alienating that *you*, the *community*, are now arguing about the *""No Surveys""* rule that was established because of *multiple requests* from *you*, the *community*. We established the rule because at a time the subreddit was flooded with low quality surveys and with plain and simple programming help masked as surveys (""[Survey] should I use X or Y for Z?).

I have looked through our *moderation log* and found that we, the moderators, do not actively remove any surveys. It is *you*, the *community*, who *report* these posts *multiple times* until the amount of reports exceeds the threshold for our *AutoModerator* to remove the post.

Personally, I find it sad that quite often perfectly valid, good quality, interesting posts (including surveys) get downvoted to oblivion and/or reported multiple times so that they get removed.

Also, the moderation log hinted a pattern that posts from certain users (of which quite a few are active in this discussion) get frequently downvoted and reported. In reddit's terms content that receives frequent downvotes is considered spam. 

It is very disturbing and sad to see that as soon as certain users post anything, they get downvoted and/or reported, no matter how high quality or interesting their content may be.

So, in the matter of the surveys I have to brush us moderators off because we are not the culprits here. *You*, the *community* obviously have something against this content because otherwise it wouldn't get reported sufficiently often enough to be removed.

Same applies for ""Spam"" reports. Certain users automatically seem to get downvoted and reported for spamming - often only mere minutes after their posts.

I won't publish the names of the users that receive frequent reports, so there is no use in asking. ",1526404294.0

Personally, I have a bachelors in CS with no special focus on Java (had one Java course in first year, that's all), and I had no trouble getting the job, nor do I have trouble keeping up - quite the opposite.

Droid2Win,"Ok, so I did exactly what you are trying to do, so here are my thoughts.

I got a bachelor's degree in a completely unrelated major. So I still had the bachelor's, but it wasn't in anything tech related. The career path I had been pursuing wasn't working out, so I decided to change to programming. Java was what I wanted a job in, I already knew some Java so brushing up on it and getting solid with it was easy for me.

I went and got the Oracle Certified Java Professional certification, the higher level they offer. I wanted something to say that I knew the stuff because I didn't have a CS degree. Here's the thing, though, no employer knew about or gave a shit about that certification. Most of the time I had to explain to them what it even was. If you expect the cert to open doors, it won't. The value of it though is that the test is fucking hard. I had to be GOOD with the language to get it, and that skillset is what really mattered in the end.

Interview wise, not having a CS degree or professional experience hurt me bad. I got ruled out again and again for that, and it was a painful process. I stuck with it though and found success with a company whose interview process was less a resume review and more a coding challenge. I actually had a chance to show how well I understood the language, and because of all the work I had put in studying it I aced the test. And then they hired me, and I've been good ever since.

Tldr it's harder to do it without a CS degree but not impossible. Make sure you really know your shit and don't give up.",1526099696.0

I remember we had an actual medical doctor coming to our IT classes because he wanted to take part into some IT-related hospital projects and they couldn't involve him without proper credentials.

It is totally possible to get jobs at the highest level without a CS degree.

That said, I would argue against wasting time and/or money on certificates. No one cares about them, and as far as I can tell they're mostly just a scam. Focus on figuring out what you'll need to be able to do to impress interviewers - that's what will matter for getting started.",1526104009.0
developer0,"I will share some advice and experiences with you as I was once in a similar boat. I got a BA in Music. Then, I got halfway through a Master's in the same, and thought, well, maybe this wasn't such a good idea if I want to make a decent living. Fortunately, I had grown up with programming as a fun hobby, so I decided to turn it into a career. Best life decision I've ever made, by the way.

The way I made it happen is first, I switched to a Graduate Certificate in CS program offered by the university I was already attending. It's basically just CS and Math courses, took me three semesters, and is almost equivalent to a BS. That opened the door for me to get one internship (for the one summer I had within those semesters). That gave my resume some substance and I was able to get an entry-level software developer gig.

First of all, I don't think going through such a program is best if you are simply looking at getting a good job with a good salary. The key to that is networking, building a portfolio, and interviewing well. You can break into the field with any four-year degree. However, it will benefit you in the long run and can be rewarding for less tangible reasons to get an education in the fundamentals. Assembly language, compilers, data structures, discrete math, computation theory, etc. will give you depth as a developer. You will have an easier time picking up various techs and it will give you a better chance of getting into a higher-tier company where almost every developer has a CS degree. It needs to be from a good school, though. Mine was from one with no reputation for a CS program (although it is accredited) so I don't feel that the certificate made much difference in that regard.

About certifications: I have been on the other side of the interview table for a while now, and I will say the ones who have certifications from Oracle or wherever tend to be less competent than candidates who don't. It is not generally regarded as something that adds value to your profile unless it is something like a giant financial services company that doesn't really see developers as human beings. (I know Visa, for instance, automatically screens you out if you don't have a CS degree.) If you feel that it is helping you to learn the skills, then go for it, but I would only add it to my resume if I had no experience.

As others will tell you, just start creating things and make them public. If you can contribute to some popular open-source projects, even better. Employers do look at that, and some even consider your Stack Overflow contributions and your blogs.",1526100919.0

Thus you don't have a clear separation between client and server. Try to connect a non JSF-Client with the JSF-Server side ... Or try to make a system test just under the UI layer. This would be fine with a REST architecture and a client application written in JavaScript (with React, Vue.js and the like).

There are some the reasons why the web works so well. And Roy Fielding analyzed and described these reasons in his doctoral thesis today known as REST. JSF is more or less the opposite of REST. REST is not the only possible way to go, of course, but there should be a good reason to deviate from these principles, at least if deviation is so strong as with JSF.",1526021786.0

halfastack1,"Ok so obviously, I write a Java EE tutorial site, and I'm biased... But I tell you a couple of things from my perspective...

* Java EE is still very much used... Sometimes, you'll hear squabbling of enterprise java devs arguing whether JEE or Spring is better. Who cares. If you master one, you'll not have that much difficulties to switch. And Java EE is now becoming JakartaEE - exciting times ahead methinks
* There is A LOT to love about this technology!

Now, as I said, I am biased... I think the most difficult thing is that because there's so much in the beginning, it can be HUGELY overwhelming... You have you application server, your application, your implementation of various standards (i.e. Hibernate), and then underlying stuff like DB connection that can fail, or whatever else... I'm not even mentioning that you HAVE to use some kind of packaging and dependency management software like Maven or Gradle, and that many students fresh out of school do not know git or any similar SVC software, so it all adds up to A LOT of stuff to learn and process. Right? 

But to me, the beauty is, it's actually not that complicated when you realize what it is that these things do for you... When you realize how incredibly simplified view of DB Hibernate brings, and how things like Restful API easily integrates with your JS frameworks of yesterday...   

Java EE is, to me, battle tested. It's not sexy. You have to write a ton of boilerplate code (oh yea, I forgot to mention JBoss Forge as another tool to use). When you get an exception, you get like 100-300 lines of code in certain frameworks (I'm looking at you, Liferay!) and when something goes wrong, it's very hard to debug because you have so many moving parts... But once you at least peek into the power of those things, you realize it's not useless; it's actually amazing what it can do for you if you know what you're doing...

beowulf_71,"So as many replies have indicated.. the experience is the more important thing here as you are right out of college. Some of the stuff you have to use may be dated.. which could open opportunities for you at the company to update them with a bit more modern options. That said, the good news here is there are TONS of resources on the web around these dated technologies so you will be in good hands as you learn to be able to find information on the net and not get bogged down with issues that new tech may present. Between books, SO, and so on, pretty much anything you may want/need to do is covered, probably in multiple ways.
JEE is very relevant today.. lots of the frameworks within a JEE stack are used today for enterprise software as well as back end hobby projects. Example.. some flavor of JDBC is used either directly or by an ORM solution. JMS over any number of message stacks is useful and very relevant today. Struts (hopefully Struts 2) while dated is still relevant in that it hits on the MVC pattern and even if you were to do what is more commonly done today with Rest API endpoints (using JAXRS) with a single page app built in React/Angular making ajax requests.. it is still the same MVC paradigm (more or less.. there is MVVM, etc), just different ways of obtaining the same or similar results.

So use it, learn it, maybe pitch newer ways to do it. All of it will result in good starting experience as you also build up your knowledge of Java.

Whoever gave you this info may not quite know what they're talking about as you usually don't use Struts and J2EE together. 

Stuts is pretty outdated. Was very common for a while.

This is great. MySql is widely used. Jdbc knowledge is helpful.

ryanjbaxter,"Probably the biggest advantage to using the Spring Cloud Gateway over Zuul is that it is based on a reactive stack, more specifically Project Reactor.  The key advantage that a reactive stack provides has to do with scalability.  You can handle much more throughput with the Gateway than you can with Zuul with the same resources.  In addition the Gateway provides a number of features that are not available/not possible to support with Zuul.  You mentioned rate limiting, but there is also the ability to support WebSockets for example.

In general IMO the Gateway is much more easy to configure when it comes to defining routes.  It is easy to add filters manipulate the request/response and predicates to direct routes.  Doing the same thing in Zuul would be much more challenging.",1526067652.0

javalin_io,"> Sought out some docs and other google searches only to realize.. Javalin isn’t as everywhere as I originally thought it was. Some part of me thought this thing was well established. There’s more on JavaSpark than there is Javalin.

We just released v1 six months ago. Since then we've had ~100k sessions on the website, with ~70k ""users"" (so about 30% are returning users). It's been a successful launch, but it's definitely not established.

> So, is this thing used in production by anybody here?

About 75% of our survey respondents are either running in prod or launching soon. Out of the people running in prod, *60% have less than 1k users per day*, while *40% have 100k to 1m users per day*.

cynicalh,"""While there are occasional uses for interruption, it should be avoided. The fundamental problem with interrupts is that they are effectively globals. They are scoped to the thread, rather than to the task.""

That's not a problem, that's the point of it. It signals to the thread, that it should exit. While task is something abstract, thread represents something more physical (cpu+registers..). Note that you can't stop a thread. Thread ends either because its run() method exited, or the program ended. So this interrupted() call is handy when you want to set a sign, that run() should exit its loop. Also you don't care about what the thread is doing while signalling interrupt. This is useful not only while interrupting computation, but also while shuting down/reconfiguring thread pool (or ExecutorService), but the program can continue.",1525742483.0

It's way too common that you need to use something like Object.wait(), Thread.join(), Future.get(), etc in a method that needs to be uninterruptable (or just can't have ""throws InterruptedException"" because it's implementing an interface without it)

And it's possible to do that correctly, but the correct code looks like this:

    try {
        waitForSomething();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        try {
            while (true) {

As for Java - if you don't have prior experience with either Swing or JavaFX **and** if you know for certain your project is safe to require Java 8 or newer (i.e. no corporate/other limitations preventing an upgrade) - I'd say go for JavaFX.

SWT is native-ish, but makes you jump through allocate/dispose hoops for native peers.

My suggestion is not to learn one or the other, but to learn both. Use Python to prototype the optimal model, and then use Java to build the model in an application that can spit out results in a fraction of the time it takes to run in Python

cpdean,"AI is a very large umbrella term for a class of problems that people generalize as ""the computer thinking"".

A lot of people in this thread seem to be saying that AI means implementing neural networks, but there's actually a ton of things you can play with that count as AI:

Algorithms for searching/algorithms and data structures for ""playing games"":

  * A-star search
  * min/max search

Using data and writing a program to make educated guesses about it (also known as ""Statistics""):

  * decision trees/random forests
  * logistic regressions / linear regressions
  * support vector machines

making a computer ""understand"" things about written language:

  * find the subject in a sentence (part-of-speech tagging / entity extraction)
  * generate gibberish that almost looks like language (markov chains)

Getting good at AI is more about learning about how to solve a lot of problems like the ones above and then coming up with ways to adapt them to things in the real world by collecting and cleaning data, as well as combining the output of known algorithms in novel ways.  I think that if you limit yourself to just learning how to use Tensorflow you'll actually be setting yourself up to be worse at solving AI problems in general compared to learning Statistics and other stuff first to give you a better foundation in problem-solving.  A lot of ideas in AI are not new and there's a ton of other resources available to you if you search for them without using the trending buzzwords.",1525625183.0
,"As cpdean said, almost everyone is considering that AI equals to machine learning or deep learning. Although the field is indeed going to to that direction, creating  simulation models and programming is closer to classical AI, which is more algorithmic. There are also some cool things from deep learning that you need to understand classical AI to do.

For classical AI, I would recommend this amazing course https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS188.1x-4/1T2015/course/ (it's over, but I think you can see all contents and do the homeworks hopefully) and also this one https://udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271. I like the first one better, the second one is from 2011 and it's rough around the edges, but it's from Peter Norvig which is really important in the field.

If you want, you can also go to the deep learning approach. But it's one that doesn't involve as much programming. If you want that, it's better to use tensorflow, pytorch or something like that. Andrew's course is a good start in the classical ML. Don't know about his new deep learning course. I did Geoffrey's one on Coursera and it's good, but it's a really difficult course which doesn't have much programming. You don't need to program as much with DL, just describe the graph, data, loss function, etc. It's not easy, but it's a somewhat different set of skills than programming I would say. Your error will hardly be some wrong piece of algorithm, but more probably some wrong assumption about calculus or statistics. I love deep learning, I'm not saying it's bad to learn it, but at least for me (I mostly study deep reinforcement learning), classical AI is a good start.",1525657875.0

You should explore first free ready to use software (openfoam, freecad with its FEM module).

georgebanis,"If you want to play with what you already know deeplearning4j and spark's mllib are both battle tested.

However they are not my recommended approach.

The argument about being production ready is invalid. Our entire backend stack is solely comprised of Java (more than 1000 microservices) and yet we only use python to train and serve models. And serving is actually pretty decent, we can easily handle over 10,000 requests per second on each model.

First of all all the new libraries come python-first so you have a very big leg up. There's a very big python community around ML now and you definitely want to be in that ecosystem.

Second, the prototyping phase is much faster in python since you dont need to recompile your code all the time and all your data is already in memory thanks to jupyter notebooks.

Third, I dont recommend doing prototyping in python and serving in java because the code implementations of the model can be subtelly different and cause impossible to debug issues.

I've tried most ML courses including Andrew Ng's and I'd say bar-none the best for beginners is Udacity's intro to ML  https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120

halfastack1,"Hi there,

see, the thing is, I feel like it's quite difficult to learn JEE from nothing. You may go through Oracle's thousand-page manuals, which are boring and provide code snippets that you may or may not be able to make work, depending on what you understand and how well did you understand the text around.

Honestly, your best bet would be Pluralsight's [Java EE](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/java-ee-foundations) path. 

Also, pardon with the *shameless plug*, but I do feel that www.halfastack.com could be of value to you. I started writing it recently precisely because there seemingly were no resources aimed at intermediate Java developers who needed to get into the JEE space for free on the internet. Check out, for example, my latest [JPA](https://www.halfastack.com/jpa-practical-part-deploy-and-explore-working-jpa-application/) project, which includes: 

* 2 articles on JPA theory
* An article on the whole setup - fire up an SQL server and connect it to a Java application server
* A code sample on github that you can download, deploy, extend, and play with

 I genuinely believe that if you want to get into JEE, the content of my articles is precisely for that - easy-enough getting started with through step-by-step instructions on how to set it up. So far, there are contents on only EJB and JPA, I'm working on RESTful APIs, and will be continuing with further stuff like JMS,CDI, and other objectives you can find in the [EX183](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex183-red-hat-certified-enterprise-application-developer-exam#Objectives) exam. 

My aim is to enable developers to be familiar enough with JEE so that when they see the huge and complex code-base of their new setup, they will find at least a couple of things familiar... :) Anyhow, the JEE Pluralsight path will definitely be worth it, though they too seem to be in the process of creating it (or have stopped quite early).

lemantis,"SAAS is an obvious method to enforce license compliance. But, if SAAS does not fit your solution, or your customer's requirements, here's an alternative:

Get to know and build trust with your customers before giving them your software. That way you do not have to attempt to enforce your license by futile software solutions.

As others have mentioned, what's the point, when the software can be reverse engineered anyway. Instead you simply give your trusted customer the software, your war file, and in a license agreement describe what terms and conditions you permit the customer to use the software. Be reasonable with your customers, and most customers will be respectful and reasonable with you.

Obviously a malicious customer can disregard your license terms and do whatever they want. But surprisingly many won't, at least that's my experience.

The company where I currently work have had the unpleasant experience to encounter untrustworthy customers - the initial allure of the money appeared to be just to great to walk away from. We attempted to enforce the license with a secret key and online validation, but it wasn't sufficient.

Granted, we do include some level of support in most our contracts. So even if the software is deployed on-prem, the customer also pays for upgrades and support. I suppose that is an additional motivation for the customer to stay within the bounds of the license agreement.",1525458264.0

Using a stack to keep track of every position that has more than one possible path would allow you to just pop the last position that has another viable path.

These eager methods will cause problems e.g. you write your code and later realize you need additional operations performed. You have the choice of adding more methods calls of the same style that create more collections that are not needed at all or rewrite everything to stream.

Your usage examples are the same as using stream except not writing the .stream\(\) and producing problems when used. Also adding a second way to do the same thing, in this example a more functional style to handle collections looks pretty bad to me.

eliasv,"Okay, well off the top of my head my main worry would be performance.

For any mutable implementation of `List` it seems to me that there is no way to chain operators have have them evaluate lazily and do clever things like folding operations together. There is no way to know which operation is terminal so you have to re-materialize the collection on every single operation. Ouch!

But then again the first operation could materialize into an immutable collection, in which case any subsequent operations *can* be lazy... Hmm but not really because there's no guarantee that the *entries* in the collection are immutable, or that the operators don't capture some other mutable state, meaning any operations may change behaviour between when the user *thinks* a list is materialized and when it's contents are *actually* materialized. Not tenable imo. Is there a solution I'm not seeing here?

So no, I don't think I'd use them much as you get very little in return for the performance tradeoff.

More importantly, I think a fair few developers *wouldn't be aware* of this tradeoff, and encouraging them to *unknowingly* choose worse performance by offering a slightly neater API is a really, really bad idea.

FWIW I'd prefer to have common collectors such as `toList` `toSet` etc. on `Stream`.",1525253006.0

rzwitserloot,"The author is doing a _really_ bad job at explaining context.

Let's start at the first example: A method named `getDbConnection`. The article tries to show how to make this method work. But the method itself is already a broken design: __of course__ it is reasonable for a method named `getDbConnection` to carry a `throws SQLException` clause, at which point this code turns into a simple, trivial one-liner.

The need to have it not throw that belies one of 3 possible issues:

* The programmer is of the opinion checked exceptions are a huge mistake and wants to get out of it ASAP. Perhaps you shouldn't be programming in java if this is the mindset. I don't particularly feel like commenting on whether this mindset is valuable or not, but if that was the intent of the post, the author should probably say so.
* The code needs to be used in lambdas which interact annoyingly with these. But note that the author goes into some depth about how to deal with checked exceptions inside lambda blocks and those are better solutions, so this pretty much can't be the intent, I presume.
* There's bad APIs: The `getDbConnection` method is inherited from an interface or superclass which the programmer cannot change, and the parent type's definition does not carry `throws SQLException`, which means you cannot add it either. Okay, sure, that's annoying and means you have to work around it, but the problem is generally to not use badly designed APIs, that's plan A: Get rid of that API.

This article is a bit like a carpenter writing a blog post about how to secure screws with a hammer, which then does an excellent job explaining all the details and nuances of how to do it. Without explaining that your first thought should be to use a screwdriver, and doing anything written in the article is kludging around and writing bad code. Sure, sometimes there's no screwdriver available and the article is legitimately useful, but it's misleading nonetheless.

Here's my advice:

* RuntimeException is 'bad' because you make it really hard for callers to catch this and draw meaningful conclusions from the error. It's still a LOT better than `System.err.println(e)` because the latter means code continues to execute whilst state is invalid, AND the toString of an exception doesn't print nearly all the details that are in there. So, you now get tens to hundreds of stack traces on your console, most of which are irrelevant, and the one relevant one in the mess has less data than you'd want. It's also _impossible_ for callers to try to deal with the problem. So, go into your IDE settings and update the template for the default 'add a try/catch here' action to do: `throw new RuntimeException(""Lazy programmer"", e);`, it's a big improvement.

* The real solution is to be liberal with `throws` clauses. Put em everywhere. A method named `getDbConnection` should absolutely `throws SQLException`. A throws additition to your method signature is a lot shorter than a try/catch block, and doesn't hide or otherwise convolute the trace!

* The default error handler is good. Embrace the default error handler. Trust it. All code has the notion of an entry point somewhere. For simple apps, it is `public static void main`. For web handler code, it's your servlet entry point or `@GET` annotated handler method if you use jersey or whatnot. Generally, you should declare that 'entry point method' to `throws Exception`. The caller, unless you're using unbelievably crappy libraries, will do an absolutely _excellent_ job handling any exception thrown here: For example, a servlet runner will log the entire exception causal chain with the type and the message, AND log the IP and request data of the triggering request, AND serve up a 500 error, AND has configuration directives to fancy up that 500 page as you desire. This is a no-brainer: Imagine having to do all that yourself. Why reinvent the wheel?

* Because the default error handler is so good, you should be liberal with throws clauses. An SQLException that bubbles through 18 calling layers right up to the jersey container? That's a _good thing_. If anything in those 18 layers has a good idea about how to handle it they can do so, and if nobody does, well, what do you think? Log the heck out of it all and serve up the properly styled 500 page IS the most appropriate strategy! It's a heck of a lot better than serving up a blank page or a template filled with blanks whilst spamming 100 traces to the log devoid of causal chains and any request headers or even the web path that was invoked.

* If APIs or lambdas block you from doing this, use [lombok @SneakyThrows](https://projectlombok.org/features/SneakyThrows) or other methods set out in the article. (DISCLAIMER: I'm a core contributor to Project Lombok).

* If the type of the exception leaks implementation details that don't make sense in the API, wrap the exception.

* When making APIs that have (and call) entry points, [A] call these entry points catching Throwable, and [B] make sure the interface or abstract class you wrote as basis for those entry points declares `throws Exception` in their type line. Example of a good job (more or less): You can write `public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception`. Example of a bad job: `Runnable`'s one method failed to do this right.

You could throw a runtime exception and handle it in the interceptor, which would generate the error response, but instead all the components where bubbling up caught exceptions, declaring the thrown exceptions up to the controller, meaning they would end in the interceptor, without any if them being handled ever.

That made code hard to follow in several situations (why is the service telling me the DMS can fail if none of its dependencies is making use of it?

DevIceMan,"> I learned today that you can create custom functional interfaces to declare types for lambda expressions. 

Speaking bluntly, you probably shouldn't propose changing/adding core language features, if you only just learned this today.


> If this can't be done can you please explain why?

It probably could be done, but you're asking the wrong question.

A core feature of Java philosophy is to not break compatibility with previous versions of Java.  As a result, Java is very timid (or cautious) about what it adds as core language features.

What you're asking for would be a language feature, and presumably one they couldn't drop support for once implemented.

In this post, I'm not judging whether that is a wise/unwise or good/bad philosophy, but you should understand that philosophy whenever you propose a language features.  It also describes a big part of why Java is successful in the ""enterprise web-backend"" field.

---

In contrast, Scala is willing to break backwards compatibility.  This has enabled Scala to be more experimental, try new language features, learn lessons from hands-on experience, and if it turns out to be a bad idea, they can deprecate it, and then eventually remove or change it.

This results in Scala having a ton of powerful language features, which are extremely unlikely to appear in Java in the next 10 years.   That's awesome, but also comes with costs like:

* Upgrading Scala versions might force you to rewrite parts of your application.
* If libraries aren't maintained, they can quickly become unusable due to incompatibilities with newer versions of Scala.
* If two libraries are only compatible with two different versions of Scala,  you might not be able to use both without significant effort.  (Maybe there is an easy way, but I haven't found it)

eliasv,"That doesn't make any sense. The object which is instantiated by the lambda will have a bunch of unimplemented  methods, because the lambda only provides an implementation for one of them. So what do the other methods do? Throw? That's a terrible idea!

Yes, the compiler will be able to determine which of the methods the lambda implements, but when you pass that lambda around, everyone else just sees it as an object implementing an interface. They don't know that only one of the methods will actually have an implementation, and they certainly have no mechanism to figure out *which* is implemented, and which are not.

Moreover, even if this did make sense it would be pointless. What problem are you even trying to solve here? You already have two (actually safe) mechanisms to evolve the program you describe:

rzwitserloot,"Because java is tool oriented.

Most programming languages are more or less (I'm being intentionally a bit dense here) designed as if those who will write it, are using Windows Notepad. As in, the dumbest possible editor imaginable.

Maybe I'm being too harsh and the assumption is a capable, but nevertheless entirely context-unaware, text editor.

Java is the exception. Java is a horrible, HORRIBLE language in notepad or even emacs and vi. As a consequence, almost nobody writes java in emacs or vi. The few that do make it their life's work to call java names and question the parentage of those who dare to program in java.

But that's because of lack of context. Context-aware java editors, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ are great. They turn java's annoyances and verbosity into advantages.

When you run a rename method script in eclipse or intellij, it... works. Sure, unit tests are good to have, but, you really don't have to rely on them to ensure that this worked. It'll work. The IDE fixes your code, guaranteed. When you run a 'find callers' script, it'll find em _ALL_. It's not a heuristic scan. Every hit is a hit. No false positives. No missed items. Java's strict and overly verbose type system makes that possible. That's what I mean when I say: Turning java's annoyances into advantages.

Changing the language at the level truffle does means you have to kiss such smart editors goodbye. And once you start writing java (even truffled java) in a dumb terminal, well...

If your employer pays for them its not a bad option. If you take them seriously they will make you a better programmer. You'll learn the language and APIs to a much higher degree than through natural experience.

Be warned if you just try to pass them you'll probably come out worse. I interview a lot of contractors who are certified, yet they fail to answer basic questions and have no idea about writing clean testable code.

I find they have memorised the right answers but still have no idea how to write code that is easy to understand and change. Often they will use knowledge of advanced language features (e.g. reflection and concurreny) to add complicated hacks that need removing because they are so brittle.

Language certifications are there to show you know some rather specific details of a language in depth. Not that you can use that language to build software. Companies, mainly ones hiring junior developers, are mostly concerned about you being able to actually build stuff.

Java is a programming language like any other. It has good and bad sides. Because it's relatively old it has had time to make and fix many mistakes that more hipster approved languages are suffering from.
It has garnered some notoriety for being verbose but that's much exaggerated. People who know what they are doing can write clean and concise Java no problemo. Lots of very good and very prominent software is written in it. Not just ""enterprise apps"". Minecraft is one example. Facebook's Presto is another. 

The JVM is very fast for a VM hosted language - probably the best there is. You will definitely not miss the slowness of Ruby. 

Modern Java is often augmented by very good libraries like Immutables. It allows one to create very clean code that mixes imperative and functional styles with ease. Only morons write Java these days with the old style FactoryManagerHandler bullshit. Between Immutables and Java 8 lambdas it can be a very good experience. Yeah, for a true FP experience Clojure is better. For a nazi style typing system Haskell is better. But Java is the language of the person that gets shit done. It ain't perfect but it works.

I'm glad i was given the chance to do rails because i learned a lot about functional programming and dynamicness. But i would never ever ever ever... ever do a big project with dynamic typing again. From my experience lacking static types, for example in ruby, is compensated with so much more tests... And i never felt any confidence changing existing code, because refactorings produced subtle errors that wouldn't have happend if there were static types. For me, this is the single biggest advantage of java over Ruby. Nowadays, one can write very Elegant code in java while still having a very low bullshit factor. The toolset is limited, so understanding foreign code has a very high chance of being easy. I personally can't say that about ruby and rails. If you are naturally curious and open for static typing, i bet you will have a good time with it. Other topics, like very mature tooling and a super fast runtime are also big pluses...to be honest, i can't see many disadvantages by switching.. maybe ten years ago, but not today.",1524417817.0

Java and its associated ecosystem is a work horse.

Java the language has its good and bad points. The language itself is extremely pragmatic given its age. It has one of the best language specifications you can read and generally speaking evolves in a predictable and progressive nature. The type system is not too fancy but good enough in most cases.

Although the Java lang is good, I would argue this is not its core strength. Pros include:

- The JVM is an outstanding engineering effort

- Good set of libraries

- IDEs and tooling are the best I have experienced

- Integration with other JVM languages (JRuby, Kotlin, Groovy, Scala

- Great documentation

- Release cycle cadence

- Availability of open source tools (from profilers, static analysis, code coverage, CI, CD)

- An interesting community (IMHO it has two parts a steady enterprise and a cutting edge parts. This for seems to lead Java to end up making practical decisions so people can focus on getting stuff done)

Oh and with modern Java you don't have to worry about the verbosity, if it were ever there in the first place. Although not a fully FP lang it has lambdas and type inference. You can write clean and effective code without a Abstract Proxy Factory Handler.",1524422402.0

geodebug,"Java the platform is fantastic.  You have decades of high quality libraries  available and the JVM is an excellent piece of technology.  Multi-threading and memory management is pretty much a no-brainer with the JVM.    Java platform tooling is also phenomenal.   The Java platform is also has a ton of industry backing and is frequently updated.  

Java the language is fine.  It has a lot more sugar than it used to but still doesn’t feel too modern.  That said it is one of the easiest languages to debug, refactor with confidence, and figure out what other people’s code is doing.  

Ruby is great but the platform has well known limitations.  Most Ruby shops that need to be highly scalable move to jRuby.  Seems short-sighted that your company is willing to have a brain-drain instead of going that route. 

I’d make the argument that platform is way mote important than language in the end.   I can code in many languages (big whoop) but overall I need to know I can support that code and know what the heck is going on in production.   

All that said our company embraced Amazon AWS since the beginning so a lot of my code now is as much Lambda functions in javascript and other such glue code.  

We code a lot in Groovy as well so don’t really use Java the language much at all.  

TL;DR embrace Java the platform, feel free to ignore Java the language but it isn’t that bad either.

RupertMaddenAbbott,"I moved from Ruby to Java.

Ruby was one of the first languages I learnt but Java I learnt in my first proper development job.

I loved Ruby and struggled with Java initially but now would find it quite difficult to switch back again:

* Static typing. This is really awesome but also the dependence on reflection is far less in Java. I find 3rd party code to be very easy to read whereas I would continually get stuck reading another person's Ruby code. Where does this variable come from? Where does this method come from? Everything is much more explicit in Java.
* Platform independence. Being able to write code on any OS and have it run on any OS is really great. Not just your code but any library you depend on as well. The abstraction is also much greater with Java. With Ruby, you would get cross platform packages but you would always get build warnings e.t.c. saying that some feature or another was not supported on a particular platform. Not so with Java.
* Spring Boot. I find this framework to be fantastic because it is the only one I know that strikes a balance between full stack frameworks and micro frameworks. You can glue together all of the individual libraries that you want, writing reusable auto-configuration as you go, or just use the glue that others have already written. This makes it simultaneously much more flexible than Rails but much less bare than Sinatra.
* Dependency Injection. I know some people might hate this and Ruby has no need of it but I found that by religiously using constructor injection, the complexity of my code has dramatically decreased.
* Stateless services over Stateful objects. I feel that Java tends to be more functional and less object oriented that Ruby. That is not categorically true but ActiveRecord like frameworks are not nearly as popular in Java. I much prefer this style as I find stateless methods much easier to deal with even though it has been criticised as an anti-pattern: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html.
* IDEs. Seriously, I'm not sure how I manged to write as much Ruby as I did with vim or other text editors. Refactoring, debugging and easy access to all the tools I need make me much more productive. Try IntelliJ.",1524481301.0

The type system is easily the biggest strength of Java. At first, as a Java beginner I saw more compile-time errors and it felt annoying, but once I got past the initial irritation, I realized that the compiler was saving me from a lot of bugs, sometimes serious ones.

A close second biggest strength is the ecosystem around Java. There's really nothing close as far as the stable, secure, scalable libraries and frameworks available for Java.

Like leostrauss told you, every language has good and bad parts. My biggest problem with Java is the amount of code which you need to write to get something done. On the other hand, I have written a lot of amazing and high-performance apps in Java where it was much better than Python and easier to use than C++.

shadowdude777,"Things I love about Java:

- It is a simple language. You should be able to pick it up within a few weeks if you're familiar with OOP in any capacity. There are really no hidden surprises and no arcane syntax to learn (with a few exceptions, I guess).
- The tooling is top-notch. No language has better tooling than Java. The amount of static analysis tools available is amazing. And IntelliJ is the best IDE out there.
- The library ecosystem is by far the largest available. People joke about how in Python you can just go `import solution`, but this is at least as true for Java. I have almost never had a need for a library in a project I'm working on and came up empty-handed.

Java's type system could be a little more powerful, and there are features in other languages that I wish we had. For me personally, I just try to write Kotlin whenever possible, and that gives me the perfect compromise. All of the same Java libraries and most of the tooling works for me, but I get a modern language with all of the best features I've always wanted.",1524423388.0
evil_burrito,"I have worked with lots of different languages in my career: Pascal, COBOL, VB, C, C++, Smalltalk, Ruby, and, now, Java (and others, the list reflects my age).

Engineers who complain about languages and say this one is the best and that one is the worst, are, in my opinion, wankers. A competent coder should be able to express him or herself in any language.

There are advantages and disadvantages to every language. I adore overloaded operators. But I can get shit done without them. I think overlays from COBOL are really clever, but I don't need them.

Java is a perfectly serviceable mature language with a staggering compendium of available libraries. There's something to admire in any language.",1524450943.0

There more than a few reasons the why twitter switched from ruby to java, and more than a few reasons why java is used to build scalable,  exceptionally fast, reliable databases used the world over for mission critical implementations  such as Cassandra, Neo4j, Solr, and ElasticSearch.   Netflix powers a huge overwhelming majority of its back end with Java written microservices.  

JVM is infinitely configurable, scalable, and consistent across multiple environments, from your Windows to your 10yo pre-IoT toaster. 

I used to be just like your train of thought, but these past couple years really looking into it has changed my head so much I’m, and my co workers, are still recovering from the whiplash. 

My first ever deployed project was just last year; an API service that powered a high traffic blog, and just the one instance of it took little less than 500mb of memory at peak times and required no caching strategies to stand up to the task where a python API of the same purpose needed two instances running constantly to load balance with a shared cache.

Turns out I was just working on a crap codebase. You can program great practices into Java, and get just as good results with it as with any other language. Once you understand the type system, you can use it to turn lots of runtime errors into compile time errors, and navigate through code with ease. It really shines in big complex projects where you need to untangle someone else's rat's nest, because you can use an IDE to do so in an unambiguous way. In these ""enterprise"" situations, the verbosity and limitations of the language are a blessing.

RubyMine, bless its heart, can *try* to tell you what method is being called, but it is usually just a ""best guess"".

* **My main beef with Java** is that any object could be null, which drives me absolutely bonkers. You will always have to code defensively against nulls if you are writing a method that will be called by who knows what.
* **My top Java tip** is that that checked exceptions should be treated the same as multiple returns. Java doesn't have multiple returns, so you have to throw a checked exception, and you should usually catch it almost immediately. (Painfully, many libraries do not adhere to this convention and force you to catch all kinds of truly edge-case crash-worthy exceptions that probably should just be `IllegalArgumentException`s because you called it wrong, but what can you do?)

kevinb9n,"TL;DR is at the end:

  - Switch statements now come in a simpler (arrow) flavor, where there 
is no fallthrough, no weird scoping, and no need to say break most of 
the time.  Many switches can be rewritten this way, and this form can 
even be taught first.
  - Switches can be used as either expressions or statements, with 
essentially identical syntax (some grammar differences, but this is 
mostly interesting only to spec writers).  If a switch is an expression, 
it should contain expressions; if a switch is a statement, it should 
contain statements.
  - Expression switches have additional restrictions that are derived 
exclusively from their expression-ness: totality, can only complete 
abruptly if by reason of throw.
  - We allow a break-with-value statement in an expression switch as a 
means of explicitly providing the switch result; this can be combined 
with a statement block to allow for statements+break-expression.

The result is one switch construct, with modern and legacy flavors, 
which supports either expressions or statements.  You can immediately 
look at the middle of a switch and tell (by arrow vs colon) whether it 
has the legacy control flow or not.",1524176542.0

            logger.warn(""doBinaryData should not be called."");
            taskManager.remove(task.getId());

If a method accepts exactly two parameters, it should accept exactly two individual parameters, not an array of parameters, since any array can be of any size and the method only wants two Strings. If you want to teach/practice arrays, come up with challenges to which arrays are well-suited, don't insert them where they don't belong ""just to make it trickier"" or anything like that. 

Using regex for such a simple task is needlessly complicated. Anyone reading such code would likely end up having to interpret the regex all over again (especially if it's not documented), whereas looping through the characters is equally efficient and significantly more readable.

If lambdas dealt with checked exceptions, you could do:

Now this is not to say that it shouldn't exist as a third party framework (just like, for example VAADIN), thats fine by me....BUT, to position it as the official standard way to do browser based apps, is just.....wrong..

I do most things now using HTML5 / Rest to a JavaEE backend.  The HTML5 pages are either simple static HTML, OR maybe JSP if I want to take into account things like internationalisation, or tag templates...   but nothing more.

The combination of all of these items, and a few they left out, really hit the sweet spot for me.

One thing that I think should have made the list are the `let`, `also`, `apply`, and `run` extension methods on every class.

- 1 is nice, hopefully `Optional` will mitigate this slightly better in the future when value types get rid of the indirection cost.

- 3 is nice, and is only described as a ""may be considered in the future"" in the raw literals JEP iirc. Not too important I don't think, but wouldn't hurt.

- 7 is just feature bloat imo, but that's just a personal preference. Not a fan, but willing to entertain the notion that I'm wrong about it.

far-more-simple syntactical structure. Simple loops should be able to be done with something like loop(x: 1-10) or something. That'd be pretty fancy, and would, imo improve readability. While also making the language a bit less intimidating to pick up.

heliologue,"Goetz's advice to use a Stream because the source might be infinite sounds like a very specific usage case.

Returning a `Collection` seems like a more standard API.  The consumer can then choose to stream it easily (`team.getPlayers().stream()`) or use it as-is. Returning a stream causes the consumer to have no choice but to instantiate a new copy of the list if it wants that view.

Streams are nice, but as Goetz said, ""So the question is, which is more useful to your callers"", and `Collection`s still seem like idiomatic Java (i.e., predictable) to me.",1523911083.0
zombifai,"While I think B. Goetz arguments all make sense and there's not much point in refuting them... Nevertheless, I find myself preferring collections most of the time. The reason is that once you start turning all your stuff into streams it pretty much breaks your debugging experience. There's just no way you can step through streams code and really understand what is going on, or, if you have a bug, where exactly it goes wrong.

If you never make any mistakes in your code and so you never have any bugs then this doesn't matter. And then B.Goetz arguments tell you that, most likely you want to use streams. But being human, I do greatly value the ability to debug my code, because I do make mistakes. It takes me 10x more time to figure out bugs in stream code than figure a similar bug in collections code. 

So, if you think about how easy it is to write and debug the code in the first place then I find the simplicity of materialized collections a lot more pleasant to deal with than streams. And that *does* matter. 

So I've made it rule to myself that using streams is only done on a case-by-case basis. And there has to be a good enough reason for the specific case, to be worth the penalty you are going to be taking in the debugability of your code. ",1523911487.0

Bloch's advice on why you should return a `Collection` struck me a pretty incoherent - IIRC he says it's because you can't iterate directly over a `Stream` in a for loop but can iterate over a `Collection`, forcing you to choose the latter over the former. But he totally ignores the existence of a common `forEach` method on both types that allows you to iterate over both in the same way.

Brian Goetz's reasoning, on the other hand, seems solid. Combine that with the fact that `Stream`s are way nicer to use, and I consider it an obvious choice (excepting the unusual corner cases called out in your link).",1523905840.0

MysteryManEusine,"I really like improving hash functions in Java, but I feel like it could be done better. In particular, security should be a goal, as hash collision attacks are a practical concern, and the API is unlikely to be changed again in the future - if the security won't improve, developers may as well stay with a single `hashCode` API, it's simplier this way.

What I don't like it's easy to write a bad hash function even with new methods by implementing this as if it was a regular hash code. For instance, this is quietly wrong.

    @Override
    public long longHashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(firstName, secondName);
    }

Additionally, the API is not flexible, which means that the object decides whether a hash should be secure or not. It would be better if it was up to an user (for instance, a hash table).

I'm also not sure how the user would implement `longHashCode` in practice. A bad implementation is easy to make, but I'm reading this draft and I'm not sure how to implement a good one - I assume it has something to do with `System.primitiveHashCode(Object,Lookup)`, but I don't quite understand how that works.

Is there a better way? Turns out, there is. What I would rather prefer is having a method like this in Object.

    public void hash(Hasher hasher) {
        hasher.write(hashCode());
    }

What is a `Hasher`? An interface.

    interface Hasher {
        void write(long value);

        // Add some default convenience methods operating on primitive arrays based
        // on a main one, for instance like default void write(byte[] bytes) { ... }
        // so that hashing algorithms could be faster with specific types.

        // I think it would be cool to provide default implementations for all of primitive types
        // and arrays of those.

        long getHash();
    }

How would something like this `hash(Hasher)` function be implemented? Rather straightforwardly, I would say.

    @Override
    public void hash(Hasher hasher) {
        List.of(firstName, secondName).hash(hasher);
    }

This would allow classes like `HashMap` retrieve a `Hasher` factory as an argument.
This would allow for a choice between a fast and secure algorithm.

    public HashMap(Supplier<? extends Hasher> hasherFactory);

Additionally, a default constructor could use a secure hasher by default.

    public HashMap() {
        this(new SecureHasherFactory());
    }

By the way, an explicit factory is needed for `SecureHasher` to allow for random per-hash salt. This helps avoid hash collission attacks even if the attacker managed to obtain a salt for a single hash.

This avoids the need to provide a boolean argument to a constructor. `HashMap` can safely
use the `hash` method without breaking backwards compatibility, as there is no way to
accidentally override this method, as `Hasher` is a new interface.",1523789215.0
supercargo,I think I’m missing the high level architecture of how this would work.  Statements like “Collection classes can be adapted (at user option) to use new hash codes” and other places where new functionality is “opt in”. Is the idea to put utility APIs into the core class library that can enable different/better implementations of Object::hashCode?   Or is the idea to add a new method to Object along with a value based implementation in the Object base class which collections (or anything) could then (be configured to) use instead of hashCode?,1523765896.0

Gilgamesjh,"Today java is used 99% server side, it is fast and secure.

Back in the day (say 10-15 years ago) Java was also used in the browser as an applet, and the whole security model around these kind of apps in your browser was insecure by nature. Today no external programs will run in your browser.

When Java was new, it was also slow, but this has not been the case for a long time, in fact Java is pretty fast for most things.

Much like how ActiveX and Flash are not secure The Java browser plugin was no different. The truth is the model used by browser was just crap so it is good it is gone. 

Speedwise again is mostly just people remembering the past. Java is plenty fast now. You won't get quite native C++ desktop program speeds for the UI but otherwise a Java program is often within a few percentage points of a native C++ program. ",1523557578.0

yawkat,"There is another class of attacks others haven't mentioned that is fairly specific to java: Attacks on java serialization.

Java offers a native serialization API through its Serializable and associated ObjectIOStream classes. Serializable has been around forever and large parts of the standard library and many third-party libraries implement Serializable.

The problem is this: By default, ObjectInputStream, when reading an object, will trust the class name offered by the input stream. This means the creator of the data that is being deserialized can make the OIS deserialize *any* class on the classpath. This is an absolutely massive attack surface, and again and again there are libraries where a class, when deserialized, could let an attacker execute arbitrary code.

These issues are getting fixed, but the fixes do not solve the underlying problem: Arbitrary class deserialization. More modern frameworks such as jackson do not support this by default - you have to enable it manually (for example with jacksons default typing, which has then also [lead to security issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1599) for people using it carelessly). 

Unfortunately many java programmers are oblivious to this: **Never deserialize untrusted data with default typing.**",1523623760.0
Agamen31,"Plenty of good posts here that explain how secure java is, but I just wanted to rehash what another user said into it's own top\-level comment. Typically it's user error. and not the language itself.

One example that is blatant to anybody that's seen it before, could be the use \(or lack there of\) of prepared statements to query a database.

Consider the following statement:

    SELECT name FROM students WHERE name=input;

In case SQL is new \(I don't wanna assume\), all we're doing here is selecting a name, from a table of students, where the name is equal to some input. Now we can find students in the database, sounds great!

It's important to pause here and recognize that just passing that string is extremely valid Java code, and it compiles. Some people in the industry, through incompetence, or through lack of care, might miss it and it gets through. But it has MAJOR security implications.

Lets say little Johnny is having a hard time in school, and he doesn't want his teacher to call his parents about his grades. Assuming he has access to input a query \(it doesn't really matter where. Perhaps it's a student directory, idk, make something up that makes you happy\), he can provide his own creative name that will ""attack"" the database.

Lets say Johnny wrote in the little, innocent looking textbox we created earlier, the following string:

    ""Johnny""; UPDATE students SET gpa = 4 WHERE name=""Johnny"";

There is nothing wrong with this string, afterall, it is just a string. The code will compile. What happens? Well, this string will get inserted into the pre\-existing query for the value of name.

When that string gets inserted, the following query gets run on the database

    SELECT name FROM students WHERE name=""Johnny""; UPDATE students SET gpa = 4 WHERE name=""Johnny"";

What happened? Well Johnny displayed his own name via the textbox, as a user would've expected. He also ran a second query that changed the data in the database. Well shit. We now have an insecure program, at no fault of Java, but user error.

It is an extremely simple fix \(again, prepared statements\), but there are obviously more complicated, harder problems \(such as encryption\) that exist in the same plane of user error. Java is secure, people make people mistakes. Things that were once secure, are no longer secure and have to be updated. People are lazy.

Hopefully this quickly wrote out example \(I'm sorry if there are any mistakes\) gives ya an idea of where security issues could arise.

Probably one of the nicest aspects of having a programming language in the build file was being able to generate tasks for the test permutations. There are millions of unit test executions due to running the cartesian product of the possible cache configurations. Made it really nice to escape from a DSL when necessary and have the piece of mind by letting the testing framework brute force its way through to find edge cases when refactoring.

It would be nifty to see if your dependency management APIs are mature enough to emulate the gradle-versions-plugin. That scripts Gradle's APIs to do the heavy lifting and generates an update report. It wasn't hard (a single weekend project as a new user). For me it was a nice experience to discover that things that should be easy really were because the build exposed the right concepts.

GingerMess,"The most important thing to focus on is good use of the JDK. C# and Java are pretty similar at the language level, but the libraries and methods available for doing common operations are different.

Get the basics right first. Most average or worse developers I've met haven't nailed this foundation, and end up relying on Apache, Google, and Spring libraries and frameworks to do things that are actually serviced just fine by core JDK packages. Use these libraries *to save you time when you know what you're doing*, not before!

For your specific goal, I recommend finding a good standalone HTTP server framework and focus on learning the basics. Don't go to Spring first, consider something lightweight and basic. Don't think about RxJava yet, instead focus on the basics of the concurrency and parallelism in Java. Learn how HTTP servers use these aspects to handle requests and responses, then move on from there.

_dban_,"> The root cause problem being that J2EE apps didn’t have primordial entry points where you could compose everything.

That would have been entirely undesirable for J2EE applications. The whole point of J2EE was to decompose the application into components (like servlets or EJBs) and then let the application server control how those components are made available based on application server policies. Such pooling instances, scaling with resources by distribution and passivation, container managed transactions and container managed persistence.

In short, J2EE apps didn’t have primordial entry points because that would defeat the purpose of J2EE. As the app developer, you are giving up that control, developing your components according to the J2EE rules in order to benefit from the capabilities of the app server.

This point generalizes to any frameworks. By choosing a framework, you are giving up the freedom of composing things yourself in `main()`, but you gain something in return from the framework.

The problem with the examples at the end of the article is that they don't demonstrate the reasons why someone would choose a framework in the first place.

logicISemotion,"All I see is a container with hardcoded configuration in your ```main()``` using magic methods inherited from the concrete base class that you HAVE to extend to even start the app.

So you play building blocks in code in a main() method instead of using XML or annotations + functions. Except that annotations are rather accessible and close to the code responsible to doing the action they relate with, whereas coding that in main() will make it extremely fat. Then you revert to functions like setUpFooApi() and setUpBarApi() (like how it's done in GUI's) as well as a function for each api call. So you end up with the exact same thing as the annotations + functions solution, except with more indirection, having to be super careful about the order of definition, having to read more documentation, and dealing with poorly named functions such as ```Jooby.get(String path, Route.Filter filter)```, which is actually more like a map put for a get request, or  ```Jooby.executor(String name)```, which is actually a setter.

restriction was never popular, and perceived as arbitrary. There were a 
number of subtle reasons, including the verification of invokespecial, 
that contributed to this restriction.  Over the years, we've addressed

This makes it almost impossible to couple the diagram to the code.

Not saying it can't happen with generation, but it's much more obvious to others in a team setting that you have to change the API documentation when you make a corresponding code change (i.e., it's harder to make the excuse of ""oh, I forgot about the API doc"" when it's sitting right there with the code that was changed).",1523283576.0

The author wanted to write a test case that involved reflectively accessing the `objects` field to spy on it, to verify that indeed, something got added.

This to me is against the TAO of testing.

What behavior does `objects` even support? What gets effected if I call `add` or `clear`? If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? It is the desired *effect* that I want to verify with a unit test.

network code, which is very much an edge case.

This just shows he hasn't been paying much attention to the issue. Every finite state machine implementation benefits from fallthrough. FSM is a very powerful abstraction and can be used in a wide variety of problems, not just ""low level network code"". Anything that maintains state and consumes inputs can (and often should) be modeled and implemented as an FSM—although for whatever reason many people these days use buggy ad-hoc approaches instead.

Beyond FSMs, anything where multiple inputs map to the same output/action benefit from fallthrough. E.g., processing input events where multiple inputs have the same processing logic.

Pattern matching expressions etc. have their places, but they are different constructs for different uses and should be completely separate from C-style switch statements (a mistake Kotlin makes, for example).",1523267046.0

DannyB2,"The ULTIMATE fix for this is for your application to be a web application.  People pay to subscribe to the application, and based on that they are able to use it.

You are able to shut off any single login user, or an entire customer (with all their user logins), and re-enable at any time.

Customers may find a web application more appealing because the customer is not responsible for server maintenance and backups.  (But you are!)

Customers will want some assurance about the privacy of their data.

The other major benefit of a web application over a desktop application is that it is zero install and zero maintenance.  No upgrades that must be installed across multiple workstations at the client site.  No more problems of ""Jane can't print!"".  Your web application produces PDF files, which the customer end users print.  PDFs both for reports and printed forms.  You can even make text exactly hit the boxes of preprinted forms with a single PDF designed for the form -- regardless of what printer they are using.  Or some forms can simply print out the filled-out form as the PDF, with the form boxes and all.  The user can file away all those PDFs as if they were paper.

Your application is automatically cross platform, because all you require is (1) a browser and (2) a PDF viewer / printing application.

Users can log in from anywhere, and have access to their application and data.  A cloud based application doesn't require anything more substantial than a chromebook to use.

You can put your application in the cloud on Google, Amazon or other cloud services without requiring your own dedicated servers or data center.  If you do it right, your application can scale to very large.

kevinlamonte,"Yup.  Emacs is my main editor.  I don't have my .emacs out there anywhere, but it basically sets reasonable defaults (indent 4, use spaces not tabs, syntax highlighting, Ctrl-Z for undo, etc.) that I use for both C and Java.

Every Java project has a simple file structure with a basic ANT build script, and I stick with minimal third-party libraries (log4j, jfreechart, my own stuff).  It works for me because I run Linux with multiple virtual desktops.  One desktop has an emacs window and xterm, so I just edit away and then alt-tab 'ant build' and 'java -jar build/jar/foo.jar' to get going.  Another virtual desktop has a browser open to javadocs.

I also focus on command line, [TUI based,](https://github.com/klamonte/jexer) and Swing applications.  Since I am so far removed from frontend www/HTML/CSS/JS stuff, I don't need so much infrastructure or dozens of Maven dependencies to get going.

 * The Gradle Kotlin DSL, which is nearing production-readiness, substantially improves the assistance/docs one gets through the IDE because it is statically-typed.
 * However, the Kotlin DSL does not help with the large API surface and understanding of Gradle concepts, so I have been working on improved docs and best practices.
 * However, most folks don't or won't read docs, so additional tools will help users opt-in to strictness and quality checks that enforce best practices through the tool.

Even with all that, one can think of build tools like languages: one tool will never be able to suit all needs or projects. However, I intend the broaden the audience for Gradle by making it more accessible to a wider audience.

marekgregor,"Several yers ago, I migrated 15 years old Java EE project (2. mil lines of code) from Ant to Maven. Project consists of 60+ modules, some of them very special like DLL library written in Delphi. Main motivation for migration was the total mess in ant build scripts - every module build was written differently. This ant script mess evolved incrementally by years and due to lot of people altering the scripts in no consistent way. When I was working on this migration I identified the main ""enemy"" very soon - procedural way of writing the build scripts. Migration takes 3 weeks, and finally I need to implement only one own maven plugin. And it was big success for the whole team, because complete rebuild went down from 30 minutes to approx 10 minutes simply by the fact that maven builds every module only once. Development was speeded up also, because you often work only on one module and to build new version of app - running install goal on modified module and wrapping module (ear) takes less than 1 minute. Every developer in the team very soon like it

A year ago I stepped up to 3 year old project using gradle and I experienced de-javu - procedurall hell of build scripts is back, IDEA IDE integration totally lacking due to so unstandardly written gradle scripts. I was tasked with taking the project back on the foot, developers was lost in the scripts and do not understands them.

_INTER_,"> Parameter list blacklistedLicenses is tricky to configure as some Maven artifacts use different names (e.g. Apache 2.0, Apache Apache License, Version 2.0, Apache Version 2.0, etc...) for the same license. My personal suggestion before compiling this list is to run the plugin with printLicenses set to true, note down all the license naming variation found, and then compile the blacklist from that.

This results in an odd workflow when adding new dependencies. You would have to audit the license and potentially add it to the blacklist. How about allowing whitelists and regex for filtering, it would then fail, if in blacklist or in no list. It's also not 100% secure though.

You could have this configuration:

    <blacklistedLicenses>
        <license>*GNU*</license>
        <license>*GPL*</license>
    </blacklistedLicenses>
    <whitelistedLicenses>

I like how a blacklist hit fails the build. This makes it die on the developers workstation when a dependency is added. It adds another backstop in the build server too.

I have a question, can you configure it to fail the build if the license of a dependency is not known? Internal, hobby, or other projects might not have a license block defined. Oddball dependencies with a generated POM might have the same issue. I see in the source there is a no license exclude option is that what I need to use?

EDIT: Another question, how would this work with respect to commercial licenses? I think I might need something like _INTER_ suggested with a wildcard match on a commercial license

chrisgseaton,This is called aspect orientated programming. Look up AspectJ.,1522491856.0
raghar,"One way I see it possible is to have something like:

    updating(token -> doA(token))

where `updating` call passed function, and then call `update`. Token would something like an interface, that cannot be manually instantiated and instead is available only via `updating` method - this way the only way to call `doA` would be by wrapping it with updating, which ensures update call.

With regular java that would be difficult to obtain it with some sort of list. Probably with AspectJ you could create a list of class/methods that would be wrapped with something that guarantees update call.

Basically if I needed to ensure that some sort of contract is preserved I would try to enforce it with API and types, e.g. by changing the way code is run to make `doA`, `doB` etc return more of a recipe for a computation, a composable command object pattern, that is later on run by something else - that something else could guarantee that contract holds.",1522492394.0

2. Make a wrapper class that takes an implementation of an interface that contains all needed doA methods and that delegates all calls to this implementation and adds an update call. Also only allow usage of your wrapper class in other parts of your Software. 
 
The second approach has the benefit that the wrapper can have the same interface as the wrapped implementation which makes using it feel natural. The first one makes the creation of instances more natural because you can use Standard constructors where the second one needs two constructors or a factory method ",1522492932.0
_dban_,"As others have stated, you can do this with AspectJ. But here's a way to do it that is basically how AspectJ works:

    // You can avoid the interface if you use CGLIB.

    public interface FooSpec {
        public void doA();

    }

    public class Foo implements FooSpec {
        // Must be created through factory method, because we want to ""listen"" to calls to doA, doB
        private Foo() {
        }

        @Override // implementing the spec
        public void doA() {
            System.out.println(""doA"");
        }

        @Override // implementing the spec
        public void doB() {
            System.out.println(""doB"");
        }

        public void update() {
            System.out.println(""update"");
        }

        public static FooSpec newInstance() {
            final Foo realFoo = new Foo();
            // Create a proxy which ""listens"" to all calls to FooSpec and calls update() after doA or doB 
            // Can't return Foo directly, because the proxy implements the interface.
            return (FooSpec) Proxy.newProxyInstance(
                Foo.class.getClassLoader(),
                new Class[] { FooSpec.class },
                (proxy, method, args) -> {
                    Object retVal = method.invoke(realFoo, args);
                    if(Arrays.asList(""doA"", ""doB"").contains(method.getName())) {
                        realFoo.update();
                    }
                }
        }
    }

Of course, manually maintaining a list like this is fragile, so you would have to come up with some kind of strategy, like method names patterns or annotations to identify methods that should have update called.",1522500289.0
rubyrt,"> The only way I currently understand is in the flow of doX(), I must explicitly have a call to update().

You have been given quite a bit of advice using aspect oriented programming and patterns, while really we know little about your actual use case.

If you do not intend to allow other classes to override your doX() methods then just writing `update()` at the end of the method is actually the simplest thing to do.

Even with the other approaches you need to add some the information that ""this method requires an update() after it has done its work (without exceptions)"". Regardless of how you give that information (e.g. via annotation) you have to provide it and it will not become much shorter than the `update()` statement in the last line of your method. Plus, there is no dependency on AspectJ or something else required.

If you want to allow others to override these methods then you could still use the approach with the `public final` methods `doA()` and `protected` methods that do the work.

    public class UpdateExample {
    
      public final void doA() {
        doAImpl();
        update();
      }
    
      public final void doB() {
        doBImpl();
        update();
      }
    
      protected void doAImpl() {
        System.out.println(this + "" is doing A."");
      }
    
      protected void doBImpl() {
        System.out.println(this + "" is doing B."");
      }
    
      protected void update() {
        System.out.println(this + "" updated."");
      }
    }
    
I would suggest that the cost of the added dependency to AspectJ has to be justified, e.g. by a more complex scenario that cannot be solved by the approach above, much more usage than the single class or another benefit (e.g. quickly changing many code places or inserting additional debugging code).",1522509231.0

Use only when the `new` keyword is on the right side of the assigment, i.e:

Things get more obscure if you use `var` when storing the result of a method call:

    var shit = queryForShit();

Now you can't know what the shit `shit` is until you navigate to the method definition itself, or hover over your `shit`.  As code changes over time you may get an unexpected surprise:

    var shit = fart();

Now you can't be sure if you got just a `Fart` or if it's still `Shit`. Anyway, it's not too big of a problem because the type is still static and your IDE will be able to do an ""un-var"" when you get across a `shit` var. We're just going to be more dependent on our tools to understand `shit` in code.

    ArrayList<Integer> list = getListOfNaturalNumbers();
    Iterator<Integer> listIterator = list.iterator();

Compare that with an equivalent example in C++:

    std::vector<int> vector = getVectorOfNaturalNumbers();
    std::vector<int>::iterator vectorIterator = vector.begin();
    auto vectorIterator = vector.begin();

I think it's a good feature overall, even knowing that it's usefulness is going to depend on programmers not abusing it (`var x = list.get(0).convertUpstream(3).get(4).asArray()[199];`).

atehrani,"I feel the cons outway the pros of having the var keyword. Look at these gotchas.

G5. Don't worry too much about ""programming to the interface"" with local variables.
A common idiom in Java programming is to construct an instance of a concrete type but to assign it to a variable of an interface type. This binds the code to the abstraction instead of the implementation, which preserves flexibility during future maintenance of the code. For example:

    // ORIGINAL
    List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
If var is used, however, the concrete type is inferred instead of the interface:

    // Inferred type of list is ArrayList<String>.
    var list = new ArrayList<String>();

G6. Take care when using var with diamond or generic methods.
Both var and the ""diamond"" feature allow you to omit explicit type information when it can be derived from information already present. Can you use both in the same declaration?

Consider the following:

    PriorityQueue<Item> itemQueue = new PriorityQueue<Item>();
This can be rewritten using either diamond or var, without losing type information:

    // OK: both declare variables of type PriorityQueue<Item>
    PriorityQueue<Item> itemQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();
    var itemQueue = new PriorityQueue<Item>();
It is legal to use both var and diamond, but the inferred type will change:

    // DANGEROUS: infers as PriorityQueue<Object>
    var itemQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();

    // DANGEROUS: infers as List<Object>
    var list = List.of();

G7. Take care when using var with literals.
    // ORIGINAL
    byte flags = 0;
    short mask = 0x7fff;
    long base = 17;

    // DANGEROUS: all infer as int
    var flags = 0;
    var mask = 0x7fff;
    var base = 17;",1522453163.0

kodablah,"Meh, just so long as you're consistent it doesn't matter. To your smells...

Smell 1 - That's ok if ""Service"" has a meaning in your company. The single responsibility principal is not a panacea and we have to be careful about some of this dogma in the real world. By your logic, EmailSender may violate single responsibility principal since it sends a regular email, an html email, email attachments, to multiple recipients separately, etc. Also, guess I could never have NotificationSender because it might delegate to an email sender, an SMS sender, and a chat message sender.

Smell 2 - Don't get hung up on that. Again, so long as you're consistent across your code, it's OK if the name doesn't tell you what you consider useful.

The only real code smell I personally see is the use of the prefix `I` and the suffix `Impl` as I don't appreciate unnecessary interfacing. Meaning, why even have `IEmailService` if this is probably your only impl? If it's not your only impl, you'd name the iface `EmailService` and the different impls something like `CommonsEmailService` or `ImapEmailService` or something. Premature abstraction if you ask me (unless the iface is not local and in a dependency). But that's just me.

I don't think your views are in the minority at modern shops, but looking at existing code you're going to find so many things that annoy you that it's hardly worth getting hung up on. If the benefits of refactoring > costs (rarely the case purely on names in an in-production system that already passed a code review), then refactor. I couldn't provide my opinion on what the code should look like or do or be named unless I saw all of it.",1522264473.0
ImSuperObjective2,"> Is \*Service an anti-pattern?

No.

> Smell 1: By calling a class Service, you are saying nothing more than ""I don't know what logic is important to my application"". It risks becoming a one-stop shop to chuck your logic into and the single responsibility principle is violated.

> ""Solution"": A ""Service"" is what a component provides; not a component in itself. It should be named after whatever the service does e.g. EmailSender

If the service just sends emails - fine. However in practice it's rare to have a service that performs just one verb on just one noun. Often a service is centered around managing *all verbs* for a *particular type of noun*. Or in other words, all methods for a particular type of entity (which can't be on the entity itself). In this example, maybe you want the same service to send emails, but also receive emails, so it can receive forms, forums comments, and lower-level concerns like notify you of email address bounces (or resend on failure). So it's not just an ""email sender"" in this case.

To use another example, if you have a UserService, most likely that service is tasked with registering users, confirming users, editing users, reading users, deleting users etc. You wouldn't have separate UserDeleteService typically. Not saying you can't, but typically you wouldn't.

> Smell 2: The interface name and implementation tell me nothing useful.

> ""Solution"": An interface is there to provide just enough details for a client to use the class e.g. ""List"" in the JDK. Implementations should be named after their particular implementation details e.g. LinkedList in the JDK; for a CRUDdy app, you might have a Repository interface and MongoRepository; JDBCRepository etc.

A name is there to be short, unique, and drop a hint as to the object purpose. It's not there to tell a complete and thorough story of what the component does exactly. For this you can read the methods and JavaDoc on the interface.

It seems your top problem is the fact the name ends in ""Service"". Well, if you just call it ""Email"" this name will clash with the best name for the entity the service manages: emails.

    Email email = emailService.getById(123);
    
And it's not a good idea to make your service look like *an entity*. It isn't one.

With regards to naming it a ""EmailRepository"", you've replaced one common suffix for another common suffix and I'm not sure what the improvement is supposed to be. However there's a problem: ""Service"" and ""Repository"" sit in very different places in your architecture.

A ""Repository"" is a low-level component, which concerns itself only with raw storage, and doesn't enforce the business rules of the domain, it doesn't require authentication etc. A ""Service"" is a higher-level component (possibly the highest level in the chain), which *does* enforce the business rules of the domain, typically will require authentication, and is basically as close as it gets to a public API in your domain: just bridge it to HTTP, serialize data to JSON and you're there.

So what's its called depends on what it does. Service implies a certain meaning, it's not meaningless.

BTW, in Java, we don't prefix interfaces with `I`.",1522286573.0
manzanita2,"After close to 20 years doing java, I'm pretty sick of layers for layers sake.  So I start with ""resource"" and ""dao""  layers.  I'd squish these too if I could, but dao is often used by multiple resources, so it is actually purposeful to have two layers.  But I'm not sticking a service layer in there just because.   Ok, but as the business logic dictates, i'm happy to ADD a service layer if there is some bit of logic that really needs it, and which, again, is used in multiple places.

So no, I don't think the name *Service is a code smell.  it really depends on what is IN that class or classes.  If I see a few lines which could more easily be hoisted somewhere else ( and does not have multiple calling points), then yeah code smell. Useless Ceremony.

Same thing for interfaces.  DO NOT  create an interface until you have a second class which does shares an ""interface""  with a first class.  Ok, then create the interface. Before that point you're just maintaining more code for no reason.

Essentially I don't like purpose-less abstraction.  It does not simplify things. it's just more lines of code to maintain.

raghar,"In DDD context Service is just a in-domain behavior. So XService is just something that contains some behavior for X in some bounded context.

In FP paradigm, that might be just a function. Or some specific function (like `X => Future<Y>`, or `X => Result<Y>`) - then `Service` just indicate, that whatever is inside caries domain-related logic and not any random utility.

Similar with `Repository` or `Factory`. In DDD context it just makes obvious what kind of function the code serves in context of the domain. Does it manage persistence of entities/values? Does it creates them? Is it a standalone behavior?

I agree that name should be meaningful, so personally I would name class like `EmailServices` and the services itself like `EmailServices.notifySubscribersOf(Context, ActionType)`.

jura0011,"How would you split your code. I think it's a good idea to name a class that sends emails EmalSender. Thinking about the EmailSender, it probably has only one method: send email(…). But what's with all the other things that you need to do around emails? So you'll need an EmailBuilder and an EmailTemplateCreator (OK, the last one is not a good idea, but I don't find that many elements you'd need to send emails).
I like the idea of splitting my code by some domains. For those domains, you need multiple things to do. If you have multiple things to do around some domains, how would you call the class that does all around the topic/domain? So I think the service is a good way to present this. Additional, the service is the place you would look for what happens around the domain, as that's the standard.
About the interface, depending on your project you probably have only one implementation of your services, so I would not make any interfaces. Interfaces are a good idea if you want to have multiple possible implementations where you are not interested in the implementation as long it does what you expect. I'd say creating interfaces with only one implementation within the same codebase can be seen as a codesmell. But either way, it always depends on your usage.",1522271655.0
ryuzaki49,"I mean, you just need to look at @Service annotation in Spring:

May also indicate that a class is a ""Business Service Facade"" (in the Core J2EE patterns sense), or something similar. This annotation is a general-purpose stereotype and individual teams may narrow their semantics and use as appropriate.

As I understand it, in a class with Service sufix, you would put business logic, or operations. The point of it being that this Service class should be specific and stateless.

cynicalh,"I think it depends on what your interface represents. If you've SOA and your interface represents a service, then there's nothing wrong calling it SomethingService. I like this naming because I immediately see in code completion what's what. The responsibility of this service is to send emails, you don't need to subdivide it to atoms (you'll end up with poltergeists and such). Most services in SOA are too specific (and I mean here real remote services) and it's usually counterproductive to invent an abstract universal interface (like MessagingService and then SMTPEmailService,ExchangeService etc), so it's common to just do an interface and interfaceimpl. But I'd drop the prefix I, that's probably C++ notation.

And they respect principle number one. And I want them to do things in a certain way because they feel that this way follows a principle which they understand (even if they'd follow a different principle). So when I find something in my coworker's code which I don't like, I explain him why I don't like this way of doing it. I don't ask my coworker to fix the code. I simply ask him to see my point of view. I ask him to make a decision for himself because I trust his judgment. As long as he has understood my reasoning.

**Service**

I think this is likely to be incorrect to use ""Service"" in the name of an interface because this indicates that you don't understand it's purpose. Perhaps ""Service"" has special meaning to your application and then it would make sense.

Service is fine in the name of a class, especially when it implements multiple interfaces, for example.

**I and Impl**

I think this is always a mistake. I don't think ""I"" helps readability because the reader should not care whether a piece of code interacts with an interface or an implementation. They might care which implementation is being used when debugging a particular problem but the ""I"" doesn't help there.

The ""Impl"" suggests that an interface has been extracted prematurely. Otherwise you should know how your implementation differs.

An exception might be that you are writing a library and want to allow clients to customise an implementation but can't foreseen specifically how they will do so.

> Google could owe Oracle Corp. billions of dollars for using Oracle-owned Java programming code in its Android operating system on mobile devices, an appeals court said, as the years-long feud between the two software giants draws near a close.

> The damages are likely to be hotly contested, with Oracle wanting more than the $8.8 billion it sought at the trial, and Google arguing the value is minimal, said lawyer Ping Hu, who heads the intellectual property group at Mirick O&#039;Connell in Boston.

> Oracle bought Sun in January 2010 for $7.4 billion and sued Google fewer than eight months later.

_dban_,"""Modern"" Java is whatever is being used with the latest language release, so to be a modern Java developer, keep up to date with improvements in Java.

Beyond that, Java is a general purpose programming language,so improvements in the platform track developments in industry. New concurrency models like fork/join, functional programming (lambdas and streams), reactive, web services, cloud, etc., etc.

Tools are not as important as concepts, they exist to support them. I would suggest reading up on concepts, and see what tools are typically used to implement that concept. For example, if you wanted to learn about microservices, tools commonly used for that are Docket and Spring Boot. And by no means is that definitive. You'll have people telling you to use JavaEE microprofile, Dropwizard or even micrioframeworks like Jooby. Don't worry about the alternatives, just pick one and play with it!",1522152139.0
chambolle,"There is no equivalence in Java.

A modern C++ developper is a developper who abandoned OOP, inheritance, use mainly value semantics and generics all the time

He's now able to write more general code with less line of code. The drawback is that nobody else can read the code. However, it is really nice for writing blog and two pages long code. This is also a programmer who considers that all the old code was absolutely bullshit

Fortunately, this does not exist in Java. There is just the introduction of stream, that can be seen as a new style of coding, but legagy code remains and seems to be accepted by the community

Functional programming is limited to its useful part and this is a good point.

I moved from C++ to Java for all these reasons.

ImSuperObjective2,"I love his talks as well, which is curious, because I feel Clojure itself goes a bit too far, and it's not something I use in serious projects. But his insights are real, and the way he explains them is accessible and entertaining. 

In particular this talk is very valuable, because we've had an over-simplified, over-ideologized variation of OOP drilled into our heads for too long, that talks about ""binding behavior and data"" without seeing the other side of the coin. OOP is about objects communicating through messages, not objects communicating through objects. 

Values are severely underappreciated area of software design, which is a shame, because once you leave the boundary of a process, behavior can't travel over the wire along with values. Only values can. So we better start respecting and seeing the ""value of values"", because anything else confines us to a 90s view on OOP that is desperately mismatched with the modern reality of distributed computing and remote APIs working together to a higher goal.",1522138566.0

There are many areas in which FLOSS is still far from winning, firmwares, hardware, mobile and embedded devices and so on.

Also I remember a statement from Microsoft some time ago (I believe in the wake of the Oracle/Google trial, and I'm really, really sorry that I can't link to the source because I can't remember in what context it was) which was marketing speech for ""GPL is business damaging because it does not allow us to keep our modifications to ourselves"".

- read up on the accepted syntax and coding conventions for java, especially for how you format variable and argument names.

dpash,"A few comments. Don't take them as criticisms, but as places for you to learn and improve. We were all inexperienced at one point or another, and made plenty of mistakes. Hell, at one point, I used to write functions like:

    if (condition) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }

* I'd start by separating different functionality into different packages rather than having everything in one place.
* If you're going to use Maven, don't fight the directory locations; it's well known and well understood
* Other people have mentioned following the Java style guidelines. We use this because it means that anyone can read your code and instantly understand it. Your use of CamelCase for variable names instead of camelCase will confuse people because they'll expect them to be class names. Your constants aren't UPPER_CASE, nor are your enum members. I recommend reading the Google style guide as that builds on the old Sun style guide and Elements of Java Style for newer features. 
* Do not use publicly writeable members. A case in point is Config.SetFile. Look into immutable objects and why they're preferable. At a minimum, your classes will not be thread-safe. 
* `Log` has no purpose in a world with SLF4J or even log4j. They have better features and used throughout all your dependencies. 
* You should use interfaces where possible rather than concrete classes. You can also use to diamond operator here, and let type inference work out the type of the `HashMap`. This is extra confusing because `Map.Entry` is a class in the JDK. 

    public HashMap<String, String> Entry = new HashMap<String, String>();

should be

    private Map<String, String> entry = new HashMap<>();

* `Config.deleteFile()` completely ignores any error conditions. You should pay attention to the return value of File.delete(). Better yet, use `java.nio` and `Files.deleteIfExists()` that throws an exception.

    public void deleteFile() {
        SetFile.delete();
    }

* flushEntryBuffer() has a pointless assignment of `null`. This doesn't do anything. Just assign a new `HashMap`.

This: 

    public void flushEntryBuffer() {
	Entry = null;
	Entry = new HashMap<String, String>();
    }

becomes

    public void flushEntryBuffer() {
        entry = new HashMap<>();
    }

or

    public void flushEntryBuffer() {
        entry.clear()
    }

`Map.clear()` is optional, but `HashMap.clear()` is implemented.
* I don't understand the point of `@Documented`, `@Beta`, `@NotImplemented` or `@Stable`. Just add a comment in the Javadoc or don't release libraries with functionality that's not ready for use.
* `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException` is the standard way to indicate that a function is not implemented.
* `WebProtocol` is an enum, but only has a limited selection of protocols. It's not generally useful. You can't use it with URL for example, because it doesn't include ""jar"" or ""file"" (and possibly ""classpath""). Enums are useful for closed sets. Protocol is not a closed set, because anyone can add a new protocol. For example I remember a ""spotify"" protocol that allowed your browser to launch Spotify to play a song/album/playlist if someone shared a link.
* Similarly with `HashAlgorithm`. You're missing a lot of important hash algorithms. What is someone wants to use a new algorithm when SHA-512 is broken?
* LocalPath should refer to [the system properties](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html) to find things like temp directories and users home directories. You're making huge assumptions about where a user's home directory is. Also, the code won't run on Solaris or FreeBSD or any other operating system.
* Your commit messages could do with some improvement. ""This is it."" tells me nothing about the change. Read https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ and take it to heart. If you do you'll be better than 95% of developers.
* Never use `Exception.printStackTrace();` . It writes to stdout, but most java applications use a logging framework like SLF4J to record exceptions. If you write to stdout, it won't appear in application logs, making debugging harder.
* You don't use try-with-resources. This means you fail to close resources properly. 

This:

    File FromFile = ...;
    FileInputStream FileInStrm = new FileInputStream(FromFile.toString());
    ...
    FileInStrm.close();

should be:

    File file = ...;
    try(InputStream in = new FileInputStream(file)) {
        ...
    }

This way the inputstream gets closed no matter what happens inside the block.
* You have no unit tests. Investigate JUnit. Writing tests will help you see how your library will be used, and this can often show you where it could be improved.

I'm sure I could find more issues that you could improve, but this should give you plenty of places to look into improving your skills. I highly recommend reading Effective Java by Joshua Bloch.

If you write modular code in Java 9 java-packager uses jlink to only include the parts of the VM your app needs.

The only drawback is that it can't create cross-platform executables. You need to run your build that includes running java-packager on each platform you want to create an executable for.

Then for windows, I've created a little C exe which first checks for java locations in the registry and aborts if not found.

Yes, there are packaging tools available and I'm duplicating work, but the reason I chose to build my own was for several reasons. A) I started it more than 10 years ago, various packaging tools were not as common. B) At the time it was a ""fun"", learning experience.

eniacsparc2xyz,"I am late in the party, but here it goes. There are many options: 

- For all OSes, if the application is single Uber jar, it can be distributed just as it is, the end-user can execute by double clicking at the application or by running $ java -jar application.jar. The disadvantage of this method is that it assumes that java is already installed and that the user knows how to install Java and how to run a java uber jar. The benefit is that, it requires no installation just click and run. It is a portable app by default. More info - https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/11/packing-your-java-application-as-one-or-fat-jar.html

- On Unix-like (Linux, MacOSX and other variants) for command line apps you can embed into a shell script. This method allows running java applications as ./application arg0 arg1 .... as an ordinary Unix app. - For more info see: https://coderwall.com/p/ssuaxa/how-to-make-a-jar-file-linux-executable


- On Unix, you can use a shell script to run the application. ./application.sh arg0 arg1 the shell script can contain:

         #!/usr/bin/env sh 
         java -Dprop1=val1 -Dprop2=val2  -jar ./app1-uber.jar  ""$@""

 - On Mac OSX, a dekstop app is just a directory with name ending at .app with special directory structure, to install the application the user has just to drag the application.app directory to /Applications and then double clik on it. More info on - http://arhipov.blogspot.com.br/2015/03/packaging-java-application-for-mac-os.html

- On Windows, a bat script can be used as a launcher. It is useful for command line tools apps. 

- On Windows, an native executable (*.exe) containing the shell command ""java -jar app1.jar [options]"" can be used as launcher. It can be made self contained if app1.jar is replaced by $0 or argument 0 which is the path of the running program and the jar package is appended to the end of the executable, the command line becomes ""java -jar <arg0> [options]"". This approach is adopted by http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/. I tried this way without lauch4j, but Anti Virus complains that executable is not signed. Even a .NET app.exe can be used as launcher using this technique. 

For command line tools and small standalone servers, I prefer to embed the uber jar into a shell script, for small desktop apps, I guess that is better distribute as single jar. ",1522458360.0

speakjava,"Oracle made a number of announcements last year before JavaOne about the future of JDK development and distribution. Part of this was the intention to deliver OpenJDK binaries under the GPLv2 with CPE license.  This is separate from the Oracle JDK binary, distributed under the Oracle Binary Code License.

Oracle also said that, by the end of this year, they wanted to eliminate functional differences between a binary created from OpenJDK source and the Oracle JDK binary.  To this end, they are open-sourcing Flight Recorder, Mission Control and Application class data sharing.  These will be contributed to the OpenJDK.  

As a further part of this goal, certain features are being dropped from the Oracle JDK; this is why it was announced that there will be no JavaFX (which was never part of the Java spec) or applet support (browser plugin and Java Web Start) as of JDK 11.

The slide that Oracle have used in one of their presentations shows that, as of JDK 11, the Oracle JDK binary will no longer be made available for free; only paying support customers will have access to it.  The only free binary provided by Oracle (from JDK 11) will be the OpenJDK GPL one.  These binaries will only have public updates until the next JDK is released, i.e. for six months, or two scheduled updates.  This means there is no free long-term support for the JDK as of JDK 11.  There is also no overlap of updates as we have been used to in the past.

Swing (and AWT) are part of the Java SE standard so, until that changes, they will continue to be part of Java.

We will be running Java 8 everywhere until 11 LTS comes out at which point we will start making the switch. The more frequent release cycle is good for progress, but you don't have to start using it straight away. Java 10 will be for test only so we can play around and see what things we might need to resolve for JDK 11.

I depends on what you mean by 'upgrade'.

If you ship your own JRE with your product then, yes, a conservative company will ship JRE 8 then JRE 11.

If you count on whatever JRE users have then don't be surprised if people will run your app on JRE 9 and 10 and encounter bugs.

Which, means, you might still have to QA your app on Java 9 and 10 even if your baseline is Java 8.

Even so, don't wait for Java 11 to switch to it! You should already have a plan to migrate whatever needs migrating in order to be ready for Java 11. Java 9 / 10 provides you a good test runtime to see if your migration plan and progress so far is good.

If your company sticks to LTS then it's the same as before.

There are no short term plans to drop Swing. As you know, Swing is on life-support for a long time, but since it's used to much it's still getting the occasional bugfix and such.

    System.out.println(""Found "" + warningCount + "" warnings in the log file"");
    } catch (IOException e) {

But I think that hides understanding and readability.  How is that so much better than being specific:

    Path path = Paths.get(""src/web.log"");
    try (Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(path)){
        long warningCount = lines.filter(line -> line.contains(""WARNING""))

    }

It isn't an appreciable amount of additional text (13 additional characters) but there is no confusion as to what the data types are.

You still have to know what the data type is being held by the *var* to know how to work with it such as the **Stream<String>**, so you must know what is coming back from the function calls anyway.   So what is this really buying you?

I've had to deal with some C++ code where the **auto** specifier was used and had to dig through other code to find the method being called just to figure out what the data type really was.  

So it might be great that the language/compiler can infer the type because it knows what the invoked method is returning, it isn't so easy for the developer or support team that has to dig up the source or javadocs of the method in question to know what the *var* type is.

More frequent releases contain fewer features, but those features arrive sooner.

While Lambda was definitely awesome, the delay meant that people couldn't use things like the new Date & Time API. Had this short-term release model been in place at the time, we might have gotten the new Date & Time API six months earlier with Lambda still taking the time it needed.

> Doesn't make sense for most people to either stay on 8 or wait until 11?

_INTER_,"> but computers are supposed to be smart

No. Computer are as stupid as any stone on the side-walk. What they're good at is executing the commands a programmer gives. Very fast and very accurate.

I assume you're using `&&` (and-then) and `||` (or-else) in your if-statements. These operators short-circuit. In case of `&&` as soon as any sub-expression evaluates to false, in case of `||` as soon as any sub-expression evalutates to true. This is done for performance reasons: There's no need to evaluate any subsequent expressions because they don't matter anymore for the [solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table#Logical_conjunction_\(AND\)).

If you really want to avoid the short-circuiting use the bitwise operators `&`and `|`.

> And I know there are more cases where this is apparent, is this just a normal thing with code, where you need to be EXACT with the code and telling it what to do.

Yes. There's declarative and logic programming, but it also needs to you to be exact. Have a look at the Java Streams API for example:

    Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
          .filter(x -> x > 2)
          .filter(x -> x < 9)
          .filter(x -> x % 2 == 0)

The order of the filters doesn't matter. The result is a Stream containing 4, 6 and 8.

Dantaro,"Java always examines if conditionals one part at a time, looking for the first ""true"" or ""false"" to short-circuit the operation and either evaluate the if block or not


edit:  OK, I found the exercise.  Here's a one-liner that better shows off what I'm talking about:

    public boolean mixStart(String str) {
        return str != null 
            && str.length() >= 3 
            && str.substring(1).toLowerCase().startsWith(""ix"");
    }

here we can see that the `str != null` is evaluated first.  If the string is null, we don't need to evaluate the rest of the condition.  Moving on we can see that `str.length() >= 3`, so if the string length is less than 3 we can safely return false.  Finally `str.substring(1).toLowerCase().startsWith(""ix"")` actually evaluates for the solution.

If we move any of these out of order we open ourselves to bugs.  If `str.length() >= 3` is before the null check then it can fail on a NullPointerException.  If we do the final logic before the length check we get an IndexOutOfBounds exception for strings size 1 or 0.  

The order of these evaluations matters :)

Jukolet,"We use GitLab CE, works well for us.",1521524121.0
RupertMaddenAbbott,"Jenkins because:

* We have 150+ repositories that need building and deploying.
* We have a lot of similarity between some of our builds/deployments and need to share build/deployment code between those pipelines. Shared libraries make this easy.
* We don't have control over our downstream tooling and so often need to perform strange and specific builds/deploys for legacy and 3rd party systems. This requires full control over this process so scripted groovy makes this very easy. Shared libraries let us abstract as necessary.
* We have nearly no budget beyond staff costs.

**CD Tooling**

Docker is the only tool installed on Jenkins and the various Jenkinsfiles/shared libraries specify docker images to get the right tools for the right environments.

**Pipeline Structure**

All of our pipelines follow a specific pattern:

* Build (resulting package must be appropriate for any environment)
* Automatically Deploy to first environment
* Prompt to deploy to next environment
* Repeat deploy/prompt until we get to PROD

The Build step is called for all branches and twice for all pull requests (once on the PR, and once with the branch pre-merged to master). The remaining steps are only called on master.

The different repositories supply what a ""build"" or a ""deploy"" looks like for them either directly in the Jenkinsfile if they are esoteric, or via a shared library DSL if they are common enough to be abstracted.

**Repository Structure**

We split our repositories by their release cycle so we would put multiple microservices/libraries into the same repository, if we wanted to change and deploy them always in concert.

Components that are deployed in different release cycles always version lock when they dependent on a library or service stored in a different repository (either via a package version, API version etc.). This allows us to decouple our deployments so we don't need complex orchestrated pipelines spanning multiple repositories.

**Package Types**

So far, we've used this approach for repositories such as:

* Spring Boot apps deploying to docker swarms
* Legacy Java apps deploying to dedicated VMs
* Static asset compilation going out to CDNs on Azure
* Configuration of Azure resources such as Azure API Management and Service Bus
* Java libraries deployed to an internal Nexus package manager
* Docker images deployed to an internal Docker image host",1521563022.0

ImSuperObjective2,"This laundry list of helper methods obfuscates the core purpose and API of the interface/class, and in that regard you're right - it's not a great thing to do.

On the other hand, for fluent-like APIs it aids discoverability, because if such functionality is thrown to another class, most users may never learn about it, let alone use it as intended.

So it's a mixed bag. Purely mechanically, you're absolutely right, it's a worse design. But when you consider some more of the human factor elements that go into such APIs, things get more into the shades of gray. Pros/cons on both sides.

For my own APIs I see whether you go for something like this is to be decided on a case-by-case basis.

If not, then it probably should be static or final if in a concrete class.  The default method is nice for both API discovery purposes and to allow for optimized implementations.

DannyB2,"A license key system is probably not worth it.

That said, if you must do it, make your license key system use PKI.  Your tool which generates a license key, signs it with a private key.  Your software contains the public key.  Therefore, your software is able to determine that this license key was issued by the private key, which, as you might guess, you keep private.

If possible, put the customer's name into the license key for certain types of applications.  You can show that information in a suitable place.  The about box.  (Licensed To:  Jane Doe)  If your application is, for example, an accounting system, the customer's name might appear on every web page or every printed report page.  If someone is sharing their license key, then someone else's accounting system has their name all over their reports and user interface.

Make your license key be a JSON object.  Turn it into characters.  Then the characters into bytes.  (Explicitly specify the Character Encoding to use transforming characters to bytes!  For example: UTF-8.)  Take the bytes, and encrypt them with one of your private keys.  (Yes, have multiple key pairs, and build the public parts of each key pair into your software.  Hey, it's a public key, so it's not a secret.)  Now create a binary value that specifies which key number was used to encrypt, followed by the encrypted binary.  Take all of this binary and transform it into Base64.  Now you have a block (probably several lines) of text.  You email this text to your end user.  Or give it to them on a USB stick.  Etc.  It's too long to type in.

Also, don't call it a ""license key"".  Call it an Activation Code.

In the Activation Code part of your user interface, the user can copy/paste the multiline blob of text in.

Your software Base64 decodes it back to binary.  Extracts the key number that was used, and the encrypted value.  It chooses the corresponding public key for the private key number that was used to encrypt, and it then decrypts into more bytes.  Then convert those bytes into characters using the same Character Encoding (eg, for example UTF-8).  Now you have JSON text.  Convert that into a JSON object and you have all of your licensing information.  Fields like: Customer Name, Serial Number, Product Licensed, Expiration Date (if any), Warning Period, Grace Period.  Maybe other fields.

Now the list of benefits:

You can issue an activation code that works for a limited time.  It might have a warning period of 45 days that starts warning the customer their license will expire on date such and so.  And a grace period of 45 days, after which the product would continue to operate for 45 days after license expiration -- again with warnings.

Different customers might get activation codes that never expire.  Or that are valid for different lengths of time.

You can encode additional values into the JSON value of your Activation Code.  Such as which features are enabled.  If the customer wants to buy a new feature, you email them a new activation code, they copy/paste it into the Activation Code field in their UI, and *poof* like magic their product now has new features enabled.

Hope that helps.",1521824337.0

o_O. Ehm. No. Unless you really really really know how to configure your ""sandbox"" database, chances are that it's not so sandbox after all. You're planning on using H2, for instance?

I'll leave it up to your imagination what could happen next.

I'm not saying it isn't possible. http://sqlfiddle.com is an example where this has been done. But I'm sure, it is really well configured and sandboxed correctly.

So co locations are a must have in my opinion, at least for us it improved the atmosphere and also the business side was usually happy as the performance during and after the co location even increased.

In general, a business doesn't even need to consider hiring remote workers until they have exhausted the local talent pool. Only then would these types of places put up ads to hire remote workers to broaden their search. It's usually a last resort, so there aren't as many remote jobs as compared to local jobs.

Even then, not everyone is cut out for remote work. It's great for those of us that are good communicators, highly disciplined, and do not need a lot of social interaction. Many people over-estimate their own abilities in these areas.

Actually testable code with proper dependency injection does not appear before the 1h mark. After watching this video, I at least know what kind of job I never want to do for a living.

**tl;dw:** Try to get decent test coverage and start with the easiest parts. Do whatever is necessary to make code testable, but only use automated refactoring and do not change public APIs to make sure you don't break anything. If dependencies are not injectable, subclassing the class under test and overriding protected methods you introduced yourself is ugly, but okay.
Once your test coverage and understanding gives you enough confidence, move to proper dependency injection and refactor the hell out of everything so you won't bore-out in your job before Java 11 comes out.

I think the answer is going to require figuring out situational environmental questions I.e  how much memory can / am I willing to use.

If you can't use much memory and you have lots of data to store, you would need to probably go out to files (ugh slow).

The other way round, well I would use a hash map but pre load it with X values at start up. To find x, I would figure out how much extra memory I want my app to use, let's say 10mb. Then divide the 10mb by the data size of what I'm storing in the hash map (it's a rough estimate and it's trickier to figure out for objects). ",1520890904.0

m_takeshi,"I don't think there's a general answer to your question - and if it's an interview question, you're better off asking the interviewer for more details.

For instance, imagine a cache for storing ints (both as cache keys and values), and your jvm has pointer size P and word size W so the object header size will be O = P + W (bytes)

( I'm figuring as I go, so don't expect much structure to my answer )

If you know an aproximation of your cache keys (say, all within a bound from N to M), the array is gonna cost you:
O + 4 {array length field} + (M-N) * 4 {array content}
 
For hashmaps, the cost is not so easy to calculate, but here goes an aproximation (for jdk8):

Object Header: O
AbstractMap: P {keyset pointer} + P {values collection pointer}
HashMap: P {entryset pointer} + 4 {load factor - a float} + 4 {mod count} + 4 {size field} + 4 (threshold field) + P { entries array }

Each entry on the entry array will be:
O + 4 { hash field } + W { key field } + W { value field } + W { next field }

However, because each key and value are boxed ints, their size is:
O + 4 { value field }

The entries array (its size will be 1.3 * (M-N) in the default 0.75 load factor):

O+4{array length field} + (M-N)*P*1.3 + (M-N) * ( (O + 4 + W + W +W) + (O + 4) + ( O + 4 ) )

putting it all together for a 32bit jvm (W = P = 4) and using X=(M-N)

cache array total size: 
O + 4  + (M-N) * 4 
12 + X * 4 

hashmap array total size aproximates to:
O + 4*P + 4 * 4 + O+4 + (M-N)*4*1.3 + (M-N) * ( (O + 4 + W + W +W) + (O + 4) + ( O + 4 ) )
52 + ceil(X*5.2) + X * 48 ~> 52 + 53*K

(i didnt proof any of these, but with this information you know how to calculate)

For 64bit jvms, W is 8 and P is either 4 or 8, depending on wheter or not you have CompressedOOPS enabled and working 

Basically, for fully populated caches within a certain bound, its not worth it to use HashMaps. 

In general, the size function for hashmaps is looks like this:

2 * O + 4*P + 20 + ceiling ( 1.3333 * ( X ) * ( P ) ) + ( X ) * ( (O + 4 + W + W +W) + K + V)

where X is the number of entries, K is the size of the keys (boxed if primitives) and V is the size of the values (again, boxed if using primitives)

( at this point, I'm not really sure if my post makes you even more confused, but its too late now )

If you have to ask this question, there is a 99.999% chance that you don't need it. Is it going to run on a server? Use a HashMap. Is it going to run on a desktop? Use a HashMap. Do you have specialized needs which require fine-tuned memory and CPU utilization (just in case: In most cases, you don't), then profile the application with different settings.

If this question is of academic nature, the best way is to profile it to find out which options do perform better. You could *calculate* the memory usage of the HashMap and the array by hand, but it is quite cumbersome and error prone, also it might differ between JVMs.",1520931880.0

nehaldamania,"My favourite is Eclipse for Java Development. I also like IntelliJ. But, I am more comfortable with Eclipse as I have used it more than any other IDE, so muscle memory. I feel Eclipse is a lot under-appreciated for what it is. Few features like Mylyn's task-focused interface (http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/), where I can quickly change task and see only the code changes related to same and integration with outside tools makes it a complete developer workflow tool. Few other Projects like Oomph (https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.oomph) helps one to create a complete customized IDE specific to a project with all the necessary plugins and code loaded. Performance and UI are also improving with each release. It is almost at par with any other IDE if not better for Java Development. Being Open Source, I appreciate it more. Most of the time, it all depends on what one has become comfortable with. As feature-wise, both(IntelliJ and Eclipse) have almost same features with one topping other in some areas. ",1520686233.0

nqzero,"i mostly use netbeans for java on linux, and i prefer to do most non-coding work on the command line, eg git, and to a degree even building and running with maven. things i like about netbeans:

* handles having dozens of java projects open at the same time seamlessly
* core editor is rock solid, eg i have a macro to scroll up 10 lines that's much faster in netbeans than intellij
* great maven support and most maven projects generate zero ide-specific files
* decent support for other languages (though if i'm doing serious javascript for a few days i use webstorm - the code understanding tools are better than in nb)
* i don't use it often, but i love the code diff/merge tool when i need it (though i've never compared with intellij on this)

tbh, i've never given eclipse an honest try - the couple times i've installed it i've gotten frustrated configuring it and given up.  intellij has more bells and whistles than netbeans, but for the core features that i use (basic editor, maven, find usages, navigation, opening maven projects) 99% of the time i find netbeans to be a bit faster / smoother

_INTER_,"We're using Eclipse at work. Incredible frustrating at times. I don't think it is meant to work with git. Every time you switch to a release branch it has to rebuild many of our 250+ modules (idk if thats any better with IntelliJ). The installation and update also requires atleast a half-day of effort. Many plugins are broken or not the exact right version and you can't work without plugins effectively. Dark theme is broken and ugly.

There are a few good parts though and that are subjectively better than in IntelliJ.

From within Intellij, I open files in external editors like Vim and Emacs for fast/efficient text editing. Always have those editors open anyway. Emacs is open for at least orgmode + magit and Vim is open for all kind of files.

Do not believe there is such a thing as “best IDE”, it is more a combination of tools. For example, I’m using AppCode to write code, but I debug code in XCode. For me the great thing about Vim and Emacs is the freedom to customize really everything. We are all programmers right, so why not extend your editor with your own code?",1520724718.0

desrtfx,"Java's seemingly slower pace is on purpose because Java is an *enterprise language*. 

There are codebases with several million lines that handle business critical applications. Having a fast release/feature cycle can way too easily break such applications and administrators of large organizations would need to constantly update - which is near impossible for the places where Java really shines.

Most people only see Java as a consumer language, but that point of view is completely wrong. 99% of Java are used where ""normal"" people don't get anywhere near. In large corporations and enterprises; on servers in high security areas. Exactly these use cases benefit from the slower pace of Java. Code written for previous versions will run with newer versions without breaking anything.

If you want a language with a faster pace, stay away from Java.

Java is a stable, mature, well established enterprise grade language with probably the largest ecosystem available. It's not going to become obsolete in the near future.

ObscureCulturalMeme,"Good.  Java 9 introduced new stuff, but also broke a lot of other stuff without giving the world time to gain experience with the fixes and work-arounds (all of which are the new stuff).

They ought to have introduced the new stuff in 9, and made the bad stuff emit warnings but still work by default.  Java 10 could then make the bad stuff break by default, but continue to work with funky JVM options or the use of the entirely new language features added in 9.  Then 11 could remove the funky transition JVM options.

Instead, they skipped the compatibility step, and went with ""these classes the ivory tower doesn't like but never have caused any warnings before are now broken.  Unless you use these new module language features which you've never seen before, and which only a subset of the userbase wanted, and which your enterprise-wide tools don't recognize.

AggravatedAgrajag,"A lot of my personal stuff, both early and current, has been simple programs to automate stuff I don't want to do manually. 

An early one I took great pleasure in was to prove one of my math teachers wrong... She claimed that we couldn't use calculators to solve a particular type of problem because she wanted to see the answer in fraction form with our work shown, and a calculator would only give us the final answer and in decimal. So I wrote a program on my calculator that solved the problem, and output each step of the way in fraction form.

Another early one was a solver for the ""computer hacking"" in Fallout 3, which was very tedious until I improved that skill.

AkirIkasu,"Hmm. The first one I can remember is a simple one that asks for your name and tells you hello with your name. 

As someone who has been programming for a while now, let me give you a little piece of advice. When you are learning how to code, the important thing is never *what* you are trying to acomplish, it's *how*. Computers are inanimate objects with zero intelligence, so you have to tell it what to do every step of the way. 

If you're learning by yourself (and also assuming you have the time for it), I would strongly recommend to hold off learning the flashier things like GUIs and web frameworks and instead focus on design patterns. The power of any modern programming language is not necessarily going to what libraries are available for it, but in how it allows you to design your software. It's best to learn some good design patterns before you jump into software development.",1520635711.0

Functional code tends to be easier to reason about  it ultimately describes **what you’re trying to do** (as opposed to imperative, which describes “how you’re doing it”) and due to functional operators (map, flatMap, reduce, etc.) operations are almost always more succinct than their imperative counterparts (conditionals, loops, etc.). 

Functional approach is taking the programming world by storm. It’s definitely a mindset switch with some initial cognitive overhead but once you’re familiar with it, it’s both addicting and productive.

Edit: To address the other part of your question... extremely simple flows or logic might not benefit from FP. But anything complex, especially asynchronous flows, will benefit from FP with observables, and as the Netflix team addressed, it can be more performant than using callbacks or futures as well.

Trailsey,"My experience to date (anecdotal) is that it's used in a limited fashion, and most java devs are still coding imperatively.

I like it, and I think the reactive style has a lot to offer in many scenarios.  I still think java land has a ways to go before we can get a full reactive stack (reactive jdbc for instance) but a lot of progress is being made rather quickly.  I would expect this to become more normal over the next 2-5 years or so.",1520538751.0
DevIceMan,"I started doing FP in Java for a couple years.  There's quite a lot that can be achieved which is far less verbose than the equivalent in non-FP Java.  Unfortunately, I found that once you get past Lamdas and Streams, there's not much depth.

I started working on several FP libraries for Java, including some testing libraries and one which did something similar to Scala's match-case statements.

The problem I consistently faced was a lot of the stuff I wanted to do, and most of the FP libraries I was trying to create, were features natively supported in Scala and dome much better than I could hope to achieve in Java.

I currently work mostly in Scala, so I haven't really looked back much since.

> I've used little bits here and there but it doesn't seem all that useful or pretty.

I've taught a good number of people how to use a lot of Java's FP features.  The people I have run into who say similar things to what you said, I've always given up on teaching fairly quickly.  If you're looking for reasons to hate it, you'll find them.

Java FP is a tool; it's better or worse at accomplishing different tasks and it's easy to misuse.  There wouldn't have been any point for the FP tools to be added to Java if they didn't have legitimate uses.  Given Java's history, they're actually extremely biased towards the ""don't add things"" when it comes thing things like functional programming or advanced language features.",1520565184.0

everybodyhatesclowns,"I try to avoid shared (or, worse, global) mutable state as far as possible.

Local mutable state is fine.

    for (int i=0; array.length; ++i) { sum += array[i]; } // sum is locally mutable
    
    ArrayList<Foo> tmp = new ArrayList();
    // initialise tmp
    for (Foo elem : tmp) { elem.doStuff(); }
    // tmp doesn't leak anywhere
    return;

I get very nervous when all of these are true:

 - an object is mutable
 - an object is shared between objects (or referenced from a `static` field, etc)
 - at least two of the referencing objects interact with the object (for instance, a collection that holds mutable objects won't call any methods on them)

# Semantically

Thinking about the semantics of mutability, I believe that the ideal choice between immutability or mutability is often apparent by thinking about **information flow**: a mutable object can be seen as an object that can transmit information between all objects that share it -- it's an N-to-N communication channel.

Example:

    class MutableInt { int x; }
    class Foo {
      MutableInt mInt;
      Foo (MutableInt mInt) { this.mInt = mInt; }
      void inc() { mInt.x++; }
      void print() { System.out.println(mInt.x); }
    }

I can now use aliasing to implement communication:

    MutableInt theInt = new MutableInt();
    Foo f1 = new Foo(theInt);
    Foo f2 = new Foo(theInt);
    // send message from f1 to all holders of theInt:
    f1.inc();
    f2.print();
    // send message from f2 to all holders of theInt:
    f2.inc();
    f1.print();

Problems arise when you ""send"" informations to recipients that you did not intend. In Java practise, there are two good ways to deal with that issue:

 1. keep N as small as possible (in other words: keep mutable state unaliased or local)
 2. use immutable objects to prevent sending of messages

Edit:

Option 2. is easier to verify: you can check a class for whether it's immutable by ""just"" looking at the class itself (slightly harder for when there's inheritance). Option 1. is harder to verify since you have to look at all the code an object is passed to. I think that this is not a general principle in programming languages, it just happens to be so in Java.",1520601526.0

You want the ability to controll every concurrent ""thing"". A DBA needs to know the currently running query and the ability to kill it in a sane way.

 * Some intermediate subheaders could help. Also the blog format has no width limit, making reading in neutral zoom hard (long long sentences).

  ""a single instruction, popcntd, which is exposed as an intrinsic""; ""code above is intrinsified to the instruction popcntd"" I'm sure you know what an intrinsic is, but the article fails to express that clearly. A link to the wiki article, or OpenJDK wiki might have helped. I would prefer ""generated by the compiler via an intrinsic"" to ""exposed"", and replace ""code above"" with ""method above"".

This sounds a bit like you'll hit walls once you try to do solve real problems with this library. Perhaps I was bitten too often by the temptation to pick the easy solution first, and by the false promises of simplicity. The last 10% of a project sometimes end up eating 50% of the time, not least because of wrong library choices at the beginning.

So, serious question: Has anyone used this library and can share some experiences on how it performs in edge cases and complex situations? Is it extensible enough or replaceable once you hit a wall?

Also, does it mature in a developer friendly way? How is backwards compatibility and deprecation handled?

Author should read the cathedral and the bazaar IMHO. Reliability comes from having small specialised tools that a lot of people use. Not from ""being small"".

In these kinds of 'normal' workloads Spring is pretty much never the bottleneck. Instead it's typically the IO overhead of going to a database or another service that's taking most time. 

If you have a very a-typical workload of returning something from memory that almost never changes, and do this often then sure, such a benchmark might be worthwhile. But in most projects developer productivity is a much higher bottleneck and there it's really hard to beat Spring. ",1520240044.0

Also, some frameworks are highly tweaked for this kind of benchmarks, but rather slow in real world applications, e.g. ASP.NET Core and its notorious slow DB access.

Lastly, Spring 5 with WebFlux is asynchronous, so should scale much better. But is probably slower with less concurrency. And JDBC is still synchronous only.

What these benchmarks also don't take into account is developer productivity. Hardware is cheap, developers are expensive. I would bet Spring ranks extremely well in terms of productivity compared to a lot of the other libraries in there appearing near the top.

The language you use is just a tool to translate your ideas to paper that gets gobbled up by the compiler/VM. What's more important is your grasp of the data structures and algorithms for the problem space and secondly your grasp of the tools to get your ideas to production. This includes an IDE, version control, testing frameworks, deployment and integration, OS tools like bash, sed, awk, grep, etc...

I will give you an example, my last job I interviewed for they gave me a programming assignment to grab data from a weather site as a csv file and parse the data to answer questions like hottest day this week and day with the largest deviation in temperature, etc.. They give you a couple hours to write it and then they look at it and discuss your code (data structures, algorithms, etc...) Now, this is a company whose flagship product is written in Java but the interview assignment can be written in any language. I chose Perl at the time as that was the code I used most often and most recently at the time. I got the Job and a few years into the job I was asked to help interview the newest job applicant who made it past the interview gauntlet to the final coding problem (same problem.) When it was time to review his solution I saw he wrote it as a Bash shell script! We hired him too. 

It almost is never predicated on the language you know. It's more predicated on the problem domain and problem solving skills. That and familiarity with production level tools like VC, CI, TF, and working with Teams via Agile methodologies, etc... 

Build up your portfolio on Github/Gitlab. Show experience with tools like Eclipse, Junit, Maven, Jenkins. Show experience with a production OS like Linux and all it's tools.

Java impresses me more each release. Both in the language and capabilities of the JVM. At the language level generics and lambdas are super powerful, and bring lots of interesting options for new APIs. At the API level each new release does a great job at standardizing best practices from the best libraries into the stdlib, e.g. Java streams, immutable collections, javax.inject, CallableFutures, and executors have all made significant impact on the collective idea of best practices in the language. Upcoming Java 9 support for reactive streams is another great step.

Starting from Java is a good idea. I think you should try to complement that with becoming what they call a 'full stack' developer. 

Nowadays, I think most applications that matter somehow run on web platforms and or mobile devices. Such an app is not typically written in just one language it will probably have a 'back-end' and 'front-end' (or even multiple front-ends for different kinds of devices).

The back-end... has a very good chance of being a Java application running on AWS or something like that. And it may use modern Java framework like spring-boot (if you are lucky).

And the front-end will typically be some mix of JavaScript / HMTL and CSS. This is the 'UI' part that faces the users. The back-end deals with the databases and business logics.

If you develop all the skills to develop such an app... with the back-end written in Java and tied to have nice HTML / CSS / JavaScript frontend in the browsers... employers will be tripping over eachother to hire you.

That's ok, you need just more experience with it. If you feel overwhelmed with options, ask yourself what kind of work interests you more: frontend (JS), backend/Android (Java), embedded/systems level (C), data science/machine learning (python). You will find learning what you like much easier.

MrMannWood,"The key piece here is to bite off manageable sections of work. You're starting from scratch in more ways than one, so it's important to win early and often. Otherwise you'll likely get discouraged and give up.

Have you used a modern IDE? I used eclipse when I was in school, and it was ok. Certainly didn't turn me into coding though. Go download IntelliJ, community edition. Get it started and create a simple hello world program.

Next, I recommend learning how dependency management works. Basically, it's the system that ensures you have all the proper jars in your classpath so that you don't have to have all source, and don't have to manually manage the versioning. For that, I recommend maven. IntelliJ has support built in, and there's lots of tutorials online. Easiest way to get going is to create a new project in IntelliJ, and choose maven in the wizard. It's really that simple. From there, write a simple program that does e.x. string comparison with Apache Commons. Google ""maven central Apache String Utils"" to get the dependency.

You'll probably be wanting to get a little more at this point. Try connecting to your database! There's sql drivers for Java that are pretty powerful and well documented. DON'T GO CRAZY! No hibernate or anything. Just a connection, a main method, and a simple query with a prepared statement. After that's running, maybe get user input and insert a row.

Now for the fun stuff! Use spring boot to set up a project for web (there's really good tutorials for this). Again, nothing fancy. Just get a simple hello world webpage up.

Now start learning about dependency injection. Spring has this built in, and it's really powerful. There's plenty of tutorials out there, but s good place to start is to just create a ""hello service"" that is injected into your web controller. It should return the content for the page. (Probably just ""hello world."")

Alright! You now have all the skills to create a backend! This is where the real fun starts. Figure out your endpoints, and build them. At this point you should have the vocabulary to know what to look for. Some key words of note: JSON and REST.

I have no real advice on creating a web or applet front end. Most of my UI experience is in Android. However, once you're this far you'll know what to search for.

GridDragon,"Spring Boot is my Go-To unless I have reason to choose something else. It covers most of the stack really well. It also runs out of the box basically configured unless you're doing something really weird/custom. If you follow SOLID design it works really well though.

My last several projects I've spun up through https://start.spring.io/

Name your project. Define it's maven coordinates, select the modules you want included (advanced mode gives you a full list of all the available options), and it gives you a pre-configured pom file you can import into your IDE. I basic REST client can be up and running inside an hour, and it can be built on very easily to build out all the features you need.

Regarding your list:

* Bundler: I prefer Gradle. Spring appears to favor Maven, but both work.
* Testing: JUnit with AssertJ. AssertJ just gives better error reporting, and the asserts are more intuitive.
* Authentication: OAuth is nice if it fits your use-case. Most of the headaches can get outsourced to a third party authentication client (Facebook, Google, GitHub, loads more). I used Scribe: https://github.com/scribejava/scribejava
* REST: Spring Web or Jersey. I have more experience with Spring Web, but others on my team swear by Jersey.
* NoSQL: I've mostly used DynamoDB through AWS. Otherwise I've used MongoDB configured by SpringBoot. I'm not sure which driver it uses, but it works out of the box.
* ORM: Java Persistence API. Again I use Spring's JPA module.
* Dependency Injection: Spring... you probably saw that one coming.
* Network Clients: I don't have a favorite here. I do more really light HTTP work, so Java's HttpClient works in most cases. Jersey's HttpClient is a nice abstraction if you're doing more advanced stuff.

If I were to setup a simple REST server to support an application I'd do the following:

Use Spring Initializer (https://start.spring.io/) to create a new Spring project with Web, Security, and JPA modules selected along with your favorite DB implementation. Download it as as a Gradle project.

That comes pre-loaded with JUnit for testing, but I'd add AssertJ to make my life easier.
Finally if needed, I'd include Jersey to get access to the Jersey HTTP client if I need to make additional REST calls from the server.

Assuming you're going to be working with JSON requests and responses from your app. I'm a big fan of Gson for JSON parsing, but Jackson is also popular (https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)

Auth is provided by Spring, which is great, and testing in Grails uses [Spock](http://spockframework.org/), which is also nice.

Check out their handy [app forge](http://start.grails.org/) to get started, and try some [tutorials](http://guides.grails.org/index.html).",1519700776.0

dcsohl,"NoSQL is a really broad term ... it covers a huge range, from document-oriented databases like MongoDB, to key-value stores like Redis, to graph-databases like Neo4j ... and many other styles of data storage as well. For most of your other requirements, it's enough to say ""REST"" and people can recommend stuff right off the bat.

,"It depends on complexity.

Spring boot has the must support for any java framework and I wouldn't use anything else. I have and regretted it.

Use an orm. Not an expert in that. I don't know about NoSQL orm stuff. I also use elasticaeach and solr. I've used orms and rolled custom and always wished I'd have used an orm. 

Data storage depends on requirements. Nothing wrong with MySQL (mariadb) or postgresql if the domain makes sense for it.

I use maven and not gradle but it doeant much matter. Use whatever is easier. Its not going to make much difference so use what's easier for you.

The newer junit is good. I've just been using assertj and I've liked that.

Having used a bunch of web servers I still use tomcat but it's not really important. You want to spend ur time developing and not deploying. Use whatever ur most comfortable with.

My big suggestion is to use restful ajax to react and avoid any server side rendering. Use redux and sagas. The extra complexity upfront is well worth it later. Again it depends on your complexity and desired maintainability.",1519708437.0

theHorrible1,I have recently started using ActiveMQ with STOMP.js (mqtt also supported) for websockets in my React apps. Makes it super easy to push data to react from any language or app.,1519708040.0
eitch0000,"I would like to point you to https://strolch.li

It is a different framework to the Spring and other similar types, as the model is defined as an abstract model, where you always have the same three types of objects: Resources, Orders and Activities. The fields are mapped as Parameter objects, of which all the primitives are available.

The nice part about this framework is, that you can be up and ready in a matter of minutes, and start building your project immediately in that you open your favourite XML editor and start modelling your data. 

Once your data is defined, you write your business logic in the form of Services, Commands and Queries. There are many predefined services and commands to manipulate the object model, so that you write your own services when you need to enforce special business rules.

Through the use of Policy objects, you decouple algorithms from your object model, so that at runtime you can change the behaviour, or easily implement different behaviour depending on your customer. For instance you might have a simple billing service which performs a few preparatory steps, and then calls the configured billing policy to execute the billing depending on the customer, or the warehouse, etc.

And of course persistence is as simple as configuring the persistence handler, pointing to your RDBMS and then setting the mode to CACHED. For you as a developer there is no more thinking in terms of SQL etc., as this is completely hidden from the developer. There is even a simple file persistence layer if you are running on IoT.

The runtime can be just about anything. Usually it is run inside an Apache Tomcat instance as a webapp, but this is just because a WEB UI was always required. You could just as well use Java SE and start the server using a main class. Calling services in the Strolch container is usually rest, but also this is totally up to you.

Strolch is being actively developed, we have quite a few ideas on how to enhance the API. There is a Polymer Inspector component which makes it easy to see and manipulate the actual data. We are redesigning the query API to be much easier to understand, a new SQL style query API is nearly finished which makes it easy to perform queries from a client e.g. the browser. 

If there are questions, then don't hesitate to ask.

Yes, Strolch is very different, but the concept has come out of the planning and execution segment, and has been refined over the years until it has become what it is today.",1519711810.0

DannyB2,"Senior Software Developer.  Recently recognized for 35 years service.  I build a commercial specialized web based accounting application (SaaS).

On the side I do several things.

I build Java programs on Raspberry Pi to control chained 8x8 LED matrix, where each 8x8 LED block is controlled by a single MAX 7219 chip.  I have a Java implementation that can drive these chained modules on a Raspberry Pi 1.  Naturally it would work much faster on a Pi 2 or Pi 3.  It does use concurrent threads (even on single core Pi 1).  One thread empties queues of command messages to 7219 chips, forms a command chain and then rapidly clocks these bits out using SPI.  One thread drives a rapidly running snake on a module, with another similar thread with a different length snake and different movement rate (just to prove they are different) on another module.  One of these 8x8 LED modules is actually a 7-segment 8 digit display (also with MAX 7219 chip) and another thread rapidly shows milliseconds as fast as can possibly be updated on this display, while another thread spins four segments in the upper part of the leftmost digit of the 8 digit display.  The whole thing looks very active while running.  But it runs on a Pi 1 without problem.  So I was pleased.  By snake, I mean a length of lit LEDs that moves, when it bumps into an edge, or sometimes randomly, it changes direction and continues.  The other lit LEDs in the snake follow the ""head"" LED.

I also build a big Swing desktop application for a friend.

As others have said, while Android does use Java to write programs, it actually isn't running on a Java VM - it is running on an alternative VM called Dalvik VM. This means that Java FX applications (which are designed to run on the Java VM) won't run on Android, so you probably need to pick one and learn the ins and outs of programming frontend apps in the respective environments.

nutrecht,"I think the reasoning is much too black and white. Simply the quality of education is very low in general. If I look back and the Dutch university I studied at; they lowered the bar an enormous amount because of the controlling board figuring that a drop out percentage of 70% was way too high. They had to reach the global average of 20% or so. 

A lot of the 'hard' classes were either made easier or dropped altogether. What's even worse; most programming classes were turned into group project classes where you were working with 6 people on an assignment instead of just solo. You know how these 'teams' work; one or two people doing all the work with the rest coasting along.

Here in Holland the economic incentive for schools is just to have as many people graduate as possible. They don't get the government funding unless you graduate. So if you get stuck one something they often give you alternative assignments. Get stuck on implementing a certain data structure? Write a nice story about how that DS applies to the 'real world' instead. That kind of stuff.

So what you end up with is a ton of people graduating that should never have gotten past the first year. This is the primary reason that a lot of companies, especially smaller ones, don't want to hire recent grads anymore. The people who used to fail in their first year in school now fail in their first year trying to get a job. They just moved the filter to after you spent all your money on an education.

This:

    UrlEncoder.encode(""foo"", Encoding.UTF8)

Instead of this:

    try {
      UrlEncoder.encode(""foo"", ""UTF-8)

DrFriendless,"I worked on a distributed Java app for 17 years. As I was there at the beginning, I built in CPU and memory measurements every minute, and eventually added tools to graph what we knew. We could see the used memory line approach the available memory line, and shortly after that the CPU line would start to increase, and some time after that the measurements would be interrupted indicating that the system had crashed.

We used a homegrown asynchronous buffer implementation, where would keep tasks to be acted on by processing threads. Each buffer had a name, and if it started growing suspiciously we'd start logging the sizes of all of the buffers. So when we saw the used memory line go up, we'd look for increasing values in the buffers as well.

We had periodic full stack dumps, so if the buffers were increasing we would often get lucky and have a stack of the thread that was supposed to be processing that buffer, so we could see where it was stuck.

We also monitored every SQL statement or Hibernate query we executed, and if it took more than 2 seconds we'd log that. Similarly for RPCs and other calls out to external services. So if the thread looked like it was doing something, it might anyway be leaving a trace of slowness. It was always nice when one VM reported ""slow RPC"" and another reported ""took too long to process RPC"", so we could track the slowness across processes.

We also added logging of page opens and closes, so if we noticed a period of high CPU or memory leakage, we could figure out what was being done for that time period. I added two search and text highlight capabilities, so we could search for two different messages and try to match their behaviour. That was nice when we would notice that whenever the user opened such a page, an error would be reported in the logs a minute later.

Over the years, the graphing tool gained all sorts of capabilities, such as being able to graph O/S performance logs in a separate pane, and being able to open multiple files and zoom and search all of them at once. It was truly a wondrous system which I dearly miss.

You can use whatever you want :) If you want to build your own web server from scratch because you enjoy doing it, by all means go for it. And there's also tons of 'small' frameworks that handle some parts of what spring does.

For me personally I tend to stick to Spring Boot for personal stuff simply because it's convenient, unless I have a specific goal of working with something else (Vert.x for example).

What’s new in Java 10: Episode 2

Java 10 is coming in **March** 2018. This release contains quite a lot of enhancements in ***the*** JVM. But ***it*** looks like JDK users are mostly interested in one particular update in ***the*** Java ***language*** – type inference ***for*** declarations of local variables with initializers. ***Besides updates to the Java language*** and JVM, Java 10 contains another update which together with the six-month release model has been bothering ***the*** Java community for several months.

Here is a digest of the rest of ***the*** main features in Java 10 which weren’t covered in the previous post. Enjoy!

Time-Based Release Versioning

Just to make it easy and clear from the very ***beginning, here*** is how JEP 322 defines the new ***Java version format***:

`[1-9][0-9]*((\.0)*\.[1-9][0-9]*)*`

I should probably switch to the next topic because it’s hard to add anything else here. But let me try. It allows the version to be of arbitrary length, but the first four elements are assigned specific meanings. Here is what the JEP authors say:

>`$FEATURE.$INTERIM.$UPDATE.$PATCH`

>$FEATURE — The feature-release counter, incremented for every feature release regardless of release content. Features may be added in a feature release; they may also be removed, if advance notice was given at least one feature release ahead of time. Incompatible changes may be made when justified. (Formerly $MAJOR.)

>$INTERIM — The interim-release counter, incremented for non-feature releases that contain compatible bug fixes and enhancements but no incompatible changes, no feature removals, and no changes to standard APIs. (Formerly $MINOR.)

>$UPDATE — The update-release counter, incremented for compatible update releases that fix security issues, regressions, and bugs in newer features. (Formerly $SECURITY, but with a non-trivial incrementation rule.)

>$PATCH — The emergency patch-release counter, incremented only when it’s necessary to produce an emergency release to fix a critical issue. (Using an additional element for this purpose minimizes disruption to both developers and users of in-flight update releases.)

>The fifth and later elements of version numbers are reserved for use by downstream consumers of the JDK code base. The fifth element may be used to, e.g., identify implementor-specific patch releases.

This version format is suitable for the six-month release model which caused a lot of discussions in ***the*** Java community. Here is what the JEP owners say about it:

>Under the six-month release model the elements of version numbers vary as follows:

>$FEATURE is incremented every six months: The March 2018 release is JDK 10, the September 2018 release is JDK 11, and so forth.

>$INTERIM is always zero, since the six-month model does not include interim releases. We reserve it here for flexibility, so that a future revision to the release model could include such releases and say that JDK $N.1 and JDK $N.2 are compatible upgrades of JDK $N. As examples, the JDK 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 releases were, in essence, interim releases, and would have been numbered 4.1 and 4.2 under this scheme.

>$UPDATE is incremented one month after $FEATURE is incremented, and every three months thereafter: The April 2018 release is JDK 10.0.1, the July release is JDK 10.0.2, and so forth.

The new release versioning also caused the following changes:

* new version strings

* added two new system properties `java.version.date` and `java.vendor.version`

* updated Runtime.Version API

The JEP owners put ***out*** a lot of information about the new release versioning. You can find ***it*** in JEP 322.

***Removal of*** the Native-Header Generation Tool (javah)

How many of us ***have*** ever run `ls ${JAVA_HOME}/bin`? You may be surprised ***by*** the result. ***The*** `bin` directory contains a bunch of tools which come with ***the*** JDK. One of them is `javah` which is used to generate JNI header files if you define native ***methods*** in your code. How many of us use JNI?

Generating JNI header files has been supported by `javac` since Java 8, so `javah` looks a bit redundant. By the ***way***, there is Project Panama which may replace JNI ***entirely*** and add more interesting stuff.

The JEP authors don’t say much about removing `javah`. There is nothing much to say though. See JEP 313.

Additional Unicode Language-Tag Extensions

Do you know what a language tag is? Most of ***us have*** probably seen it before. For example, `en-GB` and `en-US` are language tags. As you can see, a language tag may contain several elements which are called subtags. Here `en` means English. `GB` and `US` mean a region, so it’s Great Britain and United States accordingly. In other words, `en-GB` and `en-US` mean British and American English. Language tags are defined in ***the*** BCP 47 documents and several RFCs.

Pretty simple, huh? But as usual it’s not enough for humans. A language tag may contain more than two subtags. One possible type of a subtag is called an “extension subtag” which attaches additional information to a language tag. This additional information doesn’t have to identify a language itself. For example, it can encode locale information such as calendar and timezone. There are ***many more*** locale attributes which are defined in ***the*** Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR). Actually there is a dedicated type of extension ***subtag*** for carrying locale data which is called “Extension U”. Here are a couple of examples:

* `th-TH-u-ca-buddhist` means Thai (th) in Thailand (TH) with ***the*** Buddhist calendar (buddhist)

* `th-TH-u-ca-buddhist-nu-thai` means Thai (th) in Thailand (TH) with ***the*** Buddhist calendar (buddhist) and  the Thai numbering system (nu-thai)

***What*** about Java? Let’s just refer to what the JEP owners say:

>Support for BCP 47 language tags was was initially added in Java SE 7, with support for the Unicode locale extension limited to calendars and numbers. This JEP will implement more of the extensions specified in the latest LDML specification, in the relevant JDK classes.

More precisely, the following extensions are going to be supported by Java 10:

* cu (currency type)

* fw (first day of week)

* rg (region override)

* tz (time zone)

Be aware that the JEP is updating several methods in ***the*** `java.text`, `java.time` and `java.util` packages. You can find some details in JEP 314, although ***not many***.

Heap Allocation on Alternative Memory Devices

It turns out that there are alternative memory devices ***whose*** architecture is different from DRAM. For example, ***there is*** NV-DIMM which ***can survive*** from an unexpected power loss, and  retain the data even when electrical power is removed. And if such memory exists then someone should allocate the Java object heap on it, right? Starting from Java 10, ***the*** Hotspot JVM is going to do that. Here is what the JEP owners say:

>With the availability of cheap NV-DIMM memory, future systems may be equipped with heterogeneous memory architectures. One example of such technology is Intel’s 3D XPoint. Such an architecture, in addition to DRAM, will have one or more types of non-DRAM memory with different characteristics.

>This JEP targets alternative memory devices that have the same semantics as DRAM, including the semantics of atomic operations, and can therefore be used instead of DRAM for the object heap without any change to existing application code. All other memory structures such as the code heap, metaspace, thread stacks, etc., will continue to reside in DRAM.

The JEP says some operating systems already expose non-DRAM memory through the file system, for ***example*** NTFS DAX mode and ext4 DAX. The JEP is going to provide a way to allocate the heap in such memory. In other words, it’s going to be possible to allocate the heap on a hard drive. It will be probably slower, but on the other hand it provides other features such as ***heap persistence***. The JEP is going to introduce a new option `-XX:AllocateHeapAt=<path>` which takes a path to the file system and uses memory mapping to allocate the object heap.

The JEP owners also say the existing heap related flags such as `-Xmx`, `-Xms`, etc, and garbage-collection related flags would continue to work as before. Phew!

hotel77,"I think maybe the topic is not descriptive enough, so you're getting mixed answers. 

The typical assumption when you say API gateway, is going to be more of a thin wrapper which probably handles authn and authz, but otherwise just passes your api call along to the desired service. It would typically be a 1:1 incoming -> backend type structure. I don't think this is an anti-pattern, and I don't think that's your question.

What you're asking about, is what I typically call an orchestration gateway.  This is something that is *not* a thin wrapper like the gateway above, but something which provides it's own set of contracts that are wrapping multiple backend api calls.  This would typically be a fan-out type situation; e.g., the orchestration gateway would expose a ""get customer"" contract, and it would take a single request, and make multiple backend requests to various services (account service, address service, appointment service) to satisfy the single request of ""get customer.""

I don't think this is an anti-pattern.  I can see situations where it adds unnecessary complexity, but I can also see situations where it is extremely useful.  

The orchestration gateway can insulate clients from new technology adoption on the backend.  This allows dev teams to use cool new things (gRPC, thrift, whatever comes next) that the gateway can adapt to, while leaving the gateway's clients none the wiser.  This can have a positive affect on morale, technical debt and growth as an organization. Teams are empowered to find new interesting ways to solve problems without being bogged down with legacy contracts - if they can adjust the orchestration layer, they can insulate clients.

Another benefit I see is the concurrency you can gain by orchestrating for your clients.  First off, writing parallel/concurrent code can be trickier in certain languages than others.  There is also more that can go wrong, error handling, order of operations to consider, etc.

So, lets take our example above - to get the view of a customer we need responses from 3 individual services.  Lets say our services are pretty slow - account service responds in 250 ms, address service responds in 100ms, and appointment service responds in 300ms.  If we were to get all 3 serially, that would be 650ms, close to 3/4 of a second.  But, if we call all 3 concurrently, we can cut our response time in half (to the longest single call) to 300ms.

Without an orchestration gateway, every client (web, ios, android, desktop, whatever) needs to write the code to call all 3 endpoints concurrently, or absorb the serial cost at 650 ms.  The concurrent code in the various client languages probably has a significantly different look and feel, even if they're dealing with similar considerations.

With an orchestration gateway, that concurrent logic and wrapping is in one location - clients no longer have to concern themselves with it.  You have 1 team maintaining the orchestration gateway, and maybe that team has written the gateway in a language that excels at doing non-blocking concurrent requests (go and node come to mind, but not limited to those) 

I think orchestration gateways are powerful, and valuable...if the need for the orchestration exists.  I wouldn't, personally, start with one.  It has all of the trade-offs that you described around dual maintenance and point of failure - but those don't necessarily make it not worthwhile.  

I think an orchestration gateway is an evolutionary thing; it's the type of thing you *might* need *after* you're successful.  I doubt many people have ever said, ""if we would have just had an orchestration gateway, our product would have been successful.""

doctorsound,"1.) Correct that changes to the gateway service could have lots of downstream effects. In an ideal world, the gateway abstracts as much as possible, so there is little contract change, and also is relatively stable.

2.) A single gateway would be a single point of failure, but multiples are much more resilient. These services should be stateless so that users can be routed to any replicated gateway.

3.) Yes

jacobbeasley,"*One approach that works really nicely is to make the API gateway a configurable and re-usable service* so that multiple services can independently deploy their own API gateway, but you don't have to maintain tons of boilerplate code or separate codebases for each api gateway. You do this by making it a sort of reverse-proxy that makes sure the API Token is valid and then parses it and attaches some headers to the request. 

It works like a reverse-proxy and can be deployed as a sidecar-like app alongside your microservice. Then, all external traffic to a service (if exposed externally) would have to be authenticated and validated prior to calling the microservice. Ideally, you'd have a configuration file that declares exactly which subsets of paths you choose to expose. 

Anyways, there are a lot of ways to solve this problem (and I've seen just about all of them). Keep in mind that you don't want to have a single monolithic API gateway because, as you said, it defeats the purpose of microservices and will lead to a tightly coupled app, but you also don't want to have a shared library that requires recompiling 100+ microservices every time you tweak the way your auth tokens work.

When you are building anything else, such as a traditional http producing backend or javascript based frontend, you will probably be using JSP(or some alternative such as thymeleaf, or simple templater like handlebars.)  

In my personal experience, JSP is by far the dominant player as it is the simplest to use and understand, in addition to availability on every servlet container.

Personally, I favor writing Hibernate over JPA as it is much easier to use. I have yet to see a portability issue with it so I do not know of a compelling reason why you would insist on using JPA. 

As it stands I often favor simpler ORMs, such as mybatis, as I find JPA to be very difficult to use, especially when your DB design is out of your control and you have data spread across tables.  You inevitably have to write HQL statements to eagerly retrieve your data anyway or you take huge performance hits.  I also have not been impressed with its performance, especially in comparison to more lightweight orms.  If you are very experienced it might save you some development time but it has only caused me more problems than it has solved.

You should prefer REST over HTML, but Thymeleaf is fine, I prefer Freemarker myself.

You can have bad design with Constructor/Method injection.  It's just style guys, get over it.

2: Every time you use field injection a unit test dies

This is just so blatantly wrong it's stupid.  Every single point is a mishmosh of FUD.  ""What if I want to inject a real object"" - well, I'd suggest an Integration test where you're using spring-test and a @ContextConfiguration.  If you're wanting to construct your own ""mock"" - fine, create a setter: (`@VisibleForTesting protected void setMyThing(MyThing thing){ ... }`.  This isn't rocket science guys.

3: Classes using field injection are non-final, but are prone to circular dependencies

This is probably the closest point I can get behind, but sometimes this happens: code reuse, smaller reusable classes get passed around.  It's not a bad thing to re-use logic.  The fact that my login service needs the user service and the user service has a few methods that validate against the loginservice (`isLoggedIn`) isn't wrong.  Could it be rewritten?  Sure.  Is it the end of the world?  Anything but...  

Any time I'm doing DI and not using Spring directly (even if Spring is doing it work somewhere), I 100% always use Constructor injection for this very reason though.

Also, as an FYI, spring is never immune to circular dependencies.  Setter, Constructor or Field injection.  Your statement:

> Classes using setter injection are immune to circular dependencies

is wrong.  It makes it less likely to get them (just like field injection).

EDIT: I just checked and sure enough using constructor injection behaves as you suggest and I was wrong when it comes to circular dependencies.",1518627317.0

DannyB2,"I had to do multi-tenant and Hibernate back in 2009.  Still using | maintaining it today.  I didn't use any capability within Hibernate.

There is a ""global"" database and a per-customer database.  The global database has account login information, associated with customer information.  Each customer record has hibernate connection properties as a CLOB field.

In memory within the application is a hash table keyed by customer, of the Session Factory for each customer's database.  It starts out empty.  When the application is shut down, a loop iterates through these, removes each one and closes it.  (The destroy() method of a master servlet.)

A function is used to get the Session Factory.  It identifies the currently logged in user.  It looks in the hash for the customer ID to obtain the Session Factory for that customer.  If none, then one is created and stored.  (This must be the first time this customer DB has been accessed.)

Once that function returns the Session Factory, you're good to create a session / transaction for the currently logged in user account.

Since each customer's DB record has a CLOB of connection properties, it is possible to configure on a per-customer basis which database server their database is stored on.  Thus you can segregate certain customers to certain database serves.  For scaling.  Or to move certain heavy customers to beefier database servers.

In principle, since each customer's database connection is a set of properties in a CLOB field of the customer record, some customers could use a different *type* of database, such as Postgres vs MS-SQL.  (But I don't do this.)  Also which hibernate dialect to use, what JDBC driver to use, what connection pool class to use, are all part of the values in that CLOB field.  So each customer's database properties are highly configurable by a ServerAdmin web page control panel.  Maybe some customers need a bigger connection pool for example.  If I wanted to try using a different connection pool provider, for example, I could configure the server with both JARs, and on a fictional customer configure its database properties to use this other connection pool class.

There is no XML configuration for Hibernate at all.  The Session Factory is created entirely through Hibernate's API as described above.  Similarly, all entity beans are Annotated and a single class notifies Hibernate of the annotated beans, --again to avoid having an XML config file for Hibernate.

The approach is extremely flexible.  I did have to build some machinery myself, including configuration UI pages for server admin.  But these pages include the ability to deactivate individual login accounts, deactivate entire customers, activate or control which app features certain customers can use, etc.  I didn't need any special capability from Hibernate other than its ability to construct the Session Factory through the API, and keep it stored in a global hash table behind my own mechanism that gets a session factory during an HTTPS transaction.

I could implement a mechanism to close session factories that have not been used for some time.  But in all these years, it has not been necessary to build that.

This is probably too blanket a statement.  Spring is a very powerful tool for Dependency Injection.  For simple apps, this is probably overkill, but there are complex CLI apps.

I'd also point out that simple apps have a tendency to become complex over time.

> @Autowiring works best for Datasources, DAOs, and/or classes that depend on (Autowire) DAOs themselves.

Hmm, not sure what you mean here.  @Autowire fields?  Autowiring as concept (aka injection by type) works great for all kinds of situations, especially for design patterns, e.g. Strategy.

Even if you have a single impl of a type, DI still makes sense as you have centralized lifecycle management of your beans, and have the opportunity to apply interceptors, etc...

> @Qualifiers make sense if you're autowiring a something like a Datasource, ie. a class included with Java and not something that you write and make a @Component. Using a @Qualifier to autowire a mock class into a unit test also kind of makes sense to me. Outside of those 2 scenarios, it's use seems a little gamy and I think the odds of you needing it are kind of low.

Qualifiers are a way of providing a ""hint"" to the DI engine, for scenarios when type alone isn't enough.  It's not frequently used in my experience, but it sure comes in handy once in a while.

> Field based Autowiring is a terrible practice and should never be used outside of unit tests for the sake of code brevity.

I'd say field based autowiring shouldn't generally be used.  I prefer constructor-based injection (declare your collaborators final and use Lombok's [@RequiredArgsConstructor](https://projectlombok.org/features/constructor) for awesomesauce!).  Unit tests should use same ""injection entry points"" as real code, imo.

> Profiles are great and should always be used, but PropertySource is a little more circumstantial. The app we're writing, we want the configurations to be editable by the user. So we're storing the configurations in a DB and making a GUI for them since they're not that technical.

Profiles are great.  Always may be a bit too simplistic, but I've not come across a real application where they weren't helpful.  Some folk used to use maven build profiles (i.e. env-specific builds, blech!) and this solves that problem rather nicely.

> XML configuration is completely dead and should never be used.

I'd say more to avoid in general, the DSL being built up around the java configs is nice, especially with builders, insights, javadocs, etc...  That being said there are some cases where the custom xml schemas around some of the extensions are still superior.

> Spring AOP is terrible. Go with annotation based AspectJ. Yes you need a maven plug in but who cares, it's easy. Also consider using the "".aj"" language if you really know what you're doing.

I think this documentation is pretty solid at explaining the differences:  https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop-spring-or-aspectj  

As to using Aspect files, I've not used it in some time (~4 years) but it would bog down IDE (Eclipse) last I checked.  I also find that it becomes an alternate style to composing i.e. instead of modeling separate classes to contain concerns, they get put into separate aspects.  This isn't necessarily bad, but again, with my experience of heavy slowness in the IDE, I avoid.

Additionally, Aspects, like any other tool can be over used.  You can put your core business logic into aspects, but should you?

> I keep reading online that getBean should never be used. And I think I agree. It just seems wrong. I think the scenario that fools people is when they have a classic GoF factory class that instantiates a type that depends on a DAO. Since you can't autowire the type returned by your factory, they think you can't autowire your DAO and so you need to use getBean (in order to get the juicy benefits of profiles and propertysources). However you CAN just autowire the DAOs into your factory, and then hand them off to the objects your instantiating inside your factory. Don't know what factory you need? Autowire your factories into an Abstract factory and then autowire that abstract factory into whatever class needs it. Sorry if this one is confusing.

_dban_,"> @Autowiring works best for Datasources, DAOs, and/or classes 
> that depend on (Autowire) DAOs themselves.

Autowiring is the heart of Spring. Spring, at its core, is a Dependency Injection container. `@Autowire` is how you inject dependencies. It is used extensively in Spring applications the way `@Inject` is used in CDI or Guice applications.

In fact, `@Autowire` transcends Spring or even Java. Angular has autowiring too.

> @Qualifiers make sense if you're autowiring a something like a 
> Datasource

Spring autowiring is type based. Meaning if you have multiple `DataSource` classes in your application context and try to autowire a `DataSource`, Spring won't know which one you want. That's why `@Qualifier` exists, to let you tell Spring which specific bean you want. 

> XML configuration is completely dead and should never be used.

Not necessarily. I frequently use XML configuration for externalizing SQL queries using the util namespace to create maps, and then inject the maps into the application (tip: use `@Resource` instead of `@Autowire` when injecting instances of Java collections). Java doesn't have multiline strings, but in XML, I can wrap the SQL in a CDATA and not have to mutilate SQL.

Also, certain Spring projects I feel make better sense to configure in XML. In particular, Spring Integration. Since Spring Integration is defining a workflow, I find it easier to visualize the workflow in XML.

XML configuration sucks for the vast majority of use cases and you should use Java config wherever possible, but don't necessarily write off XML config. It still has its uses.

> Spring AOP is terrible. 

This is one of the reasons I prefer Guice to Spring DI. AspectJ is good and all, but many Spring products already have already configured AOP for you (such as `@Transactional`). Use what Spring provides first before introducing AspectJ.

Also, never *ever* say it's just a Maven build plugin.  


With AspectJ, you are complicating your build process, since you need to activate compile time weaving to rewrite bytecode after the Java compiler has done its work. Thus, the final bytecode doesn't match the source code, which can result in massive confusion.

Or, you can install a Java agent to hack the class loader to rewrite classes at runtime. AspectJ, along with any other tools which manipulate bytecode, introduce dark arts into your Java code. Be careful when playing with black magic. Let others do it if you can (like CGLIB).

> I keep reading online that getBean should never be used.

Because it defeats Dependency Injection, and like the Wizard if Oz, lets you see the man behind the curtain. Dependency Injection mean, ""Don't call us, we'll call you"". DI decouples dependency management from business logic, making things like the Singleton Pattern obsolete. But, injecting the injector defeats that.

But, sometimes you do need to inject the injector, especially when you're doing very dynamic things or integrating with third party code that doesn't understand Spring autowiring. But this code should be isolated and hidden away in specific integration classes.

The `getBean` method has its uses, but should be used in very special circumstances, not ordinary code.",1518442676.0

2. I think Autowiring, and Component Scanning, are horrible. I understand that Autowiring is necessary for some concerns, but I avoid it as much as possible. And I always avoid Component Scanning if I can.

RupertMaddenAbbott,"1. We use Spring for command line apps and it works great. What problems are you having? The one issue I am aware of is that it can add to your startup time but I would only worry about that if it was a significant portion of the running time. Most of the command line apps I've written have some other bottleneck, e.g. network, so the startup time seems negligible. I wouldn't write a grep replacement using Spring (but then JVM startup is already too slow so I wouldn't use Java).
2. Autowiring works great for classes that are stateless other than their dependencies i.e. classes that only have final fields. I think the complexity is usually too great for the benefits if you try and start autowiring prototypes. I find it much easier to have stateless services and pass around state via manually created objects.
3. I agree with your usage of @Qualifier. I also like to wrap my qualified dependencies if I find that I am injecting them more than once, and then inject the wrapper based on type.
4. Yup! 100% agree with a couple of rare exceptions (e.g. autowiring into an abstract base class)
5. I would prefer trying to simplify the configuration over writing a GUI to make it user editable but if that is not possible then I agree PropertySource won't help you.
6. Yup! XML pushes a lot more errors to runtime and makes it harder to work out what is going on. Java configuration solves all of these issues.
7. I don't have enough experience with AOP to comment. Spring has great transaction/security support and I haven't had to touch either Spring AOP (although it is presumably using that under the hood?) nor AspectJ directly.

One thing I ran into was how Ebean does locking for updates. It uses optimistic locking by default, so be careful to make sure that data writes/updates in sql migrations are in the exact same format that entities use. i.e Dates, decimal places, etc.

Ebean was the default ORM for the Java version.
I liked it quite a lot, it wasn't bloated like Hibernate and you had active record crud style out of the box ( something like Spring JPA data ...findOne(id), findAll() etc.... ).

But ... it's a single guy maintaining that lib, it's difficult for a single person to maintain and support that and I guess that's also the reason why the Play framework dropped it as the default implementation.

* Standard stuff generally works but once you have complex queries things can get ugly. I remember an ocassion where a Iterator over a query result would simply not work. (each iteration contained the first element of the list instead of the actual element of the iterator position) So I ended up having to do rawsql and my own resultiterstor for more complex queries.

* Testing can be frustrating. Ebean entities need to be enhanced, the framework I used did this for me, however when running tests suddenly I had to do it myself which caused some headaches and nondeterministic tests.

* Lots of versions. I think it already is at version 10 or something, when I was writing my first App with Ebean 2 years ago it was only version 3

Your choices are to create a new planning poker ""game"" or join existing.  If you create one, it creates an instance ID, if you join one, you use the instance ID given to you (the instance ID is generated by @Id / JPA value) etc.  You'd then expose it RESTfully, /instance/{instanceId} with verbs to join, create, delete etc.

I just recently had a similar type experience when trying to pile onto the RequestScope, in my use case I use trying to store a user's personal API secret / username into a RequestScoped variable.  In this case, each user has unique API keys for this particular website's service (not controlled by me).  It'd be great if that was simply injected into each service.  I was able to get it working in all cases save for an important one, using Quartz Jobs, where I interface with that service on behalf of the user.  I ended up scrapping the whole thing and simply passing in the APICredentials object.

I'm trying to help you out, I'm not 100% sure my answer is in line with what you're looking for, but the tl;dr is that I believe you are using Session incorrectly, as it's designed on a per-user basis, not to be shared.

I'd also encourage that you do role some type of authentication, as it's not that safe to be able to arbitrarily access other people's planning ""games"".  It could be as simple as the instanceId plus some significant password that the creator decides.

I really find this hard to believe. Did you seriously find nothing when typing ""benefits of spring"" in to Google?

To give you the benefit of the doubt, here are a few advantages:

1. It's easy to use - you can get an application up and running within a minute, especially with projects like Spring Boot.

2. It's modular - there are a slew of modules that can be included to do everything from security to databases to transaction management to service discovery, etc.

3. It's well supported - development is very active, feedback is taken into account, and they learn from past mistakes (e.g. XML).

But once you understand these concepts, then SpringBoot is great: you have a lot functionalities which you can easily activate with just a couple of annotations. 
For example, I still fondly remember when I tried for the first time to use Spring Cloud to have a gateway with session-based authentication stored on a Redis instance... I was expecting days of hard fighting and debugging nightmares... but by just reading the Spring docs/tutorials I had it up and running in few minutes.

You can save a lot of time with Spring. Just look at the conversion service, for example. It can be used anywhere in the framework and can easily be extended with your own converters, and Spring figures out when to use what converter.

RupertMaddenAbbott,"The only concrete issue you have mentioned is that you feel Spring obfuscates what is going on. I remember feeling this same way when writing Spring with XML:

* I can make errors that should be caught by the compiler e.g. spell a class name incorrectly.
* I have no motivation to prefer wiring things up in a way that could be caught by the compiler e.g. inject by name instead of by type.
* I have no way to tell what is going on behind custom namespaces.

However, all of that went away with that Java API. Now I find it very trivial to see exactly what is going on.

In my opinion, Spring (with Spring Boot) manage to solve three issues simultaneously. I have not encountered another approach/framework that has managed that:

* If I use no framework or a micro framework, I will end up writing a lot of code to solve problems that others have already solved.
* If I use a bunch of independent libraries or decoupled frameworks, I will spend most of my time debugging the glue code that makes them all work together.
* If I use a full stack framework, I will spend most of my time trying to understand why it does things in a way that I am not expecting.

The decoupled nature of Spring, with the convention-over-configuration approach of Spring Boot, has created something quite unique and powerful. Spring Boot has essentially externalised the task of glueing all these libraries together out to the open source community. Now with every piece of functionality, I have the option of either importing the starter to get everything working quickly, or using the underlying library directly, when I need it to work in a more specialised way. I can also move from the fully configured to fully unconfigured in a gradual fashion.

Overall, that means I find I spend very little time on the framework, and lots of time on developing the unique pieces that actually add value.",1518094548.0

* Middleware / filters - Why would we want those hardcoded in a sane place where the order is obvious. Let's scan our entire classpath and order them based on some `@Prioirty` annotation. That way we can accidentally pull in more filters without even knowing by adding more dependencies.

mvysny,"I started to avoid Spring when its magic hit me in my face with 100+ stack exception pointing towards runtime-generated code and Spring internals, with no way of knowing what's going on. That's maintainability hell. I started to avoid JavaEE when I tried to have a session-scoped LoginManager which could read users from a database - that's stateful bean and it just generated tons of NoBeanInScopeExceptions. I started to hate Dependency Injection when I had to turn every UI component (a PersonTable fetching list of Persons) into a managed bean in order to be able to access a bloody database. Java is not bad per-se; the problem is that it attracts crowd of complexity people giving birth to mammoths like Spring and JavaEE.

Example: often all your project needs is to access a database. In Spring you need to include tons of libraries, create @Transactional-annotated services which will be enhanced in runtime, and inject them into your web layer somehow, only to have a database transaction. In reality all you need is to have a stupid function which will start the transaction, run given block and then commit the transaction afterwards: db { em.persist(Person()) } . That's database transaction in Kotlin. In Java 7 it was so annoying since you had to write new Runnable(){} etc etc, in Java 8 it's better but still sucks: db((em)->{ em.persist(new Person()) }).

I saw the immense simplicity, yet at first I was afraid to make the move. Everybody is using Spring so it has to have a value, right? There must be some wisdom in DI and bean caching and all that, because so many corporate apps are using Spring. But then I looked at that 100+ stack exception and it made me so angry I made the move. Nowadays, from time to time I tend to be angry at myself - how stupid I was before, to blindly follow all Spring jarheads to let them dictate what I should use.

You don't have to use Spring Boot - nowadays even retarded Eclipse is able to launch your WAR app just fine by a single click of a button. Or just use Intellij Ultimate. Use proper tools; don't let flawed tools require you to put workarounds into your code. Yes, I perceive Spring Boot as a workaround for Eclipse not being able to launch a WAR app.

You don't have to use DI just to have a database transaction - just call your db{} method from anyplace you see fit.

You don't have to use Spring because it does X - there is a library for that which you can use right away! For example: do you need REST client? Use Retrofit directly. Do you need JPA? Use Hibernate directly and pass EntityManager instance into the block of your db{} method.

Drop Spring and embrace the freedom of you being in charge of the way how you structure your code, how you instantiate classes and how you call them.

Now, after 3+ years without any DI nor Spring nor JavaEE, I believe your gut feeling is absolutely correct. I believe Spring mutilates the way of thinking of its practitioners. Spring is the way into complexity, its practitioners think in terms of complexity and if you seek simplicity it's next to impossible to find common grounds. Don't waste your energy arguing, follow the simplicity path. Oh great this sounds like a cult or something :-D

I nowadays believe that you can replace Spring simply by the features of the Kotlin programming language.

These days, I would scratch the same sort of pure design instinct I had back then with something like Haskell, Kotlin, C# on .NET Core, or maybe Scala if I'm feeling complicated.

2. I wont get locked out of my Email account. Because if i do i am screwed because i cant login to any service using it to change it to use a new email adress. Fun times talking to the support of the service.

As for 'java-coroutines', it appears to be a front-end for 'java-coroutines-core' which uses compile-time bytecode instrumentation (just like Kotlin basically).

To be honest, I am not really impressed with the code quality. The code is very obscure. Why is there an InnerCoroutine and a Coroutine, where InnerCoroutine extends a different class also called Coroutine? Why do these two have references to eachother? There are a lot more basic code style issues, a lot also with the names of things (not a fan of `Cohelper`, but also things like `runAfter1` to avoid using `this.runAfter`).

Also, why does java-coroutines-core break on uninstrumented external libraries? In Kotlins case, code that wasn't compiled with suspension in mind cannot be paused, but also doesn't make pause calls so it's not a problem.",1517526994.0

farrellf,"Many others have pointed out how to do it with installers. But here's what I do when I want a simple .EXE that the user can double-click on and the program just runs. No installer, no folders of files, nothing for the user to screw up.

Use Launch4J to make an .EXE from your fat Jar. Configure it to use a bundled JRE. Then make a self-expanding archive that contains your EXE and JRE. Configure it to automatically extract to a temporary folder and to run your EXE.

It works great. The only drawback is the archive has to decompress every time you run the program. I find that to be a decent trade-off if I need to give the program to a user and make it as idiot-proof as possible.

- Java 7 is a big no no at this point in time (either huge legacy blockers or no care about dev QoL). Java moves slowly enough that companies, even fairly big ones, can be expected to keep up with it.

- Spring 3 and lower is also bad. No need to have the Spring Boot shiny bandwagon, but just try to at least offer Spring 4 now that 5 is out already and that most of the transition from one to the other are painless

- If you're looking for full-stack profiles, do not have your frontend built on JSF/Struts/GWT... And if you're on AngularJS, know that you're still at a disadvantage because of that since even the most egregiously outdated stacks often offer better frontend techs for greenfield-ish projects nowadays.

- Talk about your CI quality. If you use Jenkins/Docker/<insert shiny ops tech> internally, mention it. It shows a great deal or attention is put on the code quality and that there is at least a belief that code shouldn't be put to rot. This means ""you won't have to deal with horrific/untested code. at least not all the time"".

And because we are not in an ideal world, if one of these applies, see if there are plans to migrate out of them. If not, see if you can handle doing it in the future and if yes, add it to the posting.
Updating dependencies is often a sign that there is ""amending"" on past mistakes. And that the prospect will not be in an environment that is hostile to change.

Also if you ever release source code in the open-source world, mention that. Even if it's some collections libraries, some git workflow tool, whatever. This counts.

RockMeetHardPlaces,"1) False.  This just isn't true.  You can argue that constructor injection is a ""better"" way to do it over field or method injection, but it has NOTHING to do with Unit tests and mocking.  @Mock / @InjectMocks - done.  There's many other tools that have been around just as long to do this.  If you don't want to use Mockito (JMock, etc) then fine - use Constructor/Method injection.  There's nothing wrong with it, but field injection is not an impediment to Unit tests.

2) Not sure where you're going with this one.  If it's part of the method, it's part of the method.  You want to test your actual software, right?  SHOULD you be making a new rest template in that fashion?  Probably not, but again, nothing related to testing.

3) Yes, and No.  No - it doesn't make testing more difficult.  It's just a different type of test.  That'd be what I'd call an ""integration"" test.  My rule of thumb with spring = if you create a spring context to test it, you're integration testing.  If you're creating mocks, you're unit testing.

I've worked several places that decided unit testing would be ""fun"". It always follows the same path:  
1\. Lots of excitement  
2\. A combination of stress and excitement  
3\. A few months go by and the newness and attention to them wears off  
4\. Everyone ""in the loop"" either starts writing short pointless unit tests to check them off the list, or they stop writing them altogether  
5\. New features or bug fixes that break unit tests just get the offending test commented out - no one can afford to spend 3 days tracking down how a unit tests works for a feature that took 1 day to implement  
6\. Usually there's one person who insists on continuing to write lengthy unit tests, and that person either gets fired or gets in trouble with management for ""taking to long"" as they don't realize no one else is doing it any more  

End-to-end tests are the only tests I've seen that have a chance at being updated along with code changes, and it's hard for those to but at least they have a chance.  

You just end up with this big ball of unmaintained unit tests - I've never seen it go any other way.",1517798523.0

It's not necessarily bad practice. It offers certain tradeoffs. Perhaps having portions of the codebase written in Java or Scala allows developers to take advantage of certain language features or parts of the ecosystem that makes some problems easier to solve. On the flip side, it also adds a considerable amount of complexity to the project.

Rewrites are astonishingly expensive. Rewrites are one of the things that [killed Netscape](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/).

ExtropianPirate,"> Should I consider rewriting it

This all depends on how the team is dealing with the codebase. If your other team members are on board with refactoring from one language to another, and there has been continuous progress toward that end, you should follow their lead. Don't go refactoring the whole thing in one go, though.

> Just wondering is this a normal thing or is it bad practice?

Having more than one language is not a problem _per se_, but I think a switch from Java to Scala (I assume this is what is happening here) is a difficult thing to get right.

If you need your Scala code to be usable from your Java code, you're very limited in the functionality you can use in the classes that must expose functionality to Java. Scala has a lot of functionality that Java can't understand, so you would either have to isolate such functionality behind a Java-compatible facade, or not use it at all. There are other problems too, like library incompatibilities; Scala's collections aren't directly compatible with Java's collections, so conversions have to happen at the boundaries. These two things aren't big problems if the team is dedicated to making the switch and is making continuous progress to that end, as they should only be temporary, during the transition.

**tl;dr**: Moving from one language to another isn't a problem, as long as the team is dedicated to doing so, and is making continuous progress. You should always work with the team.",1517444206.0

m-apo,"Benchmarking and (micro)-optimizing code with the JVM is pretty difficult. JIT, GC and other optimizations make the JVM behave in non-deterministic ways which can at worst send you on a goose chase. And the behaviour can change depending on JVM versions and load characteristics.

I participated in a coding competition where you were supposed to write efficient bin packing algo. I learned a few things:

* For raw looping over arrays and sets JVM9 takes 60% longer than JVM8 (4 vs 2.5 seconds)
* -XX:-BackgroundCompilation is pretty good for fast JVM startup with both JVM8 and JVM9
* JVM's and standard library classes' optimizations  and micro-optimizations make it pretty hard to predict how your own micro-optimizations affect the performance (when you're trying to shave off milliseconds).

_dban_,"> Gasp, isn’t REST supposed to be “stateless”, though?

REST isn't supposed to be stateless, that would be as silly as saying functional programming is stateless. Any system that doesn't have state can't possibly do anything useful. Like functional programming, REST just has a different approach for dealing with state.

REST is built on stateless protocols like HTTP. In which case, the client has to keep state (like JSESSIONID) and send it to the server through the cookie header so that the server can understand the request. This is a low effort way to do security, because you're piggybacking on a mechanism already provided by the servlet container.

""Stateless"" authentication simply separates concerns. You use special cookies or HTTP headers to store a purpose-built authentication token. Instead of using the JSESSIONID to locate user authentication, you use the token. Since the token isn't tied to the servlet container, you avoid problems like the need for session affinity. Of course, you would have to set up your own cache instead of using the cache you get for free in the HttpSession.

JWT takes stateless authentication to the next level by storing the authentication details in the token itself, avoiding the need for lookup on the server side. This improves performance at the cost of significantly increased complexity.",1517230740.0

This is just insincere if you don't mention what the problem is. Some libraries used to allow for clients to use the ""none"" algorithm (which is in the spec for testing purposes). Most good libraries don't enable this without the developer explicitly choosing to do so. So it's a mistake of library developers not doing the right thing **and** developers implementing security without fully understanding what they were doing.

Benemon,"Just rereading this - nice jumping off points into a deeper dive.

In my experience, the organisations I’ve worked with who have the lofty goal of microservices adoption often fail on three counts, which more often that not have nothing to do with the actual code (regardless of whether it’s greenfield or brownfield):

* Automation

* Monitoring

* Fault Tolerance of services

Basically, building microservices is hard. 

If you don’t automate everything, then you quickly end up with an unmanageable spaghetti of stuff that’s as just as inflexible (or even more so) than the thing you were trying to replace. Manual build and deployment are fine for the first service. Or the first five. But in true MSA you’re going to find that service sprawl can occur quickly, and if you don’t automate the build and deployment of your components  from day one, it quickly becomes a massive operational overhead. 

In addition, if you don’t have good, centralised logging / metrics / tracing then you a SOL when one of your components either fails or goes into a degraded state. How can you hope to even start with issue resolution and root cause analysis if you can’t correlate the events which lead to the failure state? You can’t - we’ll, no easily, and certainly not quickly. You’re stuffed. 

Which leads onto the third thing - fault tolerance. If you don’t implement patterns like Bulkheads, Circuit Breakers, Retry, then you can end up with cascading failure scenarios. Good luck with that. You’ve now got a distributed monolith that’s slower than the thing you migrated from (because networks are horrible and should never be trusted). Teaching people the importance of bounded contexts and asynchronous, event driven architectures is always going to be key to the success of any microservices project. 

Building microservices is *hard*.

tjxn,"To some degree, this is true.  The JVM was designed to support an object oriented execution model.  Classes and objects are a fundamental part of how the JVM works.  JVM bytecode isn't just some abstract machine code; classes and objects are fundamental parts of the architecture.  At the most basic level, JVM programs are delivered in class files.  Anything executable must exist within the class structure as part of a method and any variables that live longer than a method execution must exist as members of a class.  There are JVM bytecode operations for method dispatch, object creation, etc.

Now, technically, a language that compiles to JVM bytecode could ignore all of the ""object"" stuff, treat classes as namespaces and use only static methods and variables, effectively becoming a procedural system within the object-oriented JVM.  This will work as long as the language provides an entire ecosystem to work with.  However, once you begin to interact with any part of the existing JVM ecosystem (e.g. java standard libraries, external libraries, etc.) you are effectively forced to participate in the object model upon which all those libraries are based.

So, while it is not strictly correct that running on the JVM requires you to participate in the Java object model from a high-level language perspective, it *is* true from a practical standpoint.  (Unless the language designers or community around that language want to reimplement the java standard library and the rest of the community created ecosystem.)   ",1517075669.0

kakakarl,"Some say JSF does the controller part and your scoped bean is actually part of the model. For a reference @Model is the name of the annotation that provides @RequestScoped and @Named. 

Most view the beans as controllers. Either way they should be lightweight. 

I think you should forget about this for now anyways. Design patterns are not useful until they are and for now just read Clean Code and use those patterns...

Make sure everyone is wriing business logic in smaller tested classes. Only a very small fraction of the app should touch frameworks. Let java be the center. Then make thin layers that use best practices for your apis or controllers.

Every bean that you attach with EL should be requestscoped. All state is kept in a Stateholder. The stateholder for say personBean manages only persons. The stateholder only keeps required filters and stuff you need for future requests. The bean holds the response thats needed to draw the view. Inject the stateholder in the personbean using constructror injection and in your @Postconstruct you assign the state objects from the various stateholders (often just one) in rare cases you need some other state. The state object is business logic and is just plain java. So the controller looks at the state and creates a thing from that and the posted info. The thing can then be accessed with a getter. The thing dies after the request is finished and the view is drawn.

When the user clicks row x you send the index to the controller, build the whole thing again and use that index or primarykey. 

This keeps the heap clean and uses more CPU and thats great for the ui part of your software. Make sure heavy stuff is proccessed in another container.

Architects today need containers, microservices, something that clues it together and a lot of Clean Code. Read Clean Coder and Clean Architecture as well. The Jsf stuff is just a small scratch on the surface. Jsf is not a good choice anymore because the test environment is bad. Look at a framework like angular that generates boilerplate tests for you that work well from the get go.

Tests are your mission. They will teach you how to stay away from coupling and make you focus on business logic",1517047114.0
thatsIch,"> do I try and keep a minimal controller and build service layers that are delegates for the controller?

yes, the difficult thing with JSF is, that it is also part of your deployment (if you choose so) and also Java. The Decoupling needs to be maintained on your side. For some applications, it is advised to choose a more client base system like web components which is naturally better decoupled from business knowledge as given through a different language.",1517046783.0
kjaer_unltd,"I would like to recommend the domain driven design book, by Chris Evans. It is very tough to get through but it gives a clear definition of controllers, services, domain object, repository and how they all fit together. When you understand it, every other pattern becomes so much clearer in what they are supposed to achieve. 

Looking at old code i often stuffed a lot of user stuff into a UserService, now I understand how to structure the user handling domain into a model representing the users and the login logic into a designated LoginService since that is a cross cutting concern that handles users but is separate for them. Changing the users password is part of the users domain, since that is something that acts on the user. 

Its all small stuff, but the structure of your application just begins to make so much more sense. 

In your case you have a viewmodel represented by a scoped bean. But the actual business logic is better handled in another layer in your application so you can test it and reuse it. 

Seen from the templates the beans are the model and / or controllers. But more holistically all the JSF parts Can be seen as just the view and the model is separate. 

You can also inject your jpa entities into the view but then you quickly loose sight of what logic belongs Where. 

In short: separate logic a lot, but not too much. Read some books. And dont be afraid to refactor to a better design when it makes sense.

There were no widespread resources to teach them how to build software. Almost half of all developers (47%) between the ages of 45 and 54 started coding before they were 16 years old. **Meanwhile, developers between 18 and 24 today are the least likely to have started coding before 16 (only 20%).**

I think this is a worrysome trend. Because computers are so 'easy' to use but on the other hand so 'complex' to understand very few kids get exposed to the 'guts' of what is happening. The main reason I started programming somewhere in the 80ies because back then you could copy games by typing out basic listings in magazines. 

I hope we find a way to expose kids to the fun and creative 'maker' side of programming more. 

Also frankly; I think there's quite a selection bias in the results. It's very visible in the bit where ""execs"" are looking for portfolios.

Maybe something like 3 months of overlap between an LTS release and the next STS release, and a month between STS releases, to provide those who can't afford commercial support an opportunity to transition smoothly to the next release.

OTOH, they've been pretty good about providing early access builds of upcoming releases. I guess they consider that to be sufficient for those getting a free ride. Maybe it will drive more use of those early access builds, resulting in even better initial releases for everyone.

duhace,"Apparently, the aforementioned incubating features would be ones that are complete or mostly complete but could use some time and exposure to finalize or be refined. I think something that would be put forward as an incubating feature today would be jpms. 

Incubating features would be enabled by passing the compiler a special flag such as ```javac --incubating 11``` to activate the special incubating features for JDK 11. This would allow developers to test and give feedback on new features without embedding them in the language early.

Here is the justification of this in its entirety:

> To build confidence in the correctness and completeness of a new language or VM feature, it is desirable for the feature to enjoy a period of broad exposure after its specification and implementation are stable but before it achieves final and permanent status in the Java SE Platform. This period is called incubation. Including the feature in a mainline JDK feature release will give the broadest possible exposure and opportunity for swift feedback. It will also encourage tool vendors to build good support for the feature before the bulk of Java developers use it in production. Before the next JDK feature release, the feature's ""real world"" strengths and weaknesses will be evaluated to decide if the feature has a long-term role in the Java SE Platform and, if so, whether it needs refinement. Consequently, the feature may be granted final and permanent status (with or without refinements), or undergo a period of ""re-incubation"" (with or without refinements), or else be removed.",1516630329.0

olivergierke,"Disclaimer: I am the project lead of Spring Data REST. I think the article is not a really great example.

First of all, the example is poorly designed. Validation annotations don't belong into a domain model. Bi-directional relationships should be avoided. Spring Data REST is built around the notion of aggregates managed by Spring Data repositories. A tag is hardly an aggregate. An article might be but the post creates the impression, that you'd simply create repositories for all your entities, switch on Spring Data REST and be done with it. You can of course do that but you'll end up with a CRUD via HTTP that's slightly better than direct exposure of your database. I've left a quite extensive [comment](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/ddd-rest#anch142195) in the thread on a recording of my [DDD & REST talk from 2016's SpringOne](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/ddd-rest). That gives a bit more context on how we think SD REST should be used. Also [Advanced Spring Data REST](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/spring-data-rest-springone2016) has more of that in the talk recording.

To get a bit more detailed: what is leaking to the API is that you haven't thought your ""domain model"" (I actually really isn't one) through. DDD recommends to scope changes that require strong consistency to a single aggregate. You have artificially created two. I'd argue you want tags to be part of the article aggregate and then create some separate query and/or read-only resource that allows you to inspect all tags available etc. I.e. what's leaking into the API is a insufficiency in you domain model. That's not the fault of any technology but considering entities plain abstractions of tables and thinking in database ways.",1516571164.0
bfoo,"I dont like Spring Data. It doesn‘t solve the problem of leaky abstraction. I still use entity classes in upper layers. Especially the fact that Long (as an example) is used as the internal ID of the entitystore. And exposing the repository as interface via REST can cause trouble with incompatible changes.

My entities only have String as an identifier. The real type is converted by the repository implementation. And I prefer to abstract entities away using interfaces for the entities themself and for the builders that configure them. Entity references (e.g. OneToMany) are never exposed by the interfaces. I always introduce a Aggregate type for this.

For prototyping or really small applications, I probably don‘t care so much. But even a Microservice can become a large application...",1516526702.0

The part I've seen the most people struggle with is not the technical aspect at all (which will obviously take practice, for neigh everyone), but the logic. 

Next time you're struggling in the class, try to think about what is causing you problems. 

* Can you explain the problem? 
 
 * This is hugely important. Clearly identify the problem to be solved before you do anything else.

* Can you explain how you could solve the problem in English?

Sure, some fell through and repeated a year, but that was due to not taking it seriously enough. Or maybe one needs a year longer to understand the concepts.

I think it rather sounds like the teacher is bad in explaining the concepts and should rethink their ways, or even their career choice.

To understand a concept, an explanation is always based on certain premises which one should understand beforehand (e.g. Multiplication means one needs to understand addition). Maybe those premises are misunderstood? Maybe the teach just jumps ahead to quickly? Give yourself time and try and break down what the teach says yourself.

Programming has many many concepts and it can be very daunting to begin. But after a while, one will get the hang of it, if one really wants to. 

I had the same problem understanding OOP in the beginning and one day i found a different explanation somewhere and it just went home and i never had a problem again afterwards. So, try and do your own research and see if you can understand those concepts by yourself.

In my experience with JSF over the past 5 years once your UI needs become more complex than various input elements bound to a backing bean that serve as parameters to something that produces easily tabularized data, then JSF becomes a hugely inefficient tool to build such UI.  

You end up fighting with the framework to get it to do what is required, and inevitably implement ""creative solutions"" which don't necessarily fit correctly within the abstractions provided by JSF.  Maintaining this going forward becomes increasingly difficult unless your pages are trivially simple to begin with.  I've also found it quite cumbersome to build reusable widgets and components that provide common functionality throughout our app.  

Building the UI for any new feature is always the most time consuming, tedious, and error-prone process.  It can easily take 2-5 times the effort of implementing the other functionality required for the feature, depending on UI complexity.

Spring Data Rest is amazing.  Mapping your domain to endpoints automatically == well worth the setup.  You remove sooo much bullshit boilerplate CRUD controllers.

The main issues: huge learning curve.  You need to know Spring very well, spring boot moderately well, JPA very well, etc.  The JPA requirement being a pretty significant bottleneck.  You will spend time hacking around it to get your validation working.  You will find bugs, issues with collection types, annoyances with some of the updates/adding to and from your various associations.  You will find issues with it and other Spring tools (security, integration being pretty massive time sinks with data rest).  Testing will be interesting, if you approach that at all.  You will probably still end up writing a few controllers for ""oddball"" type of requests.  It is QUITE opinionated and you may disagree with some of the ways things were implemented (i know i do).

That being said, I use it in all my new projects.  Not having a million controllers and DTOs is wayyyy worth.  I have enough boilerplate configuration after a few projects that I reuse to make it usable.

OpenJDK/JVM - I don't like that it's such a memory hog (not sure which of them). Think about small apps/batches. Or do you remember azureus/vuze? Then utorrent came and it was so small/sweet.. If a small Java app used 5 times less memory, it would still be like 10 times more than a basic luajit app.. (yes times, not %cents)  And it's also hard to estimate exact memory limit.

The only thing I find really annoying about java because it would be so easy to fix is that you still have to generate getters and setters. How are we on Java 10 and yet we don't have a @property annotation? Even then it's just an annoyance, but it's such an easy annoyance to fix.  

Java's ""verboseness"" is a positive. There's a bazillion ""non-verbose languages"" out there that didn't catch on, partly because they're hard to read and parse through.

FrigoCoder,"Java is slow at adopting language features and changes. Most other issues stem from this.

### Checked exceptions

- They were a huge mistake, and Java designers *still* insist on them.
- They have literally no benefits over unchecked exceptions, only humongous drawbacks.
- They do not scale to large codebases.
- They hinder creation of new code.
- They spread like cancer in existing code and callers.
- They make code ugly, illegible, and unmaintainable.
- They give rise to dangerous bad practices of exception handling.
- They are used inconsistently even within the standard libraries.
- They are incompatible with lambda expressions and streams.
- No other programming language has them.
- We absolutely do not need them. Get rid of them already!

### Poor generics

- Java generics are simply syntactic sugar for casting.
- Type erasure is used instead of the more modern type reification in C#.
- Primitives have to be autoboxed to classes, which is very wasteful.
- Collections on primitives can not be optimized for space and/or speed.
- Generic methods have to be declared for all primitives instead of just once.
- Generic constraints have messy syntax. [Kotlin-style generics](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/generics.html) would be much simpler.
- No template specialization like in C++ which can come in handy sometimes.

### No value types, operator overloading, or proper == semantics

- Classes have space and performance overhead, they are not suited for large volume high speed numeric computations.
- Operator overloading is necessary for legibility of numeric software.
- Operator == and != are reference comparison, the value comparison is hidden behind equals calls which is less legible.
- Java lost a lot of market share for artificial intelligence, computer vision, signal processing, and other numerical applications due to these factors.

### No properties

- No language support for properly encapsulated getters, setters, and backing fields.
- Properties are simulated by overly-verbose getter and setter methods.

### Outdated standard libraries

- Let's face it, Java standard libraries are a mess. Especially file and network operations.
- Lot of missing features. I want a Math.Sqr god damn it!
- As I have mentioned, new lambda expression based libraries are incompatible with checked expressions.

### Stream syntax

- Verbose, needs calls to stream() or parallelStream(), and toArray(), collect(toList()), etc.
- Javascript has the nicest stream syntax.
- C# has a similarly verbose stream syntax in the form of LINQ.
- Again, streams and lambdas are incompatible with checked expressions.
- What is this feature called anyway? Streams? Integrated queries? Map/reduce?

### No native Software Transactional Memory

- STM beats the shit out of locks. Gimme native support!

### No null safety

- Types are nullable by default, this forces programmers to deal with possible null values.
- Non-nullable types should be the default, nullable types should have syntax like String? or something.
- @NonNull declarations are too verbose and make the code illegible.

### No reassignment safety

- Reassignment screws hard with refactoring.
- ""Variables"" should be protected from reassignment by default.
- Reassignable variables should need a keyword like nonfinal or variable.

### No delegates or events

- Delegates and events are insanely useful in C#.

### No dynamic typing

- The dynamic keyword can also come in handy in C#.
- No support for invokedynamic already present in JVM.

### No ref or out parameters

- Native invocations sometimes need them.

### No JSON sugar

- Difficult to construct JSON structures in Java due to the verbose syntax.
- Javascript has the best syntax.

### No native regex

- Have to put regular expressions in strings. Escape hell.
- Perl-style native regex is always welcome.

### Verbose switch syntax

- Break or fall-through is obsolete C legacy.
- Kotlin has much nicer ""when"" syntax.

### No custom blocks

- Many times I felt the need to define custom blocks.
- Why are we limited to if, for, while, and try blocks?
- Unified blocks and lambdas could be very nice.

### Standard style

- Lowercase method names and SCREAMING_ENUM_NAMES are not that legible.
- Braces should be enforced everywhere.
- Parentheses should be enforced everywhere.
- if( condition ) instead of if (condition) because it is more legible with embedded parentheses.

### No support for functional-(style) programming

- Java does not even support expression bodies from C#.
- Numeric types have much nicer syntax with expression bodies.

### No standard dependency injection

### No default arguments

### No named parameters

kkrev,"> The modern jvm is very fast, only barely losing out to hand rolled compiled languages like c/c++ and to a lesser extent go. 

This is really not true. The relative inability to control data layout in memory or explicitly vectorize data operations means any Java code that has to deal with a lot of data is going to be way slower than the equivalent C++ written by someone who knows what they're doing. A Java database or game engine is always going to be a relative pig.

Most of the time it doesn't matter. But I wish people would stop lying and saying that ""Java is fast, just a bit slower than C++."" Totally false. The memory model and relative lack of control over what CPU instructions are generated means critical avenues of optimization are simply not available to Java.",1515957773.0

chisui,"For me it is that language development is slow and mostly misguided. I understand that they don't want break backwards compatibility but it is used as an excuse to not change or add features to the language. Even if these features could be implemented in backwards compatible ways. And when new features are implemented they are intuitive at best and useless at worst. Examples:

#Functions

What java calls functions is actually just a shorthand to create anonymous-inner-classes that implement interfaces with only one method on them. These where hacks used to emulate functions. besides the lambda and method reference syntax it's business as usual. Functions still aren't first class, we only have the `Function` interface, that in itself is nothing special.

Atop of that javas type inference is just not powerful enough to support any real functional programming. You have to cast and add explicit types everywhere. Even if you get it to work you are stuck with unreadable type signatures.

And don't get me started on generic methods.

#Modules

A module system would be cool. You could validate that all required modules are present on startup and have a way to encapsulate code further. Unfortunately one of the biggest causes for dependency conflicts are version conflicts which the java 9 module system doesn't address at all. Even the encapsulation is kind of useless, since reflection is so pervasive that you have to turn the encapsulation mechanism of on any realwolrd system.

#OOP

Writing classes is a pain.

* Getters|Setters have to be written by hand even though there is only one way to write them.
* `equals`|`hashCode`|`toString` have to be written by hand even though even though there are sensible defaults.
* Constructors that only assign their arguments to fields have to be written by hand.
* inherits Stuff from Object that is useless to harmful: `clone`, `finalize`, `wait`, `notify`.
* primitive values aren't Objects.

The first three points can be fixed by something like project lombok but they should be part of the language itself.

Even though you should use composition over inheritance it's much harder to compose objects than to simply extend them. Having language features that support composing objects like delegates would make that much less painful.

#Core Library

The core library is a kitchen sink the size of a football field. There is rot everywhere. Again, this stuff reaches from useless (e.g. CORBA) to actively harmful (e.g. Serialization). There are attempts at splitting these parts of off the core library in java 9 and making it more modular but I didn't have time to look at it yet. Hopefully these kinds of issues are resolved by it.

#Concurrency

It's so easy to shoot yourself in the foot using anything that has to do with thread based concurrency and mutable state. You have to use arcane design patterns when dealing with concurrency like Double-checked locking. Testing is also pretty hard. This isn't a problem with java alone though, many languages have the same problems since most only provide a somewhat thin layer above OS concurrency mechanisms. That said there are more user friendly ways of dealing with concurrency than threads. Luckily some of these can be expressed as libraries so java is capable of using other concurrency paradigms. The native java approach is threads though and the associated APIs have the same problems as everything else in the core libarary.",1516021075.0

tongucyumruk,"JSP is a view technology. It is not a way to implement a whole web application (although, of course you can do it if you really really want to prove a point). You can use JSP with Sprint, Struts or some other framework to implement your views. In that sense they complement each other.

The framework allows you to write your backend code in an efficient and maintainable way. You can then populate your JSP context there and render your JSPs using information on that context.

Again, of course you don't ""have to"" do that, but this allows a nice separation of concerns and results in a more maintainable system.",1515913721.0
RupertMaddenAbbott,"As you have probably already discovered, JSPs allow you to dynamically alter the HTML of your website. For example, instead of having to copy and paste the same chunk of HTML around, you can write a loop and have the same section repeated.

If you have never used a full web framework before (like Spring or Struts) this may seem very sufficient at the moment. For very simple websites maybe it is sufficient.

However, you will quickly encounter things that you want to do that are quite difficult in JSPs. You will start writing code that becomes more and more torturous to change and maintain. If you have never experienced this before, I would strongly encourage you to keep going with JSPs on their own so you can experience this pain for yourself.

Web frameworks will solve these problems for you but they do so at the cost of significant complexity. For those who are used to them, I think it can be difficult to remember how complex they are, when first encountering them. If you never experience the pain of using just JSPs, this complexity can itself seem unnecessary and painful.

Note, you don't need either Spring MVC or Struts to accomplish this. You can use plain servlets as the controller and not use frameworks at all to achieve MVC. But, you'd have to roll your own validation and binding logic, which web frameworks make really convenient.",1516063164.0

Thanks jmeter team!",1515513571.0

> JMeter wins on Project History. The project is significantly older and has more contributors. Both Gatling and JMeter are maintained regularly. JMeter has a significantly bigger codebase (almost 500K lines now, which Gatling tool is much smaller (50K lines of code). Of course, Scala code is more concise than Java code.

Lines of Code is a stupid metric. Full stop. 

Project lifetime is not a useful metric. I mean, why don't we all use Java 1.x instead of Java 8? Java 1 has more lifetime! Same thing with Tomcat vs. Jetty, `java.io` vs `java.nio`, etc. Prioritizing projects based on their age isn't very helpful, and it means you will be forever stuck in legacy land. 

In addition, the number of contributors says nothing of the project's quality. You can end up with 10k contributors by having a whole bunch of pull requests for documentation updates/fixes. 

So this is a useless portion of the comparison, and yet the primary argument that the author is primarily basing his recommendation upon. 

> JMeter has clearly more features than Gatling Tool. This is completely understandable considering both project histories.

If I need SOAP, I can craft SOAP myself as an HTTP RPC. And who's load testing FTP servers? Or IMAP servers? Are those really such compelling use cases? Throw those out, and how many contributors/lines of code go away? Raw feature count is not a useful metric. You need to look at how helpful those features are, how stable they are and how they combine into a suite for your purpose. 

> You’ve probably heard this a million times: the scripting winner depends on your feelings.

>Do you prefer a point-and-click tools or Write Code? Depending on your preference, one tool may be better than the other.

I would argue that the code tool is objectively better. Necessitating a UI means that you need to not just learn the tool and its capabilities, but the UI quirks as well. In addition, your pull requests won't be usable since the XML files aren't meant for humans. Yes, it's code, but it's also a DSL. Most QA engineers these days can write some basic code. 

> Distributed Testing Verdict

> JMeter stands out! Gatling Tool simply doesn’t support distributed testing in the free version.

Again, wat? The entire point of the actor model is that you don't need 1000 threads to model 1000 users. And most actors are not going as fast as they can, they have delays and whatnot built in. If you're attempting to load test your server, you want as many users as possible. With the user-per-thread model, JMeter ***needs*** to be distributed. There are hard limits both in the OS and in the JVM about how many threads you can have online at a time. There is significant performance problems coordinating communication across that many threads. The threads are true OS threads, so they involve a full context switch. That's not free. When your load server is under a heavy CPU load itself, it can affect the results. Gatling's lower CPU usage means that it won't affect the performance results as directly. 

Gatling's innovation is that it doesn't need to be distributed for the most common use cases. And if you're going into the 100,000-1m simulated user range, neither tool is going to be appropriate. 

And the final f-u: 

> JMeter is clearly the winner. With greater number of Features and support for Distributed Testing, JMeter compensates for slightly less performances than Gatling Tool. JMeter’s Longer Presence can be seen with two different point of views:

> ...

> Choosing JMeter or Gatling tool really depends on what you are comfortable with.

,"A good summary. Being a very strong proponent of using Optional to properly type POJO/record/data class fields, I've never found the two first objections to be remotely compelling.

Brian Goetz's opinion seems to be completely inconsistent with his suggestion that it be used in method returns - getters are a method return! The end result seems to be a message like ""strongly type the possible absence of values returned from service methods, but don't you dare have the same strong typing on your data representations"". Why we should embrace strong typing on ""getFooFromDatabase()"" but not on ""foo.getBar()"" has yet to be explained.

His opinion is also inconsistent with his push to add destructuring pattern matching to Java (`Optional` types are perfect candidates for destructured binding!), but I'll hold off on that one to prevent this becoming an essay. ;)

Serializability is a valid concern for those who use it, though given that it's been a security nightmare, is a security nightmare, and will likely continue to be a security nightmare I'm not sure why people do. Effective Java's chapter on serialization pretty much says ""never never never use this"", advice I'm happy to take. And even if you do have to serialize your data classes, just having your getters wrap fields in `Optional` lets you have your cake and eat it too - something [Immutables](https://immutables.github.io/) already does for us automatically.

It's the third and final issue that I think actually has teeth, outdated reflective libraries that can't handle `Optional` types. We've found that using recent versions of maintained libraries has meant we never have any issues with handling `Optional` returning methods or fields. YMMV, of course.",1515443029.0

> nthElement

> Returns the nth element of an array.
>

    public static <T> T nthElement(T[] arr, int n) {
        if (n > 0) {
            return Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, n, arr.length)[0];
        }
        return Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, arr.length + n, arr.length)[0];
    }

This function makes no sense to me.  The nth element in an array, if n is considered to be zero-indexed, is just arr[n].  This is creating a copy of a subrange of an array and immediately throwing that array away.  That copy is a very expensive and unnecessary operation , even as a shallow copy.  It looks like the main intent is to port a negative-index style from another language (where arr[-1] might be arr[arr.length-1]).

This code lumps in n=0 in with the negative indexes, which crashes if called.  nthElement(new Integer[10], 0) results in the second Arrays::copyOfRange call, returning a zero-length array.  Its nonexistent first element is then extracted, causing ""ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0"".  That alone makes it clear that more unit tests are needed.  I see nthElement_return_nth_element_from_start_when_n_is_greater_than_0() and nthElement_return_nth_element_from_end_when_n_is_less_than_0(), but it appears that at least one case is missing from that test coverage!

Further, the languages that support negative indexes (IME) use 1-indexed arrays instead of 0-indexed arrays, so they don't have to deal with confusion between arr[0] and arr[-0].  If this were to support negative indexes, where nthElement(arr, -1) results in arr[arr.length-1], then it would have the weird trait of being 0-indexed for counting numbers and 1-indexed (after sign flip) for negative numbers, but at least it could be simple and more efficient code (though it needs javadocs to describe its actions):

tylerkschrute,"While this demonstrates a pretty competent understanding and usages of streams and functional programming, I'm wondering if these functions would actually be all that useful in practice. Most serve very narrow use cases and do not allow for generics (only ints). For instance, consider this code:

    /**
     * Returns all the distinct values of an array.
     *
     * @param elements ints
     * @return distinct values
     */
    public static int[] distinctValuesOfArray(int[] elements) {
        return Arrays.stream(elements).distinct().toArray();
    }

First of all, this only works for arrays of type int. It would be much more useful as a generic method (along with one that accepts collections API classes).

Secondly, is it really that painful to just go ahead and use the native streams API to do this?

    list.stream().distinct().collect(toList());

I think there is value in limiting the indirection in your code and using as many native APIs as possible, even if having tiny utility methods like this would remove a very small amount of duplication. This oftentimes makes it is easier for other developers to understand and use your code.

Still here?  First, Jasper does work. Mostly we use Jasper as a rapid deployment mechanism - we can load a new Jasper report template into our server without downtime, but we don't have the ability to load arbitrary Java report code on the fly. This balances out the unpleasantness of actually editing the repetitive and error prone jrxml files. We also had to implement report governors to stop users requesting 4000 page datasets.

If your report formats are pretty static, and your code deploys easy, then consider generating CSV files using OpenCSV and PDFs using PDFBox.  PDFBox can express the full capabilities of the PDF format much more directly than Jasper. Everything generates HTML.

I'd look into iText for PDF report generation. It uses classic Java object types for report elements. Way easier to pick up and write. As far as CSV reports go, you can just write your own output file to CSV from Java. You don't really need a reporting library for that, unless you want to get into excel generation, in which case I'd recommend Apache POI.

Lastly, if you're looking for web reports, you can change the context/MIME type of your web page for displaying a web report. We've used application/pdf type to display an in browser PDF viewer for reports from html content.

DannyB2,"I've used Jasper Library for years and love it.

But you need to understand what it is.  It has several parts.

First, there is a data source.  This must present ROWS of data.  There are default implementations for various databases.  Probably also ones that consume CSV / TSV, etc.  These provide rows to the report engine.  You can even use your own custom class that implements the JRDataSource interface to provide rows to the report engine.

Second, the report layout.  This is the JRXML file.  The jrxml is compiled into another form.  You can write the JRXML file using a text editor.  Or use JasperStudio which is a visual designer to let you graphically design the report layout, and produce the JRXML file.  I use the GUI designer to edit layouts.  But sometimes make simple edits directly to the JRXML files in my project.  (For example, a mass search / replace on a SQL column name that changed.  No need to painstakingly do that in the GUI designer.)

Third, the Report Engine.  The Report engine has exactly two inputs:  The data source and compiled report layout previously described.  The report engine then produces output called JasperPrint.  The JasperPrint can be saved to a file in a binary format and later re-read.  The JasperPrint is the pixel-perfect representation of the visual pages printed by the engine.

Next, there are various classes that can consume the JasperPrint and do something with it.

There is a class that can route the JasperPrint to an actual printer.

There is a class that can display the JasperPrint in a Swing window.

There are various JasperPrint classes that can export the JasperPrint to various formats including:  PDF, Word, XLS, XLSX, LibreOffice Writer, LiberOffice Calc, HTML.  Please note that if you export to PDF or Word what you get are beautiful pages that look like the report output.  But if you export to other formats like Excel / LiberOffice Calc, etc, you also get . . . beautiful visual pages that look visually exactly like the report pages.  In other words the Excel output is like a graphical visual version of the report.  It looks like pages.  It is NOT useful for doing spreadsheet operations on.

If you want spreadsheet output, then you should start with the JRDataSource, and simply emit it into a spreadsheet or CSV, or TSV output yourself.

So my reports each have a page with various filters.  Then two buttons at the bottom:  Start Report, or Export Data.

Start Report runs the database query and feeds the result into JasperReport as rows, along with the selected report layout.  Export Data also runs the query but then uses my own code to feed it into either CSV, TSV, or Apache POI to generate Excel output.

Hope that helps.

Sometimes the JDK libraries use coding practices that sacrifice maintainability for speed.

This is called routing. There are many web frameworks for Java (too many almost, a new 'light weight' framework gets created like every week or so ;)) that handles this for you. So if you really want to 'only' use servlets then you are basically building a routing component yourself. 

So your course depends on if you really want to keep using just servlets. Since you appear to be quite inexperienced why not try using a small simple framework like [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/) or [Ninja](http://www.ninjaframework.org/)?

To do what you want, use JSP technology. This will allow you to create web pages with the necessary data.

For example, if you enter the address www.example.com/products/{product_id}, the servlet can return a page with data corresponding to the product with ""product_id"".",1515130075.0

Resumes (and especially claims about work experience) are easy to fake, and you can get a Bachelor's degree in computer science without any actual coding experience.

Ways to get around this:

* Have some serious open source contributions or personal projects in your resume. Include links to public source code repositories and always use your real name in commits. Make sure these projects appear on top if HR googles your name.
* Get found by a head hunter instead of applying yourself. This may let you skip some of the entry-level tests.
* Certificates are stupid, but its always nice to have them. Get your current employer to pay for some advanced training and be sure to apply for a certificate, if available.
* Edit: Know people and let people know that you are a good candidate. Be active in user groups (real meetings, not only mailing lists) or hacker spaces and talk to people. I didn't need to take a single test for my last role. There was barely any interview. The right people already knew I would fit, and HR only had to prepare the paperwork.

We stopped sending out a coding test because a lot of applicants didn't send them back (ie they just disappeared) or they sent back rubbish solutions. Our process is now Resume to HR who does a first pass filter, then you talk to one of the tech leads to check you're not completely full of shit, then we invite you in for a pairing session, if you get passed that, then a final quick talk with the CTO which is pretty much a formality to getting an offer.

We find the pairing session to be much better than the take home test. Applicants can bring in their own laptop if they want, or they can use mine. We even let them choose the language they want to work with since we'll interview anyone with good dev skills. I'll then describe the problem and we then work together on a solution. If the applicant gets stuck, I'll make suggestions to keep things moving. We want to see how you work. When do you make commits, write tests, what gets tested. If you can't remember something like how to open a file, then the browser is already open for you to search (as long as you don't search for ""how do I solve <problem>"") that's how people work, so we want to see it.

rzwitserloot,"Let's tear this down and take it one step at a time.

First of all, this:

    String x = new String();

is a mix of 3 utterly unrelated things. It's shorthand for:

    String x; // variable declaration
    new String(); // create a new instance
    x = (some expression); // assignment.

Let's explain these separately:

`String x;` means: Create a variable, name it 'x', don't initialize it to anything, and restrict this variable to either (A) point at nothing, or (B) point at some object for which the compiler and runime can absolutely 100% guarantee that the thing it is pointing has the type 'String' somewhere in its chain of types. (For example, 'new ArrayList' returns an object that is a j.l.Object, a j.u.List, a j.u.AbstractList, a j.u.RandomAccess, and a j.u.Serializable, and a j.l.Iterable, and more – _EVERY_ interface implementing by it or any supertype, and all the supertypes. An arraylist is ALL those things).



`new String();` means: Go to the heap and create a String object; String (the class) knows how to do it and invoking the string constructor is done as part of this. After this is done, there's a new object on the heap, and we have a pointer pointing at where on the heap this string lives, that's the value of this expression.

`x = (something)` assigns the value of that pointer to the x variable. Now x points at the string so created.

Put it back together and now it's perfectly sensible. Going back to your `ClassA` and `ClassB` stuff, `ClassA a = new ClassB();` does:

1. Create a variable named `a`. Restrict it to point either at nothing, or at an object that is definitely a `ClassA`.
2. Go to the heap and make a new object of type `ClassB` (note, because the definition for ClassB says it `extends ClassA`, all instances of `ClassB` are also of type `ClassA`).
3. Assign the memory location of the object created in step 2, to value `a`. This is a legal move; the compiler can ensure (as can the runtime) that this pointer definitely is pointing at a valid location, and it contains an object which is a `ClassA` (it is in fact an instance of ClassB, and all ClassB's are ClassA's).

This is simply not true. Where do you get this stuff?

There are plenty of monolith applications out there that have a reliable HA backstore (PG/Oracle/redis/whatever) and if the app server goes down the sessions are *NOT* lost.
This is how all good applications worked before the microservices craze.

nutrecht,"Question is; why? Tokens are meant to be used to store information about a user, login state, roles, etc. By storing them client-side you have the benefit that your application becomes stateless. The downside is the overhead of the signing and verifying of the token.

Why would you want to use this for a shopping cart? Shopping cards are probably the last example you'd want to store on the client. Clients typically expect to be able to continue shopping after a while. JWTs should generally have rather short expirations. Clients expect to be able to continue shopping on a different device. JWTs are stored on the client and so would the shopping cart be.

And even if you wanted to store this client side; why not just do that? Shopping cart picks are just user input. There is no reason whatsoever to sign and verify them: you'd verify the totals when the user goes and buys them. No point at all in using JWTs to do this.

JWTs are just a tool and you're treating them as some kind of golden hammer. ",1515063410.0

sazzer,"I've got a toy project I'm working on that has a solution for this. It's not strictly speaking a Microservices architecture - it's a Spring Boot backend and a Create React App frontend. What I've done is:

* Backend builds a Docker container using the dockerfile-maven-plugin
* Frontend is built using Maven - using the frontend-maven-plugin - and also builds a Docker container (using nginx)
* End-to-end tests are written in Node as well (don't hate me) and also build a Docker container
* A Docker Compose setup that
  * Starts the database
  * Starts the backend
  * Starts the frontend
  * Starts a Selenium Hub
  * Starts a Chrome Selenium Node
  * Starts the End to end tests
  * Runs using the ""--exit-code-from"" flag so that when the End to end tests finish the entire cluster shuts down, and the pass/fail of the tests is returned

This works remarkably well. I can build and test the entire stack on my machine against a real database, real deployed services and know that the whole thing works. I've even got the screenshots coming out of the tests using a Docker volume mount. Extending this to microservices would be relatively easy - just add more containers and link them together.

The only part of the entire system that isn't real when testing it this way is the authentication. I'm using Google+ auth at the moment, and I've added in a dummy authentication route so that my end to end tests can run without needing real Google credentials.

I'd recommend to gain experiences with contributing towards one more multiple JSRs and take it from there.

In terms of required time, it's really up to you. I think if a JSR is under active development, i.e. lots of discussions going on, API drafts to be reviewed, APIs to be designed, APIs to be implemented in the reference implementation, tests to be added in the TCK etc., four to eight hours a week gives you enough time to make a difference as a contributor. As a spec lead you'll spend significantly more time than that (it's more or less a full time job in my experience if a JSR is actively developed, and less again once the dust has settled).

One thing to keep in mind is your goal shouldn't be to be part of the JCP for its own sake but rather to improve a spec or the process itself. I've seen some folks being on multiple expert groups without really contributing very much (or anything at all). That's not useful of course.

The `Optional` type was meant for query type methods that might not return a result, where you don't want to return a null that case:

    interface UserDAO {
        Optional<User> findUserById(int id);
    }

which you could have done in the past like this:

    interface UserDAO {
        User findUserById(int id) throws UserNotFoundException;

    String emailAddress = user.getEmailAddress();
    EmailService emailService = EmailServiceFactory.getInstance().getEmailService();
    emailService.email(emailAddress, subject, body);

But this:

    User user = userService.lookupUser(userId);
    user.email(subject, body);

Think about it! Go look at your code today and look how the getXXXXX() methods are used in your application. You'll see its just a bunch of global objects exposing state and the real work getting done in procedural code. Might as well go back to writing in C.

It has an equivalent @RestController to implement REST based APIs.
* Spring boot is a utility for setting up applications quickly, offering an out of the box configuration in order to build Spring powered applications. As you may know, Spring integrates a wide range of different modules in its umbrella, as spring-core, spring-data, spring-web (which includes Spring MVC, by the way) and so on. With this tool you can tell Spring how many of them to use and you'll get a fast setup for them (you are allowed to change it by yourself later on).

Infeligo,"You have two options.

Option 1. Distribute the client in a package and use it as a dependency. This can be done by packaging your client classes into separate module and distributing a compiled JAR via Artifactory or other means. This is even simpler if you have a monorepo. Anyways, the client should be maintained by the same team that produces the API.

One way of creating a client is just to handcraft it with love and care and somehow make sure that it is in sync with the API. 

Another way is tie it to your API somehow. For example, if you use [Spring Cloud Feign](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/multi/multi_spring-cloud-feign.html), you can declare your API as an interface with Spring MVC annotations. You then implement it in a controller class (that will be your service) and also use it to produce a Feign client by extending the interface and adding @FeignClient annotation to it. The distributed part is the API interface.

Option 2. Similarly to WSDL, you describe your API with something like Swagger, RAML or OpenAPI (either automatically or manually) and then *generate* the client code (e.g. using swagger-codegen) for each consuming service. If the API changes, just regenerate it. The benefit of this approach is that you are now truly cross-language and cross-platform. The downside is that the tech is not quite there yet and the generated client might not be... the most elegant one.",1514236849.0

* the number of high quality and well documented open source libraries;
* the number and quality of material found on Internet about Java technologies.

For example, Haskell has many high quality libraries, but they often aren't well documented, and you can't find common Haskell exceptions on StackOverflow.

On Spark (the Scala/Hadoop one) you can have bugs that have no answer on StackOverflow, so you have to find the solution by yourself. That slows down development a lot.",1514240414.0

888808888,"It's not any one specific feature; it's the entire thing, taken as a whole.


Great IDE's, free cost, absolutely massive community and third party libraries, and yes, it DOES run everywhere on every platform, without modification. Java is still king when it comes to that specific feature, sorry.


It is well supported by very large and powerful corporations. As a business, I can be assured the code I write won't be disappearing due to lack of support any time soon. (Can't say the same for rust, go, etc)



It has a very large and capable base library which you can use for pretty much anything. Networking, GUI's (swing), database (jdbc) etc, there is a ton of well written and pretty much bug free code. Though I would say they could have done a better job of offering a simpler API in many cases. It's possible to do complex things (say, in swing), but they could have tried harder to make the normal things a little easier.


I also happen to like the language itself as well. I don't mind the wordiness, the IDE takes care of that, and then for developers READing the code, it's all very clear with no surprises. The compiler handles whole classes of issues that show up in other languages (scripting languages). I have yet, to ever write a single junit test. I know it's out there, and I know what it's there for, but I've never used it and I've been programming professionally since, well, almost 2 decades. To me that's a great strength. 


I can come back to code I wrote 10, 15 years ago, and immediately read it and understand it, with no surprises. I can maintain this code. Be surprised how many languages fail this very simple test. When you make it easy/possible to do complicated and tricky code (c/c++), don't be surprised when new developers come on board and don't have a clue what the heck is going on. The ""wordiness"" of java is a benefit, in my opinion.",1514227363.0
vipul0092,"To me, its the whole Java ecosystem, its so mature as compared to other languages. I havent had trouble finding resouces for anything that I required at my job.. I've used Java at my job for uploading files, image manipulation, rest service calls, soap service calls, xml parsing, sql db connections, multithreading, queuing systems, cron jobs, auth callbacks, serving UI assets, interacting with AWS S3 and I havent faced any problems implementing them, there is always something out there that I can use after customising it a bit for my use case.

And all this without taking a performance or scalability hit, if you write the code correctly, it just works. Ive had one of rest services serving 2500 calls per minute and they run flawlessly.


Plus the whole dependency management system (maven is what Ive used so far) is great, it just works. My productivity is very high when I work with Java as compared to when I majorly coded in C# earlier.

Atello,"As someone who is still very much in the early stages of learning, it seems to me like the most mature while still being relevant in modern implementations. It has decades of information and community support, which has made it an ideal language to learn programming with. If I have a question or get stuck, chances are almost 100% that there is an answer somewhere online.

It also runs on EVERYTHING. I can deploy and test my apps on whatever platform I want. This also adds to accelerate learning since I can immediately encounter the subtle differences in platform and learn to work within them.

I can also easily write automated tests for my web apps (and native mobile apps) by simply adding a framework or two. Nothing specialized needed, just more java code. I don't know if other languages are like this as well but it's super convenient.

Another point is the absolute sea of libraries and frameworks that you can add in seconds to expand your capabilities almost infinitely. Other languages also have this but not to the degree of java, I don't think.

Overall it's just the wealth of knowledge and flexibility that comes with the language. You can do everything with it and if you don't know how, the information exists to show you how.",1514238622.0
dogear,"22 years (and counting) of *relevance* is a pretty good track record for a modern language.

In part, it's because of the continual (if slow by design) evolution of the language itself: annotations, lambdas, modules

It's openness has led to a community hijacking at times (I mean this in the most positive sense) when the ""powers that be"" weren't getting it. (So, Spring & Hibernate bringing a better Java EE than Java EE). While this isn't strictly a language feature, I would say the community and proliferation of frameworks is a contributing factor in its sustained popularity.

The source code from 1996  will also still compile, though you may have to use a compiler switch. And you could just as easily write and compile code on the Java 9 JDK and run it on a Java 1.0 JVM, if you take care to avoid language features and standard API classes not available back then (which would admittedly be a pretty bad experience).
* The practice of having APIs for new features specified through a community process and then have competing implementations leads to a lot less fragmentation of the platform.

As far as the JVM is concerned, `Foo` and `Foo$Bar` are independent classes. So how can `Foo$Bar` get access to private fields of `Foo`?

This has historically been a problem. Earlier, `javac` would silently relax the access level of private fields to have package access. (You should find this disturbing.) More recently, `javac` will create ""bridge"" (synthetic) methods to mediate access to private members. This is better, but among other issues, it converts what should be a simple field access into a method call.

JEP 181 proposes to introduce nesting as a first-class construct known to the JVM, so that `Foo$Bar` is known to the JVM to be nested within `Foo` and not an independent class with a funny name. This in turn allows the JVM to permit `Foo$Bar` access to private members of `Foo`, without the need for `javac` to create bridge methods and such.",1514056563.0

For college kids there is no point to learn jee. You should be learning that stuff on the job or in internships. You should be making things, but learning frameworks isn't the goal. It's learning how to make projects from start to finish and in a team that is important.

Second I would say jee has a lot of bad parts. Javaee has grown too much and standard spring too complex. It's reached a complexity that is necessary due to mismanagement at the standard Enterprise architecture level. If you are using good architecture the more complicated parts of spring and javaee are not necessary. Spring boot is a step in the right direction in my opinion. If you need more complexity than spring boot, I think in most cases it's your architecture that needs to change (with exceptions). Get out of the monolithic hell and it's much easier.",1513922538.0
otakuman,"JavaEE has a steep learning curve. Furthermore, without an adequate guide, advancing from simple Java hello worlds to a relatively easy web app can be seen as an impossible task. Personally, I had to spend over a thousand dollars for courses on JavaEE, Spring, hibernate and Oracle PL/SQL, and even those paid courses felt inadequate when I had to work on a live system. From my viewpoint, learning Java EE on your own is a titanic task. I graduated around 2000, and in my ignorance I thought that learning PHP and MySQL was enough for industry needs.

I only learned JavaEE until my mid thirties. Then, after you learn, you're at the mercy of project pacing. You can get stagnated for years, depending on your boss or the projects that the company is accepting. I spent 2 to 3 years stuck with JSF. In my early 40s, I'm still learning.

Infeligo,"This guy talks about spherical business logic in vacuum, but that's never the case in the real word.

1\. Business logic can be complex and I would like to have all the power of universal language like Java plus its frameworks and libraries to implement it. Inheritance, composition, components,  IoC, design patterns, configurability, testability, etc. Sorry, but even if PL/SQL has some potential to do that, it is just not there yet.

2\. Business logic can depend on external stuff. How will database handle thousands of calls to remote API-s and loading tons of JSON-s to extract necessary data? Isn't it wasting license money if your database server CPU is busy waiting for a HTTP response instead of doing work?

If you suggest to handle remote calls in the application and extract core logic to stored procedures, then this is possible only as part of the hybrid approach. You might be able to implement domain rules like that, but not the entire flow of use-cases.

3\. Tooling and lifecycle management for PL/SQL code sucks compared to Java word and this _is_ an issue and this _will_ cost you money if your developers are not productive.

So, if RDBMs would offer us a proper language, standard library and tooling, I would look at it from another angle. But today we are where we are.

cogman10,"Interesting conclusions but I would actually disagree with them (slightly).

1. Overhead of JDBC can't be understated.  There is a huge cost to establishing new connections and sending/receiving data over those connections.  That being said, you need to temper that reality with the fact that the bigger the requests, the more you decrease general DB concurrency.  DBs are often shared resources, as such, you don't want to put too much work or logic in them.
2. Http requests should NOT be batched together (like, at all).  For a few reasons.
  1. Batches are harder to cache.  The smaller the data chunk the more effective Http caching
  2. Batches end up putting a lot of pressure on one server.  Not great if you are trying to load balance.
  3. You can always do requests concurrently.  Http 1.1 allows for OK concurrency of requests, Http 2 is frankly awesome for them.  In http 2, the actual overhead for your requests are peanuts compared to the performance gains available to you for parallel processing on the server.
  4. You can and should batch up like requests to the DB to get higher and manageable throughput.  If you have a ""User"" endpoint that returns one user, wait for a couple milliseconds for requests to come in for ""User"" and then send those requests to the DB in one batch.  You may slightly slow down an individual request but you will massively speed up everything else on an aggregate.
3. Logic belongs outside of the database.  I can't overstate this.  The DB is a shared resource and you'll regret putting a ton of logic there.  It is almost always harder to expand DBs than it is to expand applications.

The company I'm working at now is paying the price for putting too much in the database and it isn't a fun one.  The first approach was one that tried to minimize the number of requests to the database (multiple select statements in one query, dynamically built of monster queries, etc).  But ultimately, those things make it harder to evolve the application.  Further, the mega queries have a tendency to lock up a bunch of resources which prevents other parts of the app from making progress.

So, this isn't to say don't batch things.  Definitely do that.  But rather that you need to think of things in terms of multiple DB actors.  The more tables you join, the more rows you update, the longer the query runs, the more you will end up blocking other processes from doing their job.",1513804347.0

It does, and if it doesn't you certainly wouldn't be asking us about it, you'd know.

2. JPA is a Java EE standard, and Hibernate is an implementation of it. Whatever you've learned there should translate.

2.5. It's not necessary to know all the parts of Java EE at once. The ones you need to learn have a way of smacking you in the face, often with a few pages of stack traces. See, especially, ""no-I-don't-need-that-to-run-transactionally."" :P

3. Frontend is frontend, and there are tons of ways of interfacing with backend, so ... Java EE supports them all. SOAP with JAX-WS, RESTful stuff with JAX-RS, direct websocket connections, AJAX to call the other stuff using JSF (some people hate JSF, but I think that they're still stuck in early JSF-land, when you should hate it), and even tons of ways to mix in things like Bootstrap with BootFaces, etc. In a really big environment, you're likely to see good separation of frontend and backend.

3. Spring Boot is mostly a way of trying to get rid of the hassle and complexity of configuring an application server. Something I read recently was about how a very few, small number of programmers get to write new stuff using the newest tech, and lots end up doing (at least some) maintenance. If you do maintenance, you WILL end up dealing with application servers, and I don't see that as bad. Some are better than others. Look at Wildfly/JBoss EAP/Tomee for Java EE ""Full Profile"" (and maybe IBM's new Liberty WAS), and Wildfly/JBoss EAP for ""Web Profile."" If you just need a servlet container, without several of the server-managed-and-mediated things, Tomcat/Undertow/Jetty would be options.

It's probably more important to get the big picture here - IMO - rather than the deep-down bits of each and every one of these. You can do that when/if you USE one of them for something; until then, you're learning things that will likely be obsolete/changed by the time you need them. The ""**big picture**"" on the other hand moves slowly, and you'll start to be able to see the changes and directions it's flowing.

4. Down to your criteria, demand is a fickle whore. Interviews are about selling you and some combination of what-you-already-know and what-you-can-do-or-could-know-if-you-needed-to, which is a good part of why soft skills matter so much. Re: ""climbing the ladder,"" make sure you know where you want the ladder to end. If you don't want to be managing people eventually, for example, you'll probably go a bit different direction in keeping up with tech than if you were planning that move to management. The big picture is still important, both ways, though - the people who make really stupid mistakes make them because they don't know that the mistake was stupid, often from not knowing where their ""thing"" they're working on fits into the whole.

thephotoman,"While people have said, ""learn topics, not frameworks"", it might be useful to know *what* topics you need to learn:

* Dependency injection: this is the big selling point of Spring and JavaEE.  In fact, it's a big part of why they exist: companies wanted the ability to plug in small, company-specific modules into large, commercial, off-the-shelf products that did most of the heavy lifting.  We've taken it a few steps further since then.
* Object-relational mapping: Java's database interface tools are shit.  Most Java guys hate databases for that reason.  Both Spring and JavaEE provide object-relational mappers to try to alleviate some of the pain of interfacing with databases.  
* Batch jobs: This is somewhat newer in JavaEE, but Spring has a batch architecture.  Batch jobs are everywhere in large businesses.  There are just things you really want run at night, because you want to, for example, send out a hundred thousand letters a day, each to separate people containing tailored content.  Or maybe you're getting a daily feed of items being scanned into or out of a warehouse.  Or maybe you're getting HR feeds involving payroll data.  I've done *all of this stuff personally*.
* Web service design: Focus on RESTful web design at first.  It's in higher demand simply because of its reduced conceptual overhead (also, the fact that Javascript doesn't balk at it in any way).  
* Build automation.  Pick one: Maven or Gradle.  Pick one: Jenkins, Gitlab, Bitbucket.  
* The basic architecture of a Java server product: what are WARs and EARs, what do they contain, and why do you care?

There are also things you probably shouldn't sweat:

* Message driven architecture: This is an advanced concept, and in my opinion, JavaEE just does it better.  This isn't to say that JMS is necessarily *good*, but it's just not something you should care about at first.
* JSP.  Honestly, it's a bit old hat at this point, and most apps are moving to a single dummy JSP that serves up a Javascript-driven frontend.  As much as I hate Javascript, I can't say that this idea is *wrong*.
* Anything that involves direct use of servlets.  If you're not implementing JavaEE, you shouldn't care about servlets directly.

Now, cards on the table:

I'm a JavaEE guy.  I think it's amazing stuff.  This is not intended to disparage Spring.  Spring has a Spring Way of doing things, and as a result presents a very consistent set of APIs.  JavaEE is more about standardizing the APIs of popular--even best-in-class where possible, and sometimes even meaning copying Spring wholesale--libraries and frameworks, then letting individual implementers have their way with it.  In theory, changing JavaEE vendors shouldn't be too hard.  In practice, it depends on how much implementation-specific behavior you're using.",1514005456.0

almson,"People should not ignore the IDE's role in language design. The IDE is the user-friendly co-compiler to the language, and should be prominent in thinking about possibly burdensome safety features enabled by static analysis. It offers a middle ground.

It is imperative that all exceptions that could be thrown by a method are documented, and the IDE should propagate them up and warn when the documentation and the code do not match. At the same time, these can be treated as warnings that can be fixed if time and code structure allows, not something to beat the programmer over the head with.

Regardless, there are three dimensions to exceptions:

- Can they be prevented? Non-preventable exceptions usually relate to concurrency. File system errors fall into this category, because a file can go missing immediately after checking that it exists. Preventable exceptions should not be checked exceptions. Eg, string.getBytes(""UTF-8"") is supremely annoying. It will never throw UnsupportedEncodingException.
- How often will they occur (as a percent of calls)? The more likely an exception is, the more important it is to deal with it. OutOfMemoryError can occur anywhere, but almost never does.
- How likely is the caller to recover from it? Most callers cannot recover from OutOfMemoryError, except close to the top of the call chain. The same is true for many programming errors (eg IllegalArgumentExceptions).

The non-preventable, frequent, and recoverable errors are the ones that benefit most from being checked Exceptions, but it is pretty rare for all three qualities to align. Rare, unrecoverable exceptions should be Errors. Preventable exceptions should be prevented, and not dealt with at all.

The interesting insight is that these qualities depend on the *use* of a method more often than on the declaration of it. Therefore, an ideal situation is really one in which a method declares all the things that can go wrong, but the caller (or static analyzer) filters and qualifies them.

Try, catch, and re-throw can be used for just that. But the block nesting it forces is decidedly ugly. I can imagine comments or some IDE UI for documenting on a call-by-call basis the problems that the invocation will have, and feeding that into a declaration of the problems the method might run into.

More practically, I stick to declaring all preventable errors as unchecked exceptions (and documenting them), frequent unpreventable ones as checked exceptions, and programming errors (which, by their nature, are unrecoverable) as assertion errors. What to do with infrequent, unpreventable, recoverable errors is less clear, but convenience dictates that they should be unchecked exceptions.",1513779028.0

That said, it's sometimes helpful to translate the `JPAException` from the persistence layer (say) into a `UserNotFoundException` in the service layer, so that the failure is classified and contextualised in useful ways. It comes down to what kind of signalling you need between parts of the system; in a chain of callers A->B->C, unchecked exceptions are the only way to send an exception signal from C back to A without B having to declare an interest.",1513790619.0
DuncanIdahos8thClone,"The problem with checked exceptions is that that were included within the Java API itself. If checked exceptions were left to to domain level, no one would have had anything to say about them. That would have been the correct way you would usually use them.

Consider something like an SQL exception. There are many reasons you could have this exception. It's a catch-all where most of the time is unrecoverable.  Invalid Operation (like forward only resultset and moving backward) or  Query syntax error. 

Hindsight is 20/20 but really JDBC should have made SQL Exceptions mostly runtime and made them unchecked except for a business rule violation in the DB.

SQLConnectionException - runtime

SQLOperationException - runtime

SQLQueryException - runtime

SQLViolationException - checked

- the server performs the request, and once done calls the client on the previous URL

Another possibility: Use WebSockets - the client connects to the server using a websocket, the client sends the request over the websocket, the server keeps track which client sent which request and responsds on the open connection.

* Both libraries can be used for reactive programming in java.
* Both implement the same specification which is called [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org) so they are interoperable.
* The same specification is also part of the standard JDK 9 - but under a different package/namespace: [java.util.concurrent.Flow](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html)
* RxJava is the more mature library - requires only Java 6 to work.
* Reactor is the newer library - developed by the same team who works on Spring. It requires Java 8 to work.

understanding_ai,"This is really great to see. SVM is pretty magical: you give it a Java app in, and it spits out a tiny binary as the output (few megabytes for normal sized programs) in just a few seconds. The resulting program has no startup time overhead and starts as quickly as a C program would! But wait, that trick doesn't just work for Java programs. If you feed a Truffle interpreter into it, you get a JIT-compiling VM for your target language that also starts as fast as the best competitors.

The entire thing is written in Java and from a quick browse of the code seems very cleanly done. Lots of comments, logical code structure, good use of annotations and compiler-recognised types. This could quickly become a force to reckon with, it should open JVM hacking up to a much larger developer pool than Hotspot can reach. And it should be a major competitive win vs Go, as now Go-style statically linked and minified binaries are easy to produce.

A few ideas for projects that spring to mind:

* IDE plugins to create native binaries out of a project without having to leave your editor.
* Make the GC aggressively collect in the background when idle and free memory back to the OS. Java programs aren't as memory hungry as people tend to believe but HotSpot hardly wants to give memory back to the OS (because it's optimised for runtime benchmarks), so heap usage can bloat up and up until it uses huge amounts of RAM for no good reason.
* Add support for a thin desktop toolkit like SWT. Combined with the idea above, now you can make managed, standalone desktop apps with minimal memory usage too.
* Experiment with new GC designs like per-thread GCs for very low latency desktop/mobile oriented collectors.

As you mentioned JDBC is blocking and that isn’t likely to change anytime soon. There has been talks of Async JDBC but who knows when that will come if ever, and what database vendors will support it.

Non Blocking + Blocking =Blocking. If an application is mostly performing blocking I/O operations (such as JDBC) you may not see any benefit from the reactive programming model. You should always do blocking operations on a separate thread / thread pool with reactive programming, or you defeat the purpose of being reactive. 

Before going down the reactive route a team should ask themselves if it make sense for us to use reactive programming model?

The first code seems unnecessary hard to read.

    public int function getResult(int month, int day) {
        if (month == 1) {
            if (day == 31) {
                return 100;
            } else {
                return 200;
            }
        } else if (month == 2) {
            if (day == 28) {
                return 300;
            } else {
                return 400;
            }
        } else {
            return 500;
        }
    }

Or if you like ternary operators:

    public int function getResult(int month, int day) {
        if (month == 1) {
            return day == 31 ? 100 : 200;
        } else if (month == 2) {
            return day == 28 ? 300 : 400;
        } else {
            result = 500;
        }
    }

Or if you *really* like short code:

    public int function getResult(int month, int day) {
        if (month == 1) return day == 31 ? 100 : 200;
        else if (month == 2) return day == 28 ? 300 : 400;
        else result = 500;
    }

Seems quite manageable. Note that I don't doubt the usability, but the example.

 > As we prepare to enhance the Java Language to support pattern matching, several irregularities of the existing switch statement -- which were always an irritation to users -- become impediments. These include handling of nulls (a switch statement throws NullPointerException if its argument is null) and that the current switch works only as a statement, but it is frequently more natural to express multi-way conditionals as expressions.

So, the `switch` statement is going to be *replaced* instead of improved? I mean, fixing that `NullPointerException` would already go a long way...now if we also could something like this:

    switch (value) {
        case ""something"": return true;
        case ""otherthing"": return true;
        case null: return true;
        default: return false;
    }

That would be great. Now if we could treat the cases like ifs, that would be awesome:

    switch (enumValue) {
        case VALUE_A && isCorrect():
            // Some logic.
            break;

        case VALUE_B && !isCorrect():
            // Some other logic with fallthrough.
        
        case VALUE_C:
            // More logic.
    }

Hot damn, that would even allow abuse like this:

    switch (true) {
        case isSomeOption():
            // Some logic.
            break;

        case isSomeUser():
            // Some logic.
            break;

        case isStupid():
            // Some logic.
            break;
    }

I mean, I see that the `switch` expression really adds something, but can't we fix and improve the `switch` statement first?

> JSON parsing library to load the data into HashMaps and ArrayLists.

So `Map<String, Object>` and `List<Object>`? The contained element type may vary so you can't use anything better than `Object`. Might as well time travel to 2000 and use a raw `List` then. Not sure how you imagine such data structure would be navigated without being completely overrun by `instanceof` and casting? Using library-specific collections at least provides less ugly looking ways to navigate the same structure dynamically.

---

All in all, I find POJOs superior to the alternatives. They at least provide type-safety within the bounds of my code, making only the data binding possibly problematic if the class doesn't match. Using the other approaches just builds on top of magic string constants all throughout the codebase that must match what the incoming JSON contains so when there's an error, it happens somewhere deep in my code, not at the edge of it. Also, POJOs make code completion etc possible, which is incredibly useful compared to having to look up some API responses to check what is there.",1513000479.0

One of the selling points that the company used was that all of its employees were Oracle certified (and while the company preferred it being in specific products in the suite, they were okay with OCPJP since that meant certification in *something*). Of course, that also meant the company paid for the certification.

At my current job, I am the only Java developer out of about 40 who has OCPJP 7. I know of two employees who have older certifications like for Java 5 (back when it was a Sun certification), but have no interest in updating. And this is even in the education sector where you'd think they'd really value services like this. I still choose to keep it up though since I find it personally motivating to help learn the features (others may have ways that work for them).

Personally, I think the questions to ask are, in order:

 1. Is this something that will personally motivate me to learn what I want to know.
 1. Does the industry I work in value these certifications.
 1. Does my company offer partial or complete reimbursement for these certifications (if the above is yes, then probably).

If the answers are yes, then probably just go with whichever will be most valuable for the industry, or the Java EE / master certifications if you think that they will personally motivating to you.

Since there are a lot more pitfalls to take into account when it comes to data or value classes, it makes sense to use Google Immutables to have them generated for you according to best practices so you only have to worry about what attributes they should have and not how they should work.

`Optional`, though, may become more main stream when value types arrive on the scene, seeing that they are not nullable.",1512510354.0
jonhanson,"Where in the StackOverflow answer does Goetz say Optional should not be used as a return type for a ""getter""?

A get method could easily meet this criteria.",1512511928.0
nutrecht,"In out current project we use it everywhere for methods of services and repositories that might or might not a result. It's combines both null-safety and documentation and I personally really like it. 

You're mentioning 'getters' but that is in fact somewhere where we typically do not use it. We have domain classes and DTO's in our system and all the getters/setters are handled there by Lombok. Most of the domain classes/DTO's are immutable (the DTO's are just there to be serialised from/to JSON).

While I do see that the distinction between 'methods' and 'getters' is a bit arbitrary I think that's where you're confusing the 'against them' bit. I am also against using them on POJO/Domain classes/DTO's because there it's not really worth it. I'm very much in favour of them on methods that return objects that might or might not be there based on external circumstances (database, service calls). I'm against using them as method parameters for obvious reasons.",1512548857.0
lslah,"I follow this guide:

1. If possible, make your attributes/getters non-optional, i.e. neither return null nor Optional. E.g. if no caller can do something useful without a value or if it's possible to always construct your object with sane non-null values.

2. If your attribute can be absent, use Optional instead of nullable methods. It's superior, since it's type-safe. Your compiler won't let you use an empty value, where a real value is needed. You have to explicitly  unpack the value, hopefully using one of map, ifPresent, getOrElse instead of get. But in my opinion even get with a preceding isPresent is better than a null-check, as you can't accidentally skip it.",1512540187.0

Goofybud16,"I personally don't care for Optional.

My stand on null checking is that the null should be checked by whoever is dereferencing it. When you start adding Optional<T> all over, suddenly you have to null check the optional before you can hand just the object off to older code. 

In addition to that, an Optional<T> can still be null, so to truly be 100% NPE safe, you need to check the optional itself. Plus you have to null check the contents of the optional before you can use it [or it may NPE], so it really doesn't save you any hassle over just doing your null checks in the first place. I find it just adds code and more things to go wrong.

I think something better than Optional<T> would be adopting some of Kotlin's null operators. Things like the ability to (at the language level) declare something non-nullable which enforces compile-time null checks [where appropriate], the ?. operator, and the ?: operator. I would much prefer

    Something some = someList.stream().map(someObj -> someObj?.someGetter()).filter(Objects::nonNull).findFirst() ?: SANE_DEFAULT;

than

    Something some = someList.stream().filter(Objects::nonNull).map(someObj -> someObj.someGetter()).filter(Objects::nonNull).findFirst().orElse(SANE_DEFAULT);

I find that, after briefly writing Kotlin, I constantly feel like I'm banging my head against the wall when doing null checks, conditional null checks, etc in Java. I'd much prefer to do `potentiallyNull?.potentiallyNullValue()?.getTheValueIWanted()` than null checking each step [which I end up doing in Java].",1512543137.0

trydentIO,"Actually once you understood Optional you'll find it much better as returning-type than inner-fields or method parameters, just for the sake of clean code 

Using Optional for inner-fields or method parameters decreases code readability for... well... nothing, since any object instance in Java may be null, even Optional itself so in such cases it does not add any chance to avoid nullability. It instead tries to mitigate the problem if you use it as returning-type, because of this you are more or less forced to check if the value inside is valid or not and do some operations on it (and you know if a method retrieves a valid result or not). 

Some dev.'s try to use Optional as inner fields for a POJO in order to say which fields are required (non-Optional) or not (Optional), but frankly speaking non-nullable fields should be supported by language natively and this kind of solution is just a trivial and misleading workaround. It is the same for method parameters.

Obviously, it could just be that I suck, but it seems that other people control the annotations for your XML and you're forced to use them.

I'm currently working with a very large company's API.  They were kind enough to provide XSDs.  I'm able to create Pojos from the XSDs, no problems thus far.

But when I get into serializing requests, lots of the request objects that I'm posting aren't annotated with @XmlRootElement, so they won't transcode.  The only way I can do it is to wrap then with in a JAXBContent node with a Qname that matches what it should be (https://largecompany.com, and 'Request', respectively) and then send across an HttpEntity of type string, but with Content header of application/xml. 

This really isn't isolated... I just tend to end up in ridiculous situations when using XML for transport.  I think JAXB is decent at what it does, but at the end of the day it's too rigid.  At least with Jackson and JSON I can pick and choose how I want the objectMapper to behave when things go awry... or create mixins when the code I'm trying to transport isn't mine, but won't transcode.

Other weird things happen too, where JAXB both assumes a public getter alludes to a field that should be transcoded, but will duplicate mappings if you've also tagged the field itself with an annotation.
