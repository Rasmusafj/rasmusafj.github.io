rainmakerraw,"On Unix-like OS it's generally /tmp and /var where non-critical files are stored. That said, Unix-like OS (including macOS) are incredibly efficient and keep themselves 'clean' and running well by default. Messing around by randomly deleting files and/or running 'cleaners' can actually do more harm than good. For example the 'maintenance scripts' that most cleaners offer to run actually includes running the monthly log generation script, which actually creates files. It's snake oil. 

Just leave macOS to do its own thing, honestly. Unix, Mac, Linux, BSD et al. are not Windows. They don't suffer 'bit rot'/registry rot/filesystem fragmentation in the way Windows does, and they don't need a user to 'fix' them.",1543616455.0
MrGonz,"I sort of agree with /u/pah-tosh here. Files and images in /var are uuuuuusually ok to delete but I wouldn't do so preemptively. I do like Onyx and Onyx will clean our /var fairly safely but it takes away the responsibility of knowing what you're doing when messing around in the system directories. That's ok if you're getting down and dirty on some client machine and you don't have time to diagnose and you're going for the Hail Mary. 

On a Mac, the usual culprit is multiple sleep images or swap files (/var/VM). If you have just one of each, leave it alone. Often ""/var/db"" and ""/var/log"" can get large, both I would typically leave alone. As for potential malicious content, nothing should be executing from /var in general but a baddie could potentially store some data there. Unless you are on a rotational drive, there is no performance impact caused by the number of files here. However, if it gets messy it may hurt performance. The best way to ensure that things don't get messy is to leave it alone. This discussion would be a little bit different if we were talking about a server.

shinratdr,"1. Text is almost always displayed as black, so showing you how it looks in white might not give you a great idea of how it's going to look on paper or on other computers. I would say feature.

2. 3rd party developers that make .prefpanes have to update their .prefpanes to support dark mode. Oracle hasn't yet with Java, hence why it looks like that. Not a bug or a feature, just expected behavior. Apple deliberately chose to not override developers on this one, as they typically do, because if they do, then lazy devs will take that to mean they don't actually need to think about how their app looks in Dark Mode, Apple will just do it for them.

3. Ditto number 2. Most developers are fundamentally lazy. If they don't have to do something, they won't. So if you do something 90% of the way for them, most of them will just leave it at that 90%. However if you don't do it at all and let users harass them to support new features, they will actually implement the feature well.

This is classic Apple, they are always playing developer psychology. It's why iPhone apps on iPad display in a little frame instead of just being auto-stretched. If they did that they would have ended up in the same situation as Android where all tablet apps are basically stretched phone apps because, ""meh, it's good enough"". If you give developers a loophole they will almost always take it.

That being said, When I did the upgrade from HS to Mojave, battery life was pretty crappy. So I decided to take the time to do a clean install. Since doing this, battery life has been on par with HS. 10.14.1 didn't really make a noticeable improvement or decline in battery life.



Now, *THAT* being said, I have had one instance where I closed the lid on my Mac, left it alone overnight with ~80% battery (not plugged in), woke up, and it was completely dead. Battery was completely drained. Oddly enough my friend who has a 2017 nTP MBP had the exact same thing happen a few weeks after upgrading to Mojave. I've only had it happen once though, so *shrug*.



Keep in mind this update to 10.14 is the first one in 2 or 3 years that they raised the minimum requirements, thus cutting off certain year Macs from upgrading. This increase in processor requirements coupled with the aging batteries in our systems means battery life will suffer.

Pro tip: Eyesight of your father is poor. So a high quality picture will matter much less to him than just a bigger picture. Get yourself a used 32""+ full HD TV with HDMI input. All the usual downsides of using a TV as a monitor don't apply to your father (worse reaction time, slightly blurry image) but he benefits from all the upsides (much, much cheaper when bought used, integrated speakers, huge screen).

Then get him a full-sized USB keyboard (you can pick them up used for a few dollars) and finally a pointing device. The latter is the most difficult decision. A mouse may not be ideal with limited hand coordination (clicking while holding the position is not a trivial tasks for some people, correctly callibrated mouse acceleration can help). Maybe a nice, large Wacom tablet would be easier to use for him? Or maybe a trackball?

The TV and keyboard you can pick up with a total <100$ if you wait for the right deal (look out for TVs with defect internal receivers if you want a bargain). The pointing device might be rather expensive -- depending on which route you'll take. In doubt, you can always pick up a cheap, decent mouse for <20$.

Source: During my ""Zivildienst"" (compulsory community service), I worked in an elderly home and spent some of my time setting up IT solutions (on a budget) for elderly people with various disabilities. If you ditch your usual assumptions about how a PC setup is supposed to look and function and instead focus on how it might best work for your given client, it's quite astonishing what you can achieve even on the tightest budget. (This doesn't really apply to you but may be interesting to other people stumbling upon this thread: The Raspberry Pi is an absolute killer machine for these purposed. You can easily wire switches to them that launch all the functions your client wants to use, you can set up pedals as mouse buttons if they lack the dexterity to click mouse buttons, etc...)",1543352547.0

If your father is already used to the trackpad, are there any issues against getting an Apple Magic Trackpad for using in clamshell mode?

The nice thing is that he doesn't need high resolution, he just needs a big screen. Everybody is now dumping their old 2K HDTVs after they buy a 4K TV, so you should be able to pick up a 1080p TV over 30 inches for pretty cheap these days, even new. (720p would be even cheaper, but some software requires more vertical resolution than that.) Any recent 15-inch MBP will be able to easily drive that monitor, the graphics hardware is capable of driving much more resolution than that.

I know you said you wanted to avoid Bluetooth problems, but I'm not sure how many non-Bluetooth external trackpads are out there. If you are using a Bluetooth keyboard or trackpad with the MacBook Pro, you can leave the MBP closed, as long as you go into Bluetooth preferences, click Advanced, and turn on ""Allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer.""

### I don't understand, why are you doing this? 

Before we worked with a white list we got a lot of spam on this subreddit, together with vote manipulation this caused the quality of the subreddit to go down. 

### How do I get this domain white-listed? 

We will always keep an eye on what domains get submitted, if a certain domain gets approved consistently we will add it to the white list. We also frequently ask the community to give feedback on the list, we do this through a monthly feedback thread.

kbh987,"In Finder when using List View you can expand folders by clicking the little arrow icons to the left of the folder. It will even save your settings for each folder. However, I've found that when I come back to a folder and single-click a filename under one of the expanded folders, it acts like I am trying to rename the file versus actually select it. Ultimately this makes the expanded list view useless. 

Trying to set consistent folder views in Finder is apocalyptically confusing. To this day I don't understand what ""set as defaults"" actually does. The only thing that seems to work is using Automator. 

Safari...so many websites and extensions seem to not function properly. I do not understand how it's a viable alternative to Chrome yet I keep trying to give it chance. Never last more than 20 min before I'm back in Chrome. 

Finally, nit-picky as hell, but I feel forced to autohide the dock. Reason being, if I zoom an app window to take up my whole screen, sometimes the bottom of the window will align perfectly with the top of the dock. Other times, it will be like 1 pixel below the top of the dock. So if that window is for example white, then I open a darker window on top of it, there's a big white line at the bottom.

Given the ports on this monitor, which appear to be mDP (1), DP (2), HDMI (1), your options seem to be to use a mDP <> DP cable or adapter to get the full benefit. The HDMI Port (HDMI <> HDMi) would give you 1920x1200 but a mDP port would give you up to 2500x1600 or in this case, 2560 x 1440. HDMI ports in the newer model Minis can drive higher resolution (5k I believe) because they are HDMI 1.4 or 2.0, but the '12 model uses an older 1.2 or 1.3 HDMI standard.

About two years ago I came into possession of a used iPhone 5 with iOS 10, after spending years with a pretty rudimentary Android phone, and developed a taste for it, buying a new iPhone SE a year later. A few months after that I replaced my Samsung Galaxy Tab with an iPad, was even more impressed with that, and was *really* impressed by the ability to have the same apps and files available to me on both mobile devices, with interfaces capable of using the strengths of each device. A few months after that I decided that I'd gradually grown less interested in digging into the guts of my operating system as a hobby---I pretty much had all my apps and OS components working the way I liked 'em---and at the same time found myself considering a new laptop. A MacBook was pretty much a no-brainer: a polished, BSD-based OS that let me keep old habits while solving old problems.

Since I bought the MacBook I've seen folks opine that Mac seems to be on a very slow decline, citing minor annoyances they've experienced with their systems. But most of the complaints I've seen are aesthetic or convenience problems that up 'till now I've never even had the opportunity to have, because my operating systems never had those conveniences or tiny graphical details to break in the first place.",1543196128.0

vitalyx,"For me computer is a laptop, I use mac laptops because I had to use one for work and I started liking it for:

1) size, weight and battery life (this power in a laptop that's 18mm thin was pretty spectacular 5 years ago)

2) at the time (2013) it was one of the only laptops on the market with an HDPI display and PCIe SSD

3) touchpad is actually usable (Windows laptops didn't have precision touchpad drivers back then)

4) many development tasks (I'm a SWE) are simplified with a Unix-like system

5) many developers use macs already, it's not rare tools get macOS support first

6) I like the simplicity of it, my favorites are Time Machine, built-in system-wide Dictionary, Handoff/AirDrop/Universal Clipboard, RAW files from DSLRs are supported out of the box in any app, including Finder previews; other pre-installed and useful software like iWork suite, GarageBand, Books, etc.

T3RM2,"I ""switched"" (I still use Windows at home, all of my production servers run FreeBSD or some flavor of Linux depending on purpose) around May 2017 after eyeing better development environments since I'm a full stack developer and IT manager. I wanted a laptop but didn't want to deal with hardware compatibility issues and missing features of the laptop if I used Debian or Arch. So, I went with an early 2015 13"" MBP because Apple destroyed every version after, imo. 3 USB-C ports and dongles aren't exactly what I see as a ""Pro"" solution, the laptop needs to be a Swiss army knife because of what I do.

I wouldn't necessarily call it an upgrade, but it's Unix and that really helps with development requirements. MacOS is not intuitive in certain places - I still can't get around stacking windows. Fortunately, I have an MX Anywhere 2S that really helps where I have the middle button below the scroll wheel bound to mission control. The window manager in some cases is nice too - I LOVE moving my IDE to a full screen independent desktop and switching to it back and forth with gestures. My favorite hardware feature of the laptop is the trackpad. With gestures (and the faux click), it's an absolutely flawless piece of hardware and a testament of what Apple can do. And MacOS is pretty great too..... WHEN EVERYTHING WORKS PROPERLY. I use features of the OS that a majority of people probably don't use (shared networking being one of them) and find that every major update breaks something with SMB and it takes Apple a few months to fix it. I learned quickly after High Sierra to wait until at least *.3 and maybe they've fixed everything by then. But maybe I didn't learn, I did it again with Mojave and they've broken SMB pretty well just like they did in High Sierra. Severely hinders my work and Apple really shouldn't release and then test after the release. That's life though and at this point I've come to expect it from Apple.

When this Mac dies or the hardware starts to go bad, I will not be upgrading to a new MBP or anything equivalent. It's too expensive and the IO is awful, so I'll probably be going to an XPS or a ThinkPad Carbon X with Arch installed. Arch is really pushing the envelope with their release cycle, and I find most hardware works great out of the box with it. Plus, I'm not planning on selling my kidney for one of these machines that have dated hardware and almost non-existent IO with another dongle I have to carry around.

Tl;dr - Overall, great experience. Would I do it again today? Probably not, but for now it's suiting my needs. I'll ride this laptop out until I can't anymore and then I'm probably not coming back to Apple/MBP until they start being truly innovative again, bring back the IO ports on the MBP, and stop beta testing new stable releases with my machine.

That's all from a power user. :)",1543259162.0

It didn’t have to index in either of these cases since it was just a restore but I’ve wiped spotlight and re-indexed before and it took a couple days. Your situation does sound extreme as far as the length of time. My SSD is only 256gb so not a ton of ground to cover.

Apart from security bug fixes, the security features in Mojave are refinements of what already exists.  I would suggest key areas being application signing and entitlements; increased restrictions in SIP; restricting access to key locations; and interprocess communication.  

And I am sure there are changes in the kernel, but I am confident that Apple will never release details of that.  Perhaps look to Jonathan Levin if he gets to a 2nd release of Volume III of his internals books [http://newosxbook.com/index.php](http://newosxbook.com/index.php) as well as what he puts in his almost finished 2nd release of Volume II.

Personally, I see some of the restrictions as being of greater nuisance than security enhancement.

Most of the obvious published material is directed at developers - e.g from WWDC 2018 [https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/702/](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/702/) or look in the Apple developer documentation.

minethulhu,"The fact that you have:

2 devices that both behave odd when using the bad USB port

these same devices work fine when using the good USB port

Since I assume both use the same software driver (although I don't know this for a fact, I just assume it is true), then this is really does suggest a hardware issue with the USB port itself.

I would suggest a few things:

Make a backup of all your important data.  Not only is this a good idea in general, it is possible that this hardware issue could have impacted your external drive in some way that eventually leads to catastrophic lose (or it could be fine with only the access impact you've previously noted).  Use the 3-2-1 rule if possible, 3 copies of important data on 2 different types of media and at least 1 of which is offsite.  One of the many online backup companies or even iCloud satisfies both the 2 types of media and 1 offsite rule.

Don't use the USB port to read / write data.  As per above, who knows what it might be doing silently to the data.  It may just be going  offline periodically as you've described.  If so, it likely only impacts the file(s) being written at that time.  But it could also be doing something worse, like silent data corruption.  Good news is that most modern filesystems have some built-in protection to prevent these types of things, but I'd rather remove variables that could affect data.

Consider making an appointment with Apple to have them look at it.  If you are in driving distance of an Apple Store, the initial diagnostic is at least free (but does take some of your time).  They likely can give you a ball park price for repair.  You can then decide how much you need that port.

An unmaintained computer program will inevitably stop working sooner or later.

In the off chance that the data is in fact stored in a SQL database, there's a very good chance you'll be able to find a recovery method online---possibly even something that will output everything in plain text, and maybe even something that's open-source and free-of-charge.

Pro_Ana_Online,"Well, you could get an external USB drive and boot up using shift-command-option-r to boot into Recovery Mode w/ going back to your original (or oldest) OS compatible with your hardware. At minimum, it would be something pre-Mojave, and install that OS on the external drive. And you could use that in order to utilize your older version of FMP.

If that's fine, then great. If you wanted to take it a step further you could then download the trial of Parallels onto that external-boot older-OS drive, and should be able to have Parallels install a new VM using that older OS's recovery partition.

You could then reboot onto Mojave/internal drive, install Parallels there, and copy the VM from the external drive onto your Mojave/internal drive.

If you don't want to buy Parallels or don't have enough RAM to really support it you could also partition your drive, shift-command-option-r boot into recovery, and install the older OS onto the 2nd partition and have both the older OS and Mojave on the same system, each with their own recovery partition.

If anyone thinks you can't do this, you can. My 2011 iMac has every OS, and each respective's recovery partition, from from Mountain Lion through High Sierra (6 boot partitions + 6 recovery partitions).

Solution #1: Delete the Bluetooth.plist file.

More often, the reason why Magic Mouse 2 is not working properly is an invalid Bluetooth.plist file. To fix that, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Finder** and open **Go** menu.
2. Select **Go to Folder.**
3. In the text field, enter**“/Library/Preferences”.**
4. Click **Go.**
5. Find the **apple.Bluetooth.plist** file.
6. Click on that file and transfer it to your Desktop. You can use the **CMD + C** command to copy the file and the **CMD + OPT + V** to paste the file into its new location. Alternatively, you can simply delete the file by pressing the **CMD** button on your keyboard and then clicking on the file. Next, select **Move to Trash.** To be safe, it’s idea to back up the file first.
7. Finally, restart your Mac.

After you restart your Mac, your system will recreate the file you have moved or deleted. Magic Mouse 2 should work properly now, but if it doesn’t then try the next solution.

Floop1977,"I have a similar issue.

My original symptom was that after copying a bunch of files to a separate volume via Finder, I noticed that the ""file completion wheels"" for each document had not completed to a full 360° in the destination folder, even though the Finder Copy window had completed and self-closed. Opening a few of these movie files showed the copy had not succeeded because the movies were corrupt and would not play after about 15% of their running time. 

Frustratingly, the source documents seemed to exhibit the same problem, which led me to suspect there was some file corruption on the source disk and now the destination disk.

I tried running First Aid from within Disk Utility and the details tab showed:

`Checking the fsroot tree.`  
`error: bin: invalid btn_btree.bt_key_count (expected 6170336, actual 6170398)`  
`fsroot tree is invalid.`  
`The volume /dev/rdisk1s1 could not be verified completely.`  
`File system check exit code is 0.`  
`Restoring the original state found as mounted.`  
`Operation successful.`

Clearly the operation to provide First Aid and fix the issue was NOT successful, because it said the fsroot tree was invalid, and that it could not be verified completely, and that the original state was restored. So it is frustrating that Disk Utility reports ""Operation successful"" when the First Aid hasn't been applied to fix the problem.

I tried rebooting into the Recovery Partition to run First Aid from within Disk Utility - the exact same problem was located, but again not fixed.

I tried rebooting into Safe Mode (holding Shift at startup) to run First Aid from within Disk Utility - the exact same problem was located, but again not fixed.

I finally tried rebooting into Single User Mode (holding Command-S at startup) and at the command prompt I used

`/sbin/fsck -fy`

to run a File System Consistency Check and force repairs. The system reported ""option f is not implemented, ignoring"" but the process then said ""Performing deferred repairs"" and concluded with ""The volume appears to be OK"".

After reboot I ran First Aid from within Disk Utility and now I get:

`Checking the fsroot tree.`  
`Verifying allocated space.`  
`Performing deferred repairs.`  
`The volume /dev/rdisk1s1 appears to be OK.`  
`File system check exit code is 0.`  
`Restoring the original state found as mounted.`  
`Operation successful.`

So I'm not sure if I fixed the problem, because it keeps saying ""Performing deferred repairs"" no matter how many times I run First Aid. But at least it isn't telling me anything is invalid any more. Cold comfort.

Any and all advice appreciated. I'm running 10.4.1 on MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) with a 512GB SSD.

arob216,"From the Dropbox link below:

### Is this a Dropbox dialog box?

No. This is an Apple system dialog box, not a dialog from Dropbox. This is a dialog box that macOS uses to change your permission settings.

More on this:

In Unix terms, Administrator accounts on a Mac are allowed to use sudo commands to gain root privileges for system-wide tasks. When Dropbox is installing, it uses scripts that run commands to set permissions, copy things to protected areas, etc. These require the Admin account and password to execute, but the password is not stored anywhere by the application In other words, the installer runs a command the OS recognizes as needing Admin to authorize, so the OS prompts for the input. Since Apple runs the dialog in a separate process, it uses sandboxing techniques to protect the input. This method has been used in all OS X versions, and though i sparingly used Macs before OS X, probably back in those older versions as well.

If you come from the Windoze world, this is like UAC. Or put more accurately, UAC took this from the Unix world when they added it to Vista and Server 2008 OS and later.

Surprisingly, Apple has done little to expand this. To contrast, if you install an app that wants access to Calendar, you get a proper that says X Application wants to access your calendar, do you want to grant it? But when these under the hood things are done by installers, it just pops up a generic authentication dialog without a description of what is being granted. Maybe in a future release?",1542431516.0

Pro_Ana_Online,"So your Snow Leopard originally came from a previous Mac w/ your ProTools+plugins (or whatever you have) via Migration Assistant, and continued to work without any need to re-license it?

And they continued to work after after you upgraded your Snow Leopard install to El Capitan?

Have you checked to make sure your exact version of ProTools (or whatever) works with anything newer the El Capitan?

Ballpark figure: how much would your ProTools (or whatever) w/ all your needed plugins cost to replace? (for example, the average cost for say... a student who got that for free in musical school and finds themselves needing to replace it all would be in the $750-$1500 range).

And as of right now, I'm assuming you don't have a Time Machine backup of that Snow-Leopard-Now-El-Capitan partition with your music tools?

And your main motivation is to gain an additional 80gb of space while not having to purchase say... an additional external drive and strongly wanting to avoid wiping out your current external 1TB drive if possible?

What's the most full the original 80 gb El Capitan was? Was it previously mostly filled up? Or was it pretty much empty and barely ever used this whole time?

If you hold down Option during boot, do you have one recovery boot partition, or two?

Have you attempted to see if booting into your original El Capitan normally allows diskutil to size that partition down from there? I'm not saying do this yet (or to confirm it), just asking if you have tried this?

Is it cost-prohibitive for you to purchase an additional 1TB external USB drive?

How much free space do you have on the external 1TB, what's the most it's ever been filled (if greater than the current amount) and what partitioning scheme is it formatted as?

You are minimizing your window, then trying to get back to it through the dock icon. That won't work.

In macOS, clicking the dock icon will either launch a new window, or will return you to the most recently used *non-minimized* window. It *will not* un-minimize a window!

I would suggest that you don't minimize a window unless you really need to for some reason. Just switch to Chrome or whatever other app you need without minimizing. If you really need that window out of your way, press CMD + H to hide it. Then it will disappear, and clicking on the dock icon *will* bring it back.

Windows do behave differently on a Mac. It's not any better or worse, it's just different, and it does take some time to get used to it.

1. Actually minimise the windows you aren't using, with command-m. Then alt-tab between apps (which ideally only have one window open)

DrJupeman,"The Mac does do some things differently and even as a Mac user since 1985, I have found that managing multiple emails can be easier in the PC world simply because each mail appears as an application when you alt-tab.  Let me try to offer a few  suggestions:

Command-tab is the Alt-Tab equivalent of the Windows world.  Use this to quickly switch between applications.  The ""front"" open email will be the one that pops up when you scroll through apps this way and select Mail (I assume Outlook will be the same).

Learn to love Mission Control and Spaces.  Your Mac may have a function key that activates this, but as has been mentioned, you can also very quickly access it through three fingered gestures.  Mission Control very quickly shows you all your open windows (and each of those pesky open emails) and lets you quickly select what you want.  Organizing spaces also helps keeps things neat.

I have not used a Windows OS actively in a few years, but the big difference used to be that Windows runs each document in kind of its own instance and Macs put documents under one instance of the application.  Technically I may not be describing this correctly, but it is one learning difference between the two.  You'll note the application menu is always at the top of the screen on a Mac, not tied to the window of the document you're in that you can resize, minimize, etc.

vmware_yyc,"I got back into using a Mac a few months ago after a fairly long hiatus. A couple things I'd suggest:

- Use Hot corners, and dedicate one for expose. This is actually something I wished Windows had. I find it incredibly convenient to mouse into a corner and quickly see (and be able to select) all your windows. Turn trackpad/mouse speed up a bit from default, and this quickly turns into a very fast/efficient way of app switching.

- Get a tool that can bring Windows' 'snap' functionality into MacOS (Magnet, or any number of others). This is something I live by in windows (since introduction in 7) and was actually surprised MacOS doesn't have any native implementation of this *at all*.

- Learn the hotkeys for stuff. Same goes with Windows. Command ` will switch between app windows.

- Take advantage of trackpad gestures

- Take advantage of MacOS' (excellent) ability to customize commands, gestures, etc.

- Take advantage of Finder. I use Windows search (and run) to launch my apps 90% of the time. Command+Space is basically the equivalent for me of Windows+R or using windows search.

It will take a bit of time to adjust, but after a bit of time and customization, you'll find yourself equally quick on a mac. Watching me on a PC vs. Mac is like watching a skier vs. a snowboarder - same basic thing but different nuances on each platform.",1542219465.0

sinembarg0,"macOS window management is so so so much better than windows.

There are lots and lots of options.

first is the normal app switcher, cmd + tab. it will switch between apps, but not windows within the app. cmd + ` (backtick, same key as ~) will cycle through windows within your current app.

then there's exposé. there should be a button that looks like 3 rectangles in the touch bar (or on an F key). press that, and all windows will shrink and you can see the contents and switch to the correct one. there is also app-only expose, which will do expose, but only for windows in the current app.

beyond that, there are spaces, which are kind of like extra monitors that you can't see all the time, but can switch to. you can move windows to other spaces as well.

and of course, there's the dock. you can minimize individual windows, and they show up in the dock. but you can also hide entire apps (cmd + h), which will kind of minimize everything to the dock icon, and now show any windows for the app (though they're still open).

I'd suggest getting an app like magnet (on the app store), which gives you the windows style window snapping (like left half and right half of the screen). this is the only thing I prefer about the windows display manager.",1542218454.0
sprgsmnt,"As a long time user of OS X, I can tell you that i almost never minimise, but I switch (Cmd-TAB) to the application I need.

",1542219509.0
chrisbenson,"Macs are awesome for multi-tasking, just takes some getting used to. There are different approaches to it. Possibly the easiest would be control-clicking or two-finger clicking on the image, click ""copy image,"" then paste it into your email. 

You can also go to finder, grab the file you want to attach, then Command-Tab to the email program, but in your case it sounds like the compose window often ends up behind the inbox, so the other methods below should work if this doesn't.

You can also arrange the finder window to one side of the screen and your email to the other and drag the file from finder to the email. There are 3rd party window snapping tools that make this super fast and easy with shortcut keys, so you can go from viewing two apps side-by-side to maximizing the email again in just a split second with a combination of shortcuts rather than moving and resizing windows around with your mouse. [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com) is a good free app for that. [Magnet](http://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) is another popular one that also allows you to drag the window to the side of the screen with your mouse, very similarly to how window snapping in Windows works. 

You can also do it using expose and hot corners. If you go to System Preferences > Mission Control, and click the ""Hot Corners"" button on the bottom left, you can configure actions when your mouse pointer hits the corners of the screen. I like to configure ""Mission Control"" for the bottom-left corner, and ""Desktop"" for the top-right corner. That way I can Command-Tab to Finder, grab the file I want to attach to the email, drag it to the bottom-left corner to reveal all my windows, then drag the file over to the compose email window and wait a beat for that window to come to the foreground, then drop the file into the email.

I hope that helps and I hope it's not too confusing. Once you get the hang of Mac OS, it becomes very simple, fast, and second nature. I have a hard time multi-tasking in Windows because I'm not used to it.

Edit: If your email compose window really minimizes when you open Chrome, that is not normal behavior on Mac OS. Microsoft must have gone out of their way to make Outlook behave strangely like that. Normally in Mac OS, when you switch to another app, the other windows stay where they are, just behind the top window, not minimized into the dock. ",1542217331.0

digital_steel,One more thing I would add as general advice to make the switch easier: don’t think of the Dock in MacOs as the taskbar in Windows. The Dock is only meant to launch applications - and subsequently switch between apps that are already running. But to have an overview of several open windows under one and the same application the Dock is not the right tool. Mission control is way more intuitive than a taskbar once you get the hang of it. ,1542221267.0
nerpTV,"This is the one thing that I try to explain to Mac users regularly but it's hard to really describe how cumbersome MacOS window management can be in certain workflows. I use Macs and PCs daily at home and work (I'm platform agnostic and really like both and own waaaay too many computers) and the only real advice I can give you is to learn to use mission control. Some keyboard shortcuts also are useful depending on what's open and you can flip back and forth. But Mission Control is my solution because I can swipe up or hit the function key and then just select what I want open.

&#x200B;

In Windows, you can build a nice grid of apps and programs and they can float around and spawn new windows in the general workspace and it's super easy to keep things tidy and arranged without one stealing focus from the other. On a Mac, apps tend to take ownership of the entire screen space and take a posture that whatever else is running has to creep up through the cracks. But it's like having clear string curtains and you inevitably run into overlap or things buried. It seems most MacOS apps evolved over the years to not exist in a whitespace block, but to let elements float about in individual boxes. I visualize Windows being a sheet of paper with little blocks whereas MacOS is nothing but various-sized and cut sheets of paper that you can layer.

I've been using both for enough time that I just habitually use one differently than the other. When I use MacOS, I appreciate certain things that I don't get on Windows and vice versa. In particular, I like how quickly and easily I can toss application and content windows around and not worry about anything interfering with the way I've laid my workspace out.

Macs work really well if you're working on specific tasks and you are willing to switch between certain workspaces. It's really conducive for productivity especially for content creation, but it's less than ideal if you're doing more monitoring of multiple feeds or currying data across applications. What I'm saying is a little abstract and there are exceptions in all cases, but in general, my view is that MacOS is best exploited with gestures and thinking in terms of distinct workspaces for each app and Windows is significantly better at simultaneous same-screen work.",1542221731.0
wetfish-db,"Clicking the doc icon just opens/activates the program, not the window.   It's not the best way to task switch really IMHO.

I tend to use expose/mission control mostly to switch around.  It's gesture based; on mine set so that if I swipe up on the trackpad with three fingers then all windows on all apps show, and if I swipe down on the trackpad with three fingers then all windows of the current app show.  It's just a swipe and then click on the window I want which is quicker than pretty much any other method I've used on Windows or Mac.

There are also things like Hyperswitch which can help bridge some of the gap when using cmd+tab to switch between windows that gives thumbnails etc.  It works the same way as alt+tab does on Windows.

Many people take to the desktop metaphor readily, as it relates real-world items to the objects on the computer screen and eases the process of getting used to handling these things.  The problem here is with some folks taking things a little **too** literally, and believing they have to dig through layers to get at what's underneath.

I tell people to try **not** to think about getting AWAY from the app you're looking at, and just try to get directly **to** the app you want.  So, if you were looking at an email, and then switched to a Word doc that overlapped the email, **don't** waste time moving the Word doc out of the way to get back to the email window, instead click directly on the email, and of course, it will jump in front of the Word doc window.  Get into the habit of positioning windows so the corners are available to click on, and that way you're always only one click away from getting directly to the particular app window you want.  These habits, combined with liberal use of command-tab for application switching, and command-tilde for window switching **within** applications, and soon you'll be bouncing around from app to app to app like a pro!",1542224462.0

Great advice!

To this, I’ll add: make use of Spaces. One of the best windows management tool macOS offers.

You can create as many Spaces as you’d like, ask an app to be always opened in a specific space or manually manage everything.

command-tilde

command-shift-tilde

These will switch between apps, and between windows within an app.  The last one goes backwards.  The windows of an app stack up as you use them, but as you command-tilde through the stack, they don't get pulled to the top unless you engage them (and two-finger scrolling doesn't count).  So sometimes it's much more efficient to go backwards to the bottom rather than the top.  Awkward to explain but I hope you will understand eventually.

A related keystroke is for moving through tabs: command-shift-bracket.  And in a browser, command-bracket also serves as 'back/forward' navigation.

And speaking of browsers, I strongly recommend command-L for jumping to the address bar, and command-N for windows, which are under-appreciated now that people are so used to tabs!

For example some say open Mission Control (showing all windows) with a key, others will say with a trackpad gesture, both work. But there is also a third option, to configure a corner of the screen that will activate it when you put the cursor in that corner (Hot Corners).

behindtheword,"Given Apple has removed the ability for users to write reviews from the App Store for all new OS releases (probably due to the piss poor ratings the last several releases have had for the first full year after release), I would say no, just on that alone.  Clearly they have no faith in their own product, or they know it's poorly designed and will cause massive issues in performance, potential loss of data/files/folders, moving of folders and files, poor synchronization with older hardware, nonsensical security updates that are sluggish and pointless (not all...some are necessary), and seem more built around monitoring than maintaining.  


Then again the iPhone design aesthetic is dumbed down and designed to break, Macbook Air is trash and is designed to fail under almost any circumstance, and even the Pro's are fragile (used to be sturdy) and still poorly ventilated.  Price has also gone way up for vast reduction in hardware jumps, especially compared to the general market.  


Apple is now charging over $500 for a 10\~20 repair.  They're refusing to repair simple fixes, or intentionally damaging machines in their ""repair"" process of just diagnostics, so you will likely be forced to shell out another 1\~2000 for a general usage machine.  Cable arrangement and screen design is to wear and tear far faster than all other competitors.  


So based on general Apple performance, corporate behaviour, and an unwillingness to trust the public to give fair reviews in the aggregate, as is normally the case, which is to THEIR benefit as a company as it forces them, or should force them to live up to expectations.  Now it's just paid for professional and unpaid professional reviews (most of which are paid on the 1st to 5th pages of searching), which are meaningless as they're a spotlight at a particular point in time and do not reflect updates and changes, nor are they valid as they're generally sent along with pre-built machines, or purchased in machines designed and integrated for said hardware, rarely based on an actual upgrade (which user reviews almost always are)...I would say wait a bit or call and complain or check back in another two months after some necessary App store updates to software and more significantly the OS.  


I'm really hoping Apple steps up the to plate and backtracks on their current course, as if they don't, I can see this company eventually losing their diehard fans, and being forced into markets with far less flexibility.  I used to love Apple products.  I have a hard time justifying them now. 

  
I was going to ask if there is a place with user reviews as one person in my family is in the same boat as you and asking me to find out if it's worthwhile as her last OS update destroyed her previous computer by deleting core files and causing black screens, eventually leading to rebuilding and full loss of all data, but it seems like this is about it, that and smaller forums that no longer appear on the first 10 pages of a Google search.

Secondly, you should be using DP, not HDMI, even if the manufacturer says otherwise. Macs have an issue with HDMI, and can either push lower resolution or lower refresh rate, whereas via DP it works well.

Third, install SwitchResX which enables hidpi scaling on external monitors, and many different resolutions not offered by MacOS natively, and see if that does it.

DylanB00,"From my experience with Hackintosh, using a USB Wifi dongle probably won't work out of the box. The issue is that your computer has to interface with it - without a driver you cannot interact with it at all. I wouldn't personally suggest using a dongle for the reason being that macOS doesn't natively support them, so drivers have to do a \*workaround\* to route the dongle's internet through Ethernet. They are very finicky, mine seems to disconnect very often after putting my machine to sleep, and it doesn't ever let me reconnect without a full reboot. If you're building a rig rather than a laptop, look for a more desirable option, such as a PCI adapter. This [one](https://www.amazon.com/OSXWiFi-Hackintosh-Continuity-BCM94360CD-Bluetooth/dp/B012LOT512/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1542048967&sr=8-1&keywords=hackintosh), has both Bluetooth and WiFi. Using this, macOS will believe this is the proprietary adapter included inside your machine (a \*genuine\* Macintosh), and you won't have to worry about any random disconnection issues. Keep in mind: When you are connected through Ethernet on a Hackintosh, most of the time, iMessage and all of Apple's macOS specific software that links to iCloud probably won't work without a few hacks within your file system. Using the PCI adapter works out of the box and generally enables iMessage and all of Apple's services, such as Handoff and AirDrop (if that is important to you).

>**Corruption detection and correction**. In Btrfs, checksums are verified each time a data block is read from disk. If the file system detects a checksum mismatch while reading a block, it first tries to obtain (or create) a good copy of this block from another device—if mirroring or RAID techniques are in use. If a good copy is found, it is returned instead and the bad block is corrected. This self-healing mechanism does not appear to introduce significant overhead, and it provides a huge benefit: File systems always are consistent. Administrators are notified of repair events, and checksum failures are logged to the syslog facility.

Essentially put in the top level folder, let it ‘read into folders’ and then have it find files with certain extensions and move them wherever.

Edit: I have a minute, so I will try to add to this.

The main backup folder needs to be added to hazel.  Put the folder on hold (so you can play with it before it goes live.  I would suggest also making a copy of it to play with without fear)

Then, you add rules to that folder.  One of them is called ‘read into folders’. That needs to be the top rule always.  Next rule is to match files that have extension of (example) .jpg.  Then the action is to move to a folder (pick one, make one, whatever).  And then another rule for PDF to go into a different folder, etc.

When done making the folders, there is an eyeball icon to ‘preview’ the matches.  Allows you to see what is going to happen before it happens.  You can decide to run the folder (even if its on hold), or just take it off hold and wait a bit.  Done.

w-jn,"i updated from sierra to mojave, and yesterday after around three weeks, switched back to sierra.

mojave is great. the update actually made my 15’ mid-2015 mbp way smoother as far as general ui, more so than ever. the metal 2 gpu optimization was a game changer. currently, i run my laptop on an external ultrawide display. i’m not sure if it’s the uncommon aspect ratio or just overall poor gpu optimization in the os, but my laptop has a bunch of graphics and ui issues running sierra. there’s often really weird flickering when navigating mission control or using a hot corner to quickly view the desktop, and the machine can’t run the quartz composer screensaver ‘arabesque’ to save its life. the screensaver will run at maybe a frame every six seconds. literally.

on sierra. 

but on mojave, i can run that same screensaver on that same laptop out to that same external ultrawide at 75hz refresh rate (via thunderbolt 2 to displayport), thanks to metal 2. never before had i seen that screensaver (or any, for that matter) run so smoothly on my machine, going all the way back to el capitan.

now, to why i downgraded – software compatibility.

i use ableton live, and still have several active projects in live 9, which is officially not supported on mojave. ableton’s support resources even list 10.13 as the last version of macos that supports 9, so i’m sure many other software developers are doing the same. it’s best to check compatibility with your commonly used software before anything. 

live 10 is not yet fully compatible either, but will be. both are fully supported by high sierra, but 10.13 seems too problematic to be worth it. perhaps when i’m comfortable going back to mojave, i’ll dual boot 10.13 for live 9. this is likely impossible to do with sierra (couldn’t find any info on it through a couple of internet searches), being that the fundamental file system changed to apfs from hfs+ as of high sierra.

i cannot comment on differences in battery life, as i usually use my laptop in a desktop fashion, connected to power.

tl;dr if you don’t use specialized software, the upgrade may well breathe new life into your machine; if you do, check compatibility before updating. mojave’s features, optimization, and user experience are leaps and bounds beyond sierra’s in many ways, and will only get better.

/dev/disk0 (internal):

FWIW, I'm still using Snow Leopard *right* now and have run into zero issues. I use Dan Pollock's hosts file in the system and it is doubly enforced by uBlock Origin with the same updated hosts file in the browser add-on and an old AppleScript with the updated malwarebytes list edited in.. and when it gives me grief I blow it out. (haven't had to in *years*)

If you're using modern OSes, stick with the updates for the security.. once your OS gets older and public usage of it falls away, you become a smaller target, and I have actually installed (by accident) really crap programs that were chock full of nagware that failed to do anything other than throw up a blank window on my desktop.

arob216,"It is the device plugged into the power supply that controls what is drawn from the circuit. Almost every power supply is designed to provide more than the amount of power that will be drawn from it. 

The 90W adapter simply implies it can provide up to 90W of power to connected devices. 

Think of your home. You have 120V\\15Amp circuits for most of the wall plugs, higher voltage and amps on circuits for appliances. But, you plug in a 100W light to the 120V\\15A circuit. Watts = Voltage (V) \* Current (A or Amps). So your circuit can provide up to 1800 watts, but the light draws 100.

The key is, the adapter needs to supply the right Voltage for the connected devices. Most USB adapters can adjust the voltage based on the connected device requirements. To illustrate, the USB-C adapter for my MacBook Pro is 61 watts. It lists output as 20.4V\\3A or 9V\\3A for USB-C PD capable devices, and 5.2V\\2.4A for standard USB (USB 1-3 type devices). That means the adapter can be used to power the Mac (20.4V\\3A = 61.2 watts), or an iPad Pro with USB-C PD (9V\\3A or 27 Watts), or an iOS USB device (5.2V\\2.4A or 12.48 Watts). 

A laptop power supply that doesn't support USB-C connectors obviously won't work for smartphones, the connectors won't work. But, a USB-C adapter for laptop can work with smartphones because there are plenty of USB-C cables, including USB-C to lightning, USB-C to USB, etc. The USB-C standard allows up to 100 watts of power, and supports USB PD and USB device standards of power negotiation. Each USB device (phone, etc) has the smarts to communicate to the host power supply what it needs.",1541182671.0

Thankfully, in my case, I had another machine with which to create USB installation media for Mojave. Backed up my Users folder, then removed and reinitialized the primary partition using Recovery Tools (see important note below).

This is indeed the nuclear option, but I've seen several threads about this between Reddit, MacRumors, and Apple Discussions, and there seems to be no other possible option at the current moment; something about the upgrade process totally borks the environment.

**TAKE NOTE**: If you intend to do this and have an MB(P) with a T2 chip, make sure to allow for external boot media within the Recovery Tools environment (Tools -> Startup Security) _**BEFORE**_ nuking your partition!

1. Powered off MacBook

4. It showed the disk and it stated it was 10.14.1, selected it and then hit restart
5. After it restarted it then stated about 15 minutes remaining.

supersailorguy,"Apple doesn't want your average Joe/Jen to be digging in those files, but if you know what you're doing you can freely navigate using the terminal, `ls -a` will list all files including hidden ones (but you probably already knew that). Some directories are hard to get to from finder, but if you can get to them through the terminal you can run `open .` to see the directory on finder and edit files through the graphic interface. In the finder settings you can make your disk visible in the sidebar (or in the desktop if that's your thing) and navigate freely through the graphic interface as well. As to create files, I don't think there's a way to do that from Finder. ",1540929636.0
ianpaschal,"For all of these you can use the terminal which is just your unix/bash terminal you know and love.

However:

1. To see hidden files, use the shortcut CMD+Shift+. They will still appear ""faded"" but... yeah... that's the point about hidden files.
2. To freely explore the hard drive? I'm not sure what you mean (I mean you can go in the terminal, `cd /` and `ls -a`) but you can also turn on ""Macintosh HD"" in the Finder preferences as an item to appear on the sidebar. That's essentially like viewing C:// on windows. From there you can see the system library which contains most app data, system apps, all user folders, etc.
3. This is true. You cannot do this from the finder but I think this is good. Creating empty files is really a power user feature and should be done via the Terminal.",1540931332.0
un_predictable,"You could make an automator workflow to add a blank file to the current folder you are in. You could either launch this with a key command, as an application icon in the finder toolbar, or from the services menu option.

If you go the application launcher in the toolsbar route, make a personalized low profile icon! It’ll look better.

The key command could technically be launched anywhere in the OS if you want it to be. You could take it a step further and run an apple script to check if finder is open or not and open it if you run the script from elsewhere.",1540958410.0
DarthTechious,"I don’t know about alternatives to Finder, but it does allow for quite a bit if you adjust the Finder preferences. (Press Command-Comma or click on Finder near the top left to access preferences.)

If you know the path of a file/directory, press Command-Shift-G to go to it. (To view the root directory, enter a forward slash (/) in the prompt.)

Some areas of the system are protected by System Integrity Protection: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204899 This protection can be disabled, but it’s best to leave it enabled. If you’re looking to create a file, TextEdit is a simple text editor that supports rich and plain text files (.rtf and .txt). Or, you could use the mkfile command in Terminal.

You could use automator to create an app that opens pages then runs a custom applescript -
See https://imgur.com/a/kZ3qwwx

This would run for 20 seconds, checking if you clicked through the new document window after its been opened

here is the code:

	on run {input, parameters}
	set theApp to ""Pages""
	set appHeight to 1080
	set appWidth to 1920
	
	tell application theApp
		activate
		repeat 20 times
			if exists (the first window) then
				set the bounds of the first window to {0, 0, appWidth, appHeight}
			end if
			delay 1
		end repeat
	end tell
	return input
	end run

After you get this in automator and create the workflow just go to File -> convert to and convert it to an app. Then you can launch the new app (that runs pages and the script)

unsafeword,"Using a relatively recent version of Parallels (last few years) you should be able to:

* put the SSD in a USB enclosure

* create a Windows VM without installing Windows

* configure Parallels to associate that USB device with the VM instead of the Mac

* configure a Parallels VM's boot order to boot from USB before hard drive

IIRC Parallels won't be happy without a virtual disk associated with the VM, so you might need to keep a little 1 GB partition around.

Caveats:

* You might also need to boot Windows 7 in recovery mode in order to make it happy with the changed hardware configuration. Windows 10 would handle it a bit more gracefully than Windows 7 would. In a pinch, you can get a recovery disk ISO and mount that as a virtual CD-ROM, and change the boot order to boot from that image the first time.

* This will make some changes to the Windows 7 setup that might mean you have to go through recovery mode again if you intend to use it with the laptop again.

* Windows 7 might decide you need to re-validate your license, or it might not honor it at all.

1) Work with your technology support services to ensure that whatever solution you go with will integrate with their identity management and security posture.

2) Go with the newest/fastest processor available, and max out the RAM on the device.

3) You should select a device that includes some solid state caching to speed up transfers.

aterix2413,"I've had my 2017 Macbook Pro for about a year and a half and and am pretty disappointed with its reliability. Now biggest problem now is that the rightmost 1 cm of the touch bar does not come on. I know this is a hardware issue because it is broken in both MacOS and Windows Bootcamp. I have not really seen this any other forum online. 

Also, when the touch bar is off/asleep, the same area would flicker. It seems like a lot of people have this problem, but I have not seen any solutions online other than 'take it to a repair shop'. I have taken it two two local repair shops and neither of them know what to do or have seen this issue. Apple want the replace the entire bottom half, but I can definitely not afford that.

Poodly_Doodly,"I like most of the stock apps, the only ones I don’t use at all are Calendar and Reminders.

Safari is fantastic, I like that it’s privacy focused and I like the ability to handoff from device to device.

Mail is good enough. I like the features that [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com) and [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com) provide, but I feel better keeping my email accounts as private as possible.

Notes is good, it does everything I want and more.

Maps is great, actually.

Calendar is OK, but [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) is just so much better, and it’s a one-time buyout (no subscription BS). I use it on all my devices.

Reminders is OK, but it looks hella ugly. I much prefer the features available in [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/), which is also a one-time buyout. I have a much easier time managing my to-dos and other lists when I can easily drag and drop entire sections, plan when I’m going to do things, and use tags. Plus the macOS keyboard shortcuts are super useful. [Sorted^3](https://staysorted.com) is a good alternative for iOS, but there is no Mac app yet.

I love Photos + iCloud Photo Library, and I have no desire to switch to Adobe. I generally do basic iPhone edits in [Darkroom](http://darkroom.co), basic macOS edits in [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/), and everything else on [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/), which can be a full Photoshop replacement for both Mac and iPad. It’s still missing certain features and integrations but it’s been a good enough replacement for me.

Camera on iOS is my go-to, but when I have time I will often use [Halide](https://halide.cam) instead.

Voice Memos is simple, but great.

Stocks is pretty decent.

I use [Calcbot](https://tapbots.com/calcbot/) instead of Calculator, but I’ve heard [PCalc](https://www.pcalc.com) is the best there is.

Books is fantastic with the new redesign. [Marvin](http://appstafarian.com) is really good too if you want an alternative, though.

The Home app is good enough for me. The third party options seem good but I just don’t think I personally need any of the features they offer.

iCloud Keychain is fine, but I like [1Password](https://1password.com) much better. There are other good password managers that are one-time buyouts if you refuse to pay a subscription, but personally I find 1P’s features too useful to pass up on.",1540142264.0
trikuxabi,"Safari is the best browser on macOS, period.

The rest of apps aren’t the best, but they are good enough for me. Pages, Keynote, Numbers, Notes, Photos, iTunes, Maps... they all work properly and sync amazingly with other devices, so I’ve found no reason to switch to other apps.

Oh, and I freaking love Final Cut Pro X, not a stock app, but definitely my favourite video editing software.",1540142515.0
-sup3rnova-,"I've been using Safari for the last 2 weeks since I got back on iPhones and it definitely isn't the best browser for MacOS. If you're concerned with privacy, then maybe, but it renders so many pages incorrectly (even the big ones such as Facebook and WhatsApp web), it's considerably slower, and there's a lot of stuttering and lag in general. I tried with uBlock off, on, uninstalled Chrome and helper apps entirely, it still is way behind, which is funny because they are both webkit. The only thing where Safari excels is resource management, as Chrome tends to eat battery percentages and RAM by the minute. For those wondering, there's also handoff with Chrome on iOS devices - you can open tabs across all your devices where you're signed in. 

Mail app is good for users with one (personal) e-mail account, but if you live in your inbox, it's just laughable. I've been testing Spark and Outlook on iOS and I still have to decide on the best one. 

MS Office was a hot mess previously on Mac, but since 2016 (or even the version before) it's very stable and well optimized, and beats iWork in just about everything. Keynote is visually more attractive, but if you have to collaborate on a project with someone who works on PowerPoint, you'll run into compatibility issues and lose more than you've potentially gained. 

FCPX is an absolute beast since the 10, and it competes very well with Premiere in terms of functionality, but absolutely blows it out of the water when it comes to speed and optimization and I wholeheartedly suggest everyone to give it a try. 

I don't use Photos but Lightroom so can't say anything about that. For basic editing and tagging, I guess it's ok. 

Camera on iOS is great, but Halide is better when you have the time to really dive into your shot. 

Calendar on iOS is a joke, I have yet to find a better one. The one on Mac is okay. Fantastical is like Calendar on steroids, it's good for people who plan everything down each step they take on their commute, but for general purpose, I think it's an overkill. I have yet to find something more convenient for my use case. Right now I am using the ones built into Spark and Outlook, neither is perfect but Spark one is much better. Don't use notes but Google Keep as it's accessible from wherever I am via web interface (when my phone dies and I need a pin of a credit card I rarely use for example), which makes it that much more convenient.",1540152406.0

Only downside is that it will occupy one of your already limited ports (adapters are a no-go, from what people are saying). Traveling, you'd be limited to your power cable and the Luna unless you have a portable dock.

I was using Duet before. Somehow, even in spite of how many CPU cycles it consumes, it's still garbage in comparison - and that's when I could actually get it to work.

So to answer the question: Yes! Luna is way more expensive (not even close), but for the hassle-free experience and fantastic performance, it could be your grail.

Update: misread that you tried that. I don’t know what else you want. To me the hotkey profile is the same as yakuake and you can make it even the only profile.

To answer your question I’d say no there is simply no demand. Consider that yakuake is a kde project and outside of kde only little people do use yakuake or thelikes. Some use gnome ports but most people either don’t use a terminal at all or use a terminal properly (ie fullscreen). I prefer to write Alfred workflows or do similar stuff instead of doing quick tasks with a drop down terminal. As common as it might seem to you Dropdown terminals are far away from being highly demanded and since iterm does a pretty good job with it, I doubt it will change so soon.

That being said you could look for the numerous electron terminals. One of them might has this feature. Yes I dared to recommend an electron terminal. After all you want a Dropdown terminal 8-)",1540037514.0

My network is great - measured using iPerf from my MacBook to another iPerf server, no latency or dropouts. Tested both WiFi and Ethernet, while the stuttering was occurring in Airplay I was still getting great network performance.

My main problem is when I'm using my Macbook. I basically on a daily basis present a lot , and travel all over this planet for this.

Sometimes I leave my adapter in my hotel room or don't bother to plug in the power connector... And that was all possible on High Sierra. Was able to present, using powerpoint, a whole day with a real need to charge.

Since Mojave.. when I'm presenting..

a) the macbook becomes freaking hot

Though Activity Monitor doesn't show the actually logic behind this (normal memory usage, normal CPU usage, but high energy)

&#x200B;

b) is drained from 100% to 0% in less then 4 hours.

c) starts to behave weird, by not showing everything on my laptop in presentation mode, though the slides on the screen show all the details, text or diagrams do not show up on my screen.

arob216,"SSH client should be enabled by default, if you are having troubles connecting to hosts, check the hosts for SSHD running.

Apple deprecated some weaker ciphers in Sierra (actually, Apple updated the SSH stack to include a newer version of SSH that deprecated some weaker algorithms). I started getting a response from certain hosts about not supporting certain algorithms and had to add a line into my \~/.ssh/config file for those hosts but it can also be done in the command. For example, if the host uses 3des-cbc, use:

ssh user@host -c 3des-cbc 

or in the config file, 

Host myserver 	

Hostname mydomain.com 	

User myusername 	

Ciphers 3des-cbc

When it fails to connect, the offered cipher(s) that are mismatched will be displayed. In general, you don't want to make these global (in the same file but specified under Host \*) as they are weaker algorithms. But, if it is for a known host that you trust, it might be acceptable. Ideally, the ssh stack on the remote hosts would be strengthened but that is often not possible without updating the OS on the host. For many ""appliances"" like routers and switches, the vendor must update the firmware package in order to update SSH.

tekrevue,"You can easily move only your Photos and iTunes libraries.

##iTunes

Here's the relevant [Apple Support Article](https://support.apple.com/sl-si/HT201625).

Basic steps are to first use the **Consolidate Files** function on your old Mac to make sure that all of the source files are stored together within the iTunes Media folder. Then makes sure both your old and new Mac are running the same version of iTunes (preferably the latest version). Then copy the entire iTunes directory from your old Mac to the new one via any method (external hard drive, network transfer, etc.). Make sure the iTunes app is not running on the new Mac and then paste your iTunes directory directly over the existing blank one on the new Mac, telling Finder to overwrite any necessary files. Finally, launch iTunes on the new Mac and it will detect your copied iTunes library file, see the source media, and open up just like it did on your old Mac, with ratings, playlists, etc. all intact.

##Photos

[Apple Support Article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201517)

With Photos, everything is stored in your \*.photoslibrary file. Again, make sure you're running the same version of Photos on both Macs, then copy that \*.photoslibrary file to your new Mac. Then launch Photos on the new Mac while holding down the **Option** key on your keyboard, which will display the *Choose Library* dialog.

jmnugent,"The problem with this kind of question.. is that you CANNOT just assume that AntiVirus is a simple ""set it and forget it"" sort of thing.. that's going to protect you 100% from every possible threat. 

The modern threat landscape is very complex and diverse:

* It could be a simple Virus/Trojan

* It could be a silent ""drive-by"" Web installer (that doesn't need Admin-rights) .. like a Chrome Plugin or other type of Browser plugin. 

* It could be some sort of Extortion scheme or identity-theft scheme/popup

* it could be an attack that leverages a 0-day exploit or some sort of crypto-locker Encryption-extortion. 

Anti-Virus should never be your only layer of protection. Never. If you want to stay protected on the Internet,. you need to have multiple layers of protection,.. such as:

* Have Backups

* Keep everything updated (OS, Browsers, Applications, Plugins,.. everything) 

* Follow manufacturers recommendation of how to configure your system for maximum security (Firewall, Full Disk Encryption, Don't install Apps outside the App Store,etc,etc) 

* Your normal User account shouldn't be a Local Admin

* Don't do risky/dumb shit. (no risky surfing, don't open unknown emails, don't click on stupid popups. ,etc) 

If you religiously follow that kind of stuff.. your need to run Anti-Virus is reduced by quite a bit. ",1539446372.0
Consibl,"It depends who will be using it.

If you know know how to safely use a computer (and are just worried about stuff sneaking in) then don’t install antivirus it will just slow things down with no benefit.

I suspect many of the widespread issues and non-issue oddities (such as this one) in their OS and product releases would have been discovered and fixed much earlier if their beta testers were comprised of more people who were not Apple fanboys.

Charge gate is a classic example, I immediately discovered the issue within a few hours of getting my Xs Max and reported it as it was obviously an issue that needed to be fixed.  Apple fanyboys, on the other hand, shrug their shoulders and say ""just wake your phone before plugging it in, what's the big deal"" not even willing to acknowledge it's an issue worthy of reporting.",1539275089.0

fatt_maddison,"""looks like 1440p"" does not look blurry on my 27"" 4K monitor. It's too small for my taste-- I've gotten used to the default ""looks like 1080p"" option. I like having everything nice and big and easy to read.

But that's a matter of preference. I definitely would not say the 1440p option looks blurry at all.

I have a Dell P2715Q.",1539261671.0
lethalwire,"> But now the thing is should I save some money and go with 1440p or cash out 4k. I know the differences, scaling, HiDPI mode scaling, etc etc, I googled all of that. But what I need to hear is how's the situation with 1440p 27"" screens on Mojave? 

I think there are a few answers to your questions, but in short:
If you have the money and are a stickler about the fonts and don't want to wait for updates, go with 4k. 

Here is my reasoning: 

I'm a bit of a stickler, and I am having a difficult time getting used to the font rendering. There are a lot of folks out there who claim that adjusting those graphic settings fix the problem, but IMO it only helps. 

I have a 2015 MBP with 2 secondary monitors. 
At work I use 2 27"" Dell U2715H - 1440p IPS 60hz. I use these monitors 5 days a week from 8-5pm. Some programs seems to have updated/patched and there is no longer an issue with the fonts. For example, iTerm2 had an issue with the font rendering, but in a recent update they've fixed it (not sure how).  On the other hand, I use Microsoft Outlook for email and the fonts look bad most of the time... not sure if that will ever get patched or not. Also, I've noticed that thin fonts (E.g. Raleway/Monsterrat font) look kind of bad on Google Chrome. It's even worse when those fonts are italicized. Maybe there will be a fix? There's also an issue in certain areas of Mojave as well. For instance, in the task menu bar my time/date and username look horrendous when they're not in focus.

My only gripe w/ chrome is the 'x' button of each tab being on the right side. This is inconsistent w/ macos design language. All the traffic lights are on the left side in macos and so should the 'x' button.

One thing that I hate is their keyboard and magic mouse.  My fingers just can't do touch typing as well as on a pc keyboard.  I suspect it is because of the profile of the 'flat' keyboard.  For the mouse, I'm used to laying my hand on the mouse but the Apple mouse is touch sensitive and I haven't been able to change my habits to adapt to their device.

The learning curve can be a bit steep and the Magic Mouse and keyboard take a bit of getting used to.  Touch typing on the flat Apple keyboard I find difficult as well. Thankfully there are 3rd party alternatives for both if the Apple versions aren’t to your taste.

A “full disk” doesn’t mean what it used too... worth looking into APFS’s snapshot technology (seen in TimeMachine) but at a higher level looking at how the basis of the file system has shifted. [Apple File System Reference](https://developer.apple.com/support/apple-file-system/Apple-File-System-Reference.pdf)

>	An Apple File System partition has a single container, which provides space management and crash protection. A container can contain multiple volumes (also known as file systems), each of which contains a directory structure for files and folders. For example, the figure below shows a storage device that has one Apple File System partition, and it shows the major divisions of the space inside that container.

By design the new APFS will fill physical disks, however “available space” exists not by how many blocks are taken up on a disk , but how much of the allotted “container” or file system is available. 

Because of the copy on write/change, and optimization for SSDs this will allow for more stability in the file system while leading to “always full” disks in the old sense of the term.

While doing basic browsing in Chrome (no video, just browsing text/image based websites) I'm lucky to get 5 hours of battery life from 100% charge. The battery only has 146 cycles on it.

I thought it was due to a python script I had running in the background that prevents my computer from shutting down (it suffers from the shutdown bug when an external display is not connected) and killing that script yielded very minimal improvement.

Browse in icon view is supposed to set the icon view to the child folders when the child folders do not have set icon views. but this option seems to have no effect on the problem or the solution. 

Seems to be a problem of persistence in the finder.plist but unfortunately because Apple overrides any modification, removing the plist no longer works. I google'd and found no working solutions, though, the problem persists through multiple macOS versions prior to Mojave.

If not, there’s no possible way to downgrade without losing data.",1538850353.0
IemandZwaaitEnRoept,"I've done this, but I was prepared. I have an external disk with two partitions, one for data, one for an installation of the High Sierra, which should be at least as big as the internal system disk. Of course this external disk should be USB3 for speed, but USB2 will work, just a lot slower. Don't use a USB stick or SD card for this. A HDD disk will work although startup will take a minute or so longer. 

You should find a way to install High Sierra on the external system disk. Don't use your normal username, but use something else like ""admin"". After that it works almost like normal, you can browse the net etc. 

If you have this, you can select the startup disk in system preferences, and boot from the external disk. When running from the external disk, you can copy all your user data to the external disk. I've done this with rsync 

    rsync -axv /Volumes/internalsystemdisk/Users/john /Users/

Because you're going to copy your own folder, you shouldn't be logged in as that user but as ""admin"" or something else, and then rsync all data. Then login to the original account and you have a working system on the external disk. If this system works. you can erase the internal disk and using Superduper you can copy the external disk to the internal one. With superduper you have to be sure it finishes the complete procedure and makes that disk bootable. 

Then keep the external disk until mojave works, then update the external disk with mojave using superduper and keep it updated from time to time. I have three external disks, two for backup, and each has this system disk. 

So basically it's this:

* Take an external USB3 HDD/SDD, but not SD or USB stick
* Create at least two partitions that are big enough for your complete system
* Install High Sierra on this disk with user ""admin"" and update if needed
* Startup via the external disk and login to the admin account
* rsync your original user account from the internal disk to the external one
* login to your account on the external disk
* see if all works, test a day or so
* backup to another disk to be sure
* erase internal disk
* superduper: copy external system to internal disk
* startup to internal disk
* keep the external disk with HS as backup until you're over to Mojave and have that working as it should
* you can use the second partition to install Mojave on, to test in case of conflicts as I've had

Mission Control, for example, will drop into the single-digit frames per second if I have a lot of heavy applications open. Panning between fullscreen Windows isn't nearly as bad, but it's certainly not a totally smooth experience.  Resizing can be extremely laggy in some applications. The new iOS ports (News, Stocks, etc) are so poor in resizing performance that they almost seem broken.

I think the Mission Control and fullscreen panning are due to VRAM being paged out (which happens even on my 8GB GPU).   Resizing is probably more CPU, but I don't think there's a CPU on earth capable of smoothly resizing the News application.

benjackson77,"You're absolutely right. I cannot believe people who say Cover Flow was useless. Cover Flow was the ONLY solution in Finder to view large RAW files (such as 43MB Raw files from Sony A7R cameras). Quick look was slow (2-10 seconds to load), and Gallery View is JUST as slow now in Mojave. I now have NO way of quickly tagging and previewing hundreds of pictures after a photoshoot. I'm really very very annoyed (have sent Apple feedback). Gallery view would be fine if it was as fast but it's just not. It's probably enough for me to downgrade back to High Sierra as it's a HUGE hit to my productivity. One thing is I might check out Path Finder - thanks for that mention, it might save me if it's just as fast.

&#x200B;

For me, I get the change. Cover Flow as a CONCEPT wasn't that great, it was kinda dumb really. But when it was the only way that large files would all load together and you could scroll across and view them all quickly with ZERO load time, it was now I realise, very very smart. I don't need the 'flow' idea, I just need the speed of loading. So again, if Gallery view was just as fast which I assume Apple was going to do, it would have been great as I do like the expanded info pane etc.

&#x200B;

Only other thing I'd mention is that the cover flow idea wasn't terrible in comparison, as I could see 3 photos on screen at once, to easily compare to choose which one you like best (if 3 photos were very similar you could see all three very easily and flip forward and back). Can't do that anymore.

Code000Destruct0,"I have to process and store a ton of mostly product photos (duplicate RAW and JPG versions) that stay in named folders and eventually share that folder with finished/Photoshopped shots and occasional text and PDF's of matching CAD drawings . Cover flow was the fastest, easiest way to have a ""dual view"" which included very long finished filenames, the original RAW and JPGS, along with a variable sized, lightning fast multi-image scrolling view. My workflow depended on Finder's ease of blitzing through any hard-drive, chip or stick and Apple removed that from Mojave. Sorry Apple, Gallery is pretty much useless in those respects. I'll investigate Path Finder or just keep the newly redone Adobe Bridge opened and see if that works any better <sigh...>",1540384294.0

Upgraded from High Sierra to Mojave without a hitch.  Been using Outlook for while (since Snow Leopard?) and decided to dip my toe back into Mail.app and Calendar.app to see what's been going on over there.  Added by 365 account with EWS without a problem and then. things. slowed. down.  My iMac is in an office with a robust Internet connection.  Outlook on the same Mac and Outlook on a PC on the same network are zippy fast.  The download is seemingly going on forever.  It will download 20-50 messages and then stop for more than 5 minutes before grabbing another small chunk.  THe amount of messages to download is rocketing to 40k+ what the server says is in the mailbox and beyond the two ""downloading"" activities then a thrid connecting activity pops up and hangs.

Things I've tried/observed:

* Removing and re-adding the account
* Whacked the entire apple.com.mail folder (after trying some individual files)
* The system log on modern macOS is full of a lot of cruft and not very helpful but it does look like it is spending a lot of time on TLS and potential DNS erorrs.  Any URL referenced in the error, however, resolves just fine from the command line so this could be one of those ""normal errors"" that so often fill system.log

I entered recovery, mistakenly formatted the entire disk to AFPS +Encrypted (including recovery partition) and now I have to do an internet recovery with a super slow internet connection. Lol. 

In retrospect, I should have made a recovery USB first and maybe just disabled file vault for a while and let it be slow for a couple of days.  Maybe you just need to give it a little more time?",1538619924.0

It will run Windows 10, as it meets all of the requirements. However, it may be sluggish on graphics intensive applications, as it uses the Nvidia GeForce 9400M. 

El Cap is a wonderful OS, and newer ""features"" are actually enabled by hardware, rather than software. AirPlay, etc all use an onboard, custom video codec chip.

It does not support 5 Ghz AC wireless networking or 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet.

But El Capitan on your Mac Mini is quite a good end of support for the device. Most applications still support El Cap.

Don't try to be current with hardware. Take it to the absolute farthest Apple will support it, and then find a nice use case for it. 

Otherwise, you can take it to Apple to be recycled and they may give you a credit on a new one.",1538595112.0

As of the need to access your contacts, someone already replied. But my guess is that this also includes some cache-cleaning process, though I'm not entirely sure.

The good thing is that you can go directly to your system preferences in the privacy section to be sure not even your native apps are using more personal data than you'd like to give.

The only thing that bothers me is that in order to erase cookies from Safari you now need to enter your password. I emailed the company asking about this change, and their response was that in order to keep the cleaning process going now that the file system has changed (as well as the new privacy settings) you'll always have to go through this ""firewall-like"" process. Which is a good thing. They don't store in any way your password.

> Focus-follows-mouse is not a particularly suitable input method for OS X because its menu bar was designed to be at the top of the screen. When you move the mouse out of your application window to get to the menus, if it crosses any other application's windows on the way, the menu changes.

In that thread, there are some recommended terminal commands to enable `FocusFollowsMouse`, but I just tested all of them in Mojave (10.14) and they do not work. If you want to try them for yourself, you will need to run `killall Finder` and/or `killall Dock` and/or `killall SystemUIServer` afterward to restart those services for the settings to take effect.

There are apps that will do what you want, but it seems they all require you to disable [SIP](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899), which I personally am not a big fan of. Short of that, I don't have an answer to your question. Wish I could be of more help.

On windows stealing focus, this doesn't really happen on macOS in general, mostly depends on the program. I can only recall one program doing this kind of stuff with me (JDownloader).

On files/processes, macOS does what you tell it to do. Hell, you can even rename files *while* they're open and you're using them, the OS doesn't throw a fit. The search in macOS is just plain awesome, i'm still amazed how easily it is to find files/folders.

On folders, my Downloads folder has over 3000 items in it of all filetypes. I don't recall every getting frustrating navigating it, even with my old Macbook Air.

Sounds, the error sound ""Sosumi"" can be a little jarring, I like it though. Easy fix. One thing in the latest macOS is that the screen flashes white on errors but that's easily disabled.

Level of user tweaking: macOS is pretty straightforward and needs minimal tweaking, though I like tweaking/customizing where I can.

Microsoft and Cortana. I just installed High Sierra on a recent build, even to my surprise Siri was off by default, kudos Apple. Only time you'll get nagged is if you use Apple's services and they prompt for a sign-in (iTunes, iCloud, etc). After I installed High Sierra, I only got one notification to ""take a tour"" of the OS, dismissed it, haven't seen it since. Literally the only thing I suggest you do to your Mac out of the box is to enable the firewall.

Updates. Super lax on macOS tbh. My old 2013 Macbook Air (which I use everyday) is still running El Capitan. But security updates and the like are easily put off on the notification itself or disabled entirely in settings and the OS respects that. I can't recall macOS ever forcing an install, maybe once to patch a zero-day or something a long time ago.

MacOS is gorgeous, a joy to use. And the new dark mode in Mojave isn't merely an inversion of colors. It's truly polished and refined.

On high res monitors, I can't really speak to this. BUT there have been some quirks regarding multiple monitors that apparently persist to this day. Might want to google it.

But with all that said, MacOS isn't infallible. I'm sure every mac owner has experienced random bugs, big and small or just plain bad components in the machine itself. For me, a few years ago there was a period of months where for some unbeknown reason my computer would lock up completely. That was apparently fixed after an update and hasn't happened since.",1538245613.0
trisul-108,"My experience moving to MacOS was very positive. My experience with Microsoft software is that it is ""feature list"" driven, whereas MacOS is design driven .. design in the broadest sense of the word. I found Microsoft annoying because there were many ways to do things, but only one way really worked consistently, and being a savvy user meant being taught these little tricks ... how to do and how not to do. 

MacOS was more intuitive for me, things worked as I would expect them, and advanced features where hidden behind a facade, so you only deal with what you use all the time. In other words, less clutter.

I really like what you said about ""something you like using"". I get this on the Mac, down to feeling good about writing a document in Pages or a presentation in Keynote, and this motivates me to do my work better. This is not about functionality, but more about the aesthetics ... like working in a nice office, with light and plants, as opposed to being in a dump. Some techie people do not value this very much, what is important to them is that the chair and table are adjustable, that the monitor is large enough etc. They don't even notice the environment. Those would be the Linux users.

However, there is problem with this rosy view:

1. Apple greatly admires Microsoft (and vice-versa) so that MacOS is slowly losing its intuitiveness and becoming more feature-list driven.
2. People who learned the tricks with Microsoft now find that they do not work, and their intuition seems impaired ... I've seem some of them feeling frustrated when switching to MacOS.",1538243137.0

gorbash212,"macos is odd, because i was a computer geek also when i started using mac. You'll find that macos has its own fleet of things just like that to annoy the crap out you.

- When you press return on a file, it renames it.
- To achieve what you want, its actually some weird command shortcut called cmd+o.
- Try to delete a file next :P
- Its mindbogglingly frustrating to do so many things that used to be in a rightclick menu until you learn the keyboard shortcut.
- You need to know keyboard shortcuts or the os is is frustrating and impossible.
- Windows is windows, macs always were closer to appliances. In the past, they literally offered less configuration and diversity because it was assumed that the configuration you got was the 'best'. This ironically made the os harder to use. In windows, there's a really complicated dialog somewhere. In mac, you have the gui, or you're straight to the command prompt. There's no windows middle ground of complicated gui, it was extremely dumb combined with hardcore. Having said, this has changed over time, and osx is about as convoluted as windows these days, or is getting there.

So you have to learn how to use it, and if you measure it up to what you know, there will be some laughable moments. Having said:

- You don't have to deal with satan. You know this true, because apple bill you up front. They aren't ""free"" updates. Look at the price delta between a mac and a rationally chosen windows competitor. Also apple use the yearly updates to implement their planned obsolesce strategies like they do on ios. The scary thing is.. so do many paid app vendors now. Be warned. And to their credit, they have never made a mac slower, they simply refuse to install the new version, and its 6 (new versions)+2(security updates for past versions) years i think.
- You won't be short of any program you have on windows. The mac eco system has been great since a time that's faded out of memory. There was a time when there was literally no alternative to many things on mac.
- At least the taskbar can autohide now. Though i don't use it the animation is too slow.

nerpTV,"There are pros and cons and quirks with both. MacOS is much less heavy on the updates and the experience is more ""pure"" in the sense that it doesn't have the feeling of stuff being rammed down your throat. 

I use both extensively and my preference for each tends to waver. I absolutely hate dealing with network shares on Macs and performing what essentially are IT functions on my home network (and it's a pretty extensive network) are faster and easier on Windows. When it's time for me to organize tons and tons of photos, or shuffle encodes around and tidy up my Plex server folders,  I'm using one of my Windows machines. 

But for day-to-day use, browsing, writing, consuming media and regular stuff, I really enjoy using my Macs. My best monitor is shared between my beefy self-built gaming PC and a 2014 Mac mini. Generally, I'm using the mini and when it's time to game, I switch the monitor to the PC's DisplayPort input and I'm off to the races. When I'm not in my lair, say upstairs to cook dinner and hang with my wife and kids, it's a tossup between my MacBook or my ThinkPad. If I have to do a lot of writing, you can imagine I prefer the ThinkPad. Other stuff, MacBook. 

When I think about Windows, I also think about Windows Server since I've run some variant of it for many years to maintain a massive local storage repository. Currently running Server 2016 and it handles file storage, Plex, Minecraft, DNS, VPN, remote access to all my machines and I've been playing around with HyperV. Server 2016 is LTSB so it's pure windows in the sense that it's bare, no consumer gunk, no forced updates or reboots, etc. Between MacOS and Windows, there's no comparison when it comes to Windows Server, obviously.

So I like both and much of it has to do with the hardware as much as the software. Windows is just so much stronger when you're in a corporate-style environment with a domain and want to enforce GPOs, user accounts and network access and update deployment. IN fact, I could start using WSUS and control and push updates to my client machines through the server and eliminate some of the automated Windows Updates. GPOs are powerful. But for the person with a single computer, or a desktop and a laptop, me pontificating on the power of corporate windows networks with dedicated servers is not helpful, so don't think I'm saying everyone should build a ridiculous homelab like me.

I say welcome a Mac to your world and appreciate it. As far as Windows, my suspicion is that some of these annoyances will be addressed over the next 12 to 24 months as Microsoft has lowered Windows as a priority on the corporate totem pole. You can fine-tune the update situation a little more now and reduce the interruption a bit and hopefully they improve that. I also think that they need to make the Home edition no more naggy than Professional. Some of the over-the-top stuff was pushed to Home editions and not Pro, and Pro is still naggy. 

It hasn't helped that Microsoft has been pushing numerous cumulative updates in recent months and apparently abandoned the sole ""Patch Tuesday"" concept to speed up deployment. They've indicated that they intend to cut back on the frequency of major updates and the twice-yearly major feature update cycle will soon be more of a tick-tock thing with a major update in the spring and a fine-tuning and optimization update in the fall. Corporations would move up LTSB builds in the fall and skip spring builds. ",1538254294.0

I was Windows all my life, several years ago bought an iPhone and an iPad, and grew increasingly more interested in macOS. What I did was set up a VM in VMWare to learn the OS. The experience is mostly complete out of the box. I thought macOS was a walled garden with few settings like iOS but it wasn't. There's plenty of options and ""alt/option key-hidden"" functionality to discover.

For me, macOS greately benefits from these third-party apps:   
\- BetterTouchTool (powerful touchpad/Magic Mouse gesture maker, keyboard shortcut maker, TouchBar customizer AND Windows-style snap tool \[BetterTouchTool includes BetterSnapTool functionality\])  
\- Bartender 3 (this app neatly organizes the menu bar in the top right as there's no native arrow menu there)  
\- Alfred (enhances the system-wide Spotlight Search with workflow scripts in the paid version, but the free also brings substantial improvements - the results appear literally immediately as you type with no delay, and the result won't change if you wait too long which happens with Spotlight results sometimes - annoying).

MichaelEvancoe,"1. On macOS, you don't have to wait for new devices to ""install"" when you plug them in.  Only for very special devices like certain audio interfaces.  I find that quite nice.
2. Resolution scaling on macOS is perfect, literally.
3. iCloud integration is so good, far beyond anything microsoft offers.
4. Registry, group policy etc, doesn't really exist on macOS.  You may need to dig into the macOS filesystem if you're doing development stuff, but you NEVER have to mess with this stuff for normal tasks.
5. No annoying sounds and notifications.
6. No forced installs of stupid children's games from third party devs, no Onedrive notifs constantly, etc.  macOS is Vanilla af
7. There are no random errors.  You will only see random errors from poorly coded third party programs.
8. Never experienced an application steal focus.
9. Updates, you do have to restart for them to install a lot of the time (system updates), but you're given the option to delay them.  And there is a preference option to only download the updates, not auto install.  You can then choose to update when it's convenient for you, and don't have to wait for the download to complete because it's already been downloaded in the background.

souvlaki_,"The criticisms you provided are practically non-existant in macOS. Although i usually have to wait for Downloads folder to load, probably because it's still uses an HDD - probably fusion - instead of an SSD. It's a work iMac so i can't change it. However there are other annoyances for me, main in window (heh) management:

- You cannot alt-tab between windows of the same application. If you want this feature you must download a 3rd party tool.
- You cannot close individual windows of an application from the dock. Nope. Even when you have minimized a window and it appears as thumbnail in the right part of it, the only option is to open it. You can only quit a whole application. If you want this feature you need to pay for a 3rd party tool.
- You can't cycle windows with the dock button, you need to right click the icon and select it from a list (no thumbnail previews, just a list with the window names). You can replace this functionality with a 3rd party tool.
- You can't drag and a window to the screen edge and have it resize, for that you'll need to download a 3rd party tool.
- Can't close a window from desktop overview.
- This is minor but some apps (looking at chrome) don't like maximizing and instead only stretch vertically when you try to maximize to the whole screen. Not really apple's fault by why is this even a thing? You need to use a keyboard modifier to get functionality you'd expect.
- If you have multiple screens you cannot have the dock to appear at both at the same time. This is bit of annoying for me because the dock takes a noticeable amount of time to appear.
- In windows you can press start+1/start+2/etc to open the application pinned in the taskbar at that position. In mac you need yet another 3rd party tool for this.
- Minor preference for me but there is no Intellihide for the dock, only autohide.",1538298086.0
Andy900,"I switched from Windows to Mac in 2011 and I can't believe I didn't make the switch earlier. Everything feels so much smoother and and more thought through in Mac OS. It generally just works and is at least as powerful as Windows in every way (apart from gaming, but I'm an adult so I don't care). No more annoyances, crashes, freezes or blue screens for me.",1538346798.0
satysin,"I switched from Windows to macOS in July when the new MacBook Pros came out. It took me a good month to fully adjust as while things look the same on the surface with windows you move around, etc. that is not how things really are. The truth is macOS does things quite differently. 

The reason for my switch was that I was fed up with Windows 10 *and* fed up with so many shitty so called ""Premium"" laptops. I had the Surface Book 2, Dell XPS 15 (9570), Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon and Razer Blade (15"") and I returned them *all* because they all had issues that a £2000-3000 laptop should **not** have. I won't go into the issues now but if you (or anyone else) wants to know I am happy to share.

So to answer your questions -

1. This is still possible but I find it happens far less often than it did on Windows. I don’t know why. Perhaps developers are just a bit better about it. Who knows. 

2. This still happens on macOS but again far less often. Basically only when you shutdown with a blocking file open or if you try and eject a drive with a file open. This is good though if I am honest. Would you rather be prompted to save or just have it trash your unsaved work??

3. I quite like Finder. I know many don’t but it works well imho. Never had an issue with thousands of files. Then again I never had an issue on Windows either

4. You can turn this off. But you can turn it off in Windows as well. 

5. I see almost zero error messages on Mac. 

6. Well macOS doesn’t have a registry so no worries there. Apps have something called a plist but you don’t have to mess about with them. Maybe delete the app data folder if you want to reset the app but that’s about it. 

7. There is Siri which Apple prompt you to setup but if you don’t want to use it you can easily disable it and it goes away. Nothing like on Windows where Cortana is almost impossible to fully disable. 

8. There are updates to macOS obviously but they are not as often as Windows. However a macOS update can take quite a bit longer than on Windows which is pretty damn quick these days (kinda has to be with how many updates Microsoft seem to put out!)

9. Mojave is is really, really nice imho. It has a high level of polish not seen in Windows since perhaps the XP days when they put a lot of work into changing the whole look and feel of the OS. 

10. macOS is pretty much perfect for HiDPI screens. Actually it is more the normal DPI screens that have issues now so anything lower res can look kinda shitty, just something to be aware of if you are using a 1080p screen or lower. 

Overall I am really happy on macOS. You have an iPhone and iPad so you will also benefit from all the integration features like Handoff and Continuity which work amazingly well. For example I am writing this reply in Pages. I didn’t save the document just closed my laptop and then carried on writing on my phone while I was waiting for my son to get out of school and now I am finishing it off back on my laptop. No saving, no manual syncing, etc. It just works. So good. 

Same with Messages (even SMS messages), FaceTime, contact and email syncing, etc. It all just works so well. I like to keep a daily journal for which I use an app called Day One and it all just works between my laptop and phone. One feature I really like for when I am on the go is the automatic personal hotspot with my phone. There is nothing to configure and I don’t need to keep hotspot enabled all the time but with iCloud my MacBook Pro can use my phone and setup a hotspot instantly. It has never failed me. So damn good. I know it is a small thing but man it is so nice to have it just work without having to get my phone out and enable hotspot. I really love it. 

Anyway if you have any specific questions just ask. I will hopefully be able to answer and if not I can probably find out for you with a little time. I really can’t emphasise how happy I am since switching. I used to feel like I was fighting with my computer to get things done. Yes Windows has the benefit of more hardware options and some software as well as usually being cheaper but with that comes a load of other problems and I just had enough of it all. Really my only complaint is that it did cost me a bit more to go with a MacBook Pro and iPhone over a Windows laptop. However even a similarly priced Surface Book 2 was no way near as good as this MacBook Pro so I considering the little bit extra I had to pay was well worth it for a platform that does “just work”. Of course I know I am in a privileged position to be able to buy such expensive devices and it is not something everyone can afford to do. However if you *can* afford to do it I feel it is really worth it.

The wallpaper changes when I disconnect the dock/monitor, but that’s because i set the monitor as  the main desktop - when the monitor disappears, the main desktop moves back to the laptop, so the wallpaper does too, which is fair enough; when i reconnect, everything goes back as it was.

Are you attaching the dock always to the same MBP port? In the past, when I didn’t use a dock, switching port was occasionally seen by osx as getting a different monitor.

&#x200B;

**Bluetooth Devices Not Connecting to Your Mac**There was a Bluetooth issue during the beta phase of macOS Mojave development, but it was believed to have been fixed in the release version of Mojave. Even so, some users are reporting that many third-party [Bluetooth devices](https://eshop.macsales.com/search/?q=bluetooth) are unable to connect to their Macs, or aren’t seen by their Macs.

This is an easy one to fix, and only requires the removal of the Bluetooth plist file your Mac maintains. Speculating on the issue, I believe the plist file was damaged during the upgrade process, or when it was first accessed during the setup process.

The fix will remove the file, along with all the data about the Bluetooth devices you had connected to your Mac. Once removed, your Mac will generate a new default Bluetooth plist file to take the place of the damaged one. This will fix the basic problem but will require you to go through the connection process for any Bluetooth device you wish to use.

&#x200B;

**(Use the Finder to delete the Bluetooth.plist file if you are having issues connecting your Bluetooth devices.)**

To delete the Bluetooth plist file, follow these steps:

1. Open a Finder window, and browse to /Library/Preferences.
2. Locate the file named: com.apple.Bluetooth.plist.
3. Select the com.apple.Bluetooth.plist file and drag it to the trash.
4. Empty the trash.

The com.apple.Bluetooth.plist file will be recreated.

Go ahead and try using or connecting a Bluetooth device.

Reptkeu,"I recently bought a 2018 MacBook Pro and the bluetooth works very badly.

The third-party wireless keyboard and mouse that worked perfectly on my 2012 MacBook Pro work very erratically on my new Mac.

The keyboard misses 1 out of 20-30 key strokes right after startup, then misses as high as 1 out of 5 keystrokes after 20 minutes use.

The mouse misses many clicks too - about one out of 5 after 20 minutes use.

When I use ""Send files to device"" or ""Browse files on device"" commands, the transfer speed usually gets down to 1kbps, and sometimes maxes out at 15kbps.

I have tried reinstalling OSX, resetting the Bluetooth module, deleting the Bluetooth preferences, resetting the PRAM and PRAM/NVRAM. The problem is still there.

The keyboard on the Mac works normally, appart from the logging screen, where it misses keystrokes too. The track pad seems to work normally, appart from logging screen where it sometimes moves slowly.

The third-party wireless mouse and keyboard both work perfectly on other computers.

I have tried disabling Wifi and the mouse and keyboard seem to work a little better, but file transfer is still 1kbps. Could it be that there is an issue with radio interferences from wifi?",1540376737.0

I can't imagine Apple not testing this machine rather thoroughly, so I tend to think it must be one big issue causing most of the problems, rather than a host of issues.

&#x200B;

So far:

* I lost all of my printers and scanners, and cannot install new ones
* doing things like loading a new file in OmniOutliner, Pages, and several other programs takes forever
* connecting to servers on my LAN takes forever, usually failing
* unable to format SD cards, or unmount them

I think something is very badly wrong with diskarbitrationd, which fails several times per second, continuously. The error message is marked ""private"" in the logs so I don't know the issue. My console log is about 99% a stream of blank error messages from it.

&#x200B;

A lot of things like Amazon helper processes were failing, so I removed all of them to cut down on the noise. 

&#x200B;

Because of the storm of diskarbitrationd errors, I have to think that most of my problem is there, just I don't know what or how to work it out right now.

&#x200B;

On a positive note, the stuff that works, is working better. ON1 Photo RAW is faster, as are several other photo and graphics programs, and once I manage to get a file loaded, word processors, text editors, and stuff like outliners works fine. Its just that initial file open that is taking forever.

&#x200B;

Any ideas appreciated.",1538394729.0

franram,"I tried this with the support but in my Mac sometimes display the thumbnail and another sessions not, my system is unstable.

And I can not find the error yet.

I did the next:

0. Check if the thumbnails display in safe mode. In my case in safe mode was ok.

1. Remove those task from launching when you boot up your Mac. you’re going to want to remove all those apps in the list. 

2. reset and do the NVRAM/SMC resets.

3. then test and see if that resolved the issue.

&#x200B;

\# Remove tasks. From laughing: Go to:  > System Preferences > Users & Groups. Select your name on the left, then click on LOGIN ITEMS.  Then deactivate all the apps You’ll want to select each app in that list, then hit REMOVE or the minus sign at the bottom. It just removes those task from launching when you boot up your Mac.

&#x200B;

\#For resetting the NVRAM, we would just want to go through these few steps. 1. Shut down your Mac. 2. Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (⌘), Option, P, and R. You will need to hold these keys down simultaneously in step 4. 3. Turn on the computer. 4. Press and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys before the gray screen appears. 5. Hold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time. 6. Release the keys. Resetting the NVRAM usually resets settings such as Speaker Volume, Screen Resolution, Startup Disk selections, Time Zone information, and a few other settings.

&#x200B;

\#How to reset the SMC on Mac notebooks 1.Shut down your Mac. 2.Using the built-in keyboard, press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the keyboard, then press the power button at the same time. Hold these keys and the power button for 10 seconds. 3.If you have a MacBook Pro with Touch ID, the Touch ID button is also the power button. 4.Release all keys. [5.Press](https://5.Press) the power button again to turn on your Mac.

1. Reboot your Mac and hold Command+R when it boots up  until the Apple logo appears.
2. When the MacOS utilities appear go to Disk Utility then choose your Hard drive (usually it's Macintosh HD) and mount it (there is an option in the menu).
3. Then open Terminal which you can find in the left corner menu and type the following commands:

cd ""/Volumes/(the name of your hard drive)/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/HAL"" and press Enter.

mv \*.plugin .. and press Enter.

If you are confused with where to put spaces:

cd(space)""Volumes/Macintosh(space)HD/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/HAL""

mv(space)\*.plugin(space)..

techtim89,"I too am suffering from the dreaded battery drain.  As soon as I installed Mojave on my 2015 13” MacBook Pro it began.   In addition, my system becomes very hot.  Here’s my scenario; after work I store my laptop in my backpack and take it home.  When I pack it away at 5:30 it appears to be sleeping, no fans or sounds at all and battery is 100%.  3 hours later I take it out of my backpack and it’s so hot!!  Like heating pad hot and the battery has drained to 50%!!  When waking it, it’s incredibly slow and the fans start blazing fast.  After a couple minutes it cools down and the system begins to preform normally again.  This past weekend I upgraded to a 2018 MacBook Pro 13”.  Wouldn’t you know it, same problem with it and Mojave!

I’ve been trying many of the temp fixes I’ve read online with hibernation/standby settings to adjusting Bluetooth settings.  So far haven’t found a consistent fix.  Well today 10.14.1 dropped and I had high hopes only to update and have no change with this issue whatsoever.

I too recall High Sierra having the same issue upon initial release up till 10.13.2 or so.  About 10.13.3 it was perfect!  I’m curious if it’s a user profile issue with the upgrade and user profile migration?  Or just macOS is the issue.  I’ve considered downgrading back to High Sierra but it’s a process of data/profile migration and just time consuming on a brand new 2018 machine that shouldn’t have these issues.  I’m at a crossroads...  ugh...",1540959556.0
techtim89,The frustration continues...  Well the SMC reset did nothing.  This is beyond infuriating!!  Chatted with Apple support again and they setup a Genius appointment to take the device in.  I’m at a loss...,1541256798.0
rindthirty,"Thanks for making this thread - you're not imagining it, Mojave on my 13,1 MBP also is having intermittent battery drain issues while sleeping on battery power with nothing plugged in. Apps generally open are Firefox, Safari and iTerm2 - I've so far tried to narrow it down by not keeping everything open when I sleep it (or minimising the apps with Cmd+m first) but it's proving tricky to troubleshoot.

I *think* the issue is less likely to occur if everything is closed before the lid is closed, so at this stage I might have to try that process of elimination again.

I've also just tried ""sudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 0"" so will see how that goes (for the record, the power settings haven't changed between High Sierra and Mojave).

I'm speculating that this is a new bug related to the ""faster wake from sleep"" feature that Mojave brings (I can confirm that it does wake up more quickly from sleep).

For those who are still on High Sierra: I recommend holding off an upgrade for now - dark mode while decent, is not worth the hassle of this new bug.

EDIT: I just found this which has a few extra commands that are more than the tcpkeepalive one - https://appletoolbox.com/2018/10/how-to-fix-macos-mojave-battery-draining-issue/ - possibly promising if my hypothesis that the faster waking from sleep thing is ruining the battery charge level during sleep is correct...",1541438677.0
techtim89,"Well went to Apple...  Guess what!?  Nothing wrong found.  However the tech said they could keep it overnight and run additional longer tests on the machine.  However regardless I bought the machine from B&H PhotoVideo.com rather than Apple direct due to the delay from Apple on getting the device.  So even if there was a hardware issue they couldn't just swap the system I'd have to go through B&H.  Reached out to B&H and they overnighted me another system.  At first upon migrating my data and apps all seemed great.  Sadly though this evening I kept checking in on my stored system and sure enough at 11:00pm the device was starting to get warm and the battery went from 85% down to 70% in a couple hours of stand by.  So now I think it has to be software related.

Anyone have any ideas on how to best track down the culprit application?  Originally when I had this same problem I was on Mojave.  So when I downgraded back to High Sierra I just moved over my files and reinstalled all my applications.  Thoughts?

Throughout the day when I’d close the lid of my MacBook Pro and then an hour later or so open it it would be fine.  However again this evening I place it into my backpack bring it home.  2+ hours later I take it out and it’s hot again and the battery lost significant charge.

Genius tech advised me to wait for Mojave 10.14.1 or check if they fixed the issues and bugs before updating.  So for all those people with this issue, going back to High Sierra is one option, or wait for the next Mojave update.

UPDATE: 10/30/18:

I can report that all my issues I was having previously has been fixed with Mojave 10.14.1 released today.  I made sure I had a time machine of High Sierra just in case.  No more lag, no more stutter.  Battery drain is also gone.",1537937412.0

\*\*HDCP Errors iTunes\\Safari fix\*\*

Symptoms:

\*You had to reset the PRAM on your Mac for whatever reason

\*iTunes movies won't play. You either get a black playback window or an error related to HDCP.

\*Hulu and Netflix movies won't play within the Safari browser.

\*YouTube is unaffected by this.

\*Hulu and Netflix still play within Chrome web browser.

\*Windows 10 (VM nor Bootcamp) are unaffected by this bug

Fix (workaround):

\*Boot into Recovery Mode on your Mac (command+R)

\*Open terminal and type in the command EXACTLY as written:

nvram 8be4df61-93ca-11d2-aa0d-00e098032b8c:epid\_provisioned=%01%00%00%00

Nothing in Activity Monitor is showing as grabbing the processors, nothing is showing as ""not responding"" except whichever app is beachballing. Thus far I've seen it happen in Safari, Finder, Mail, and Scrivener, which is a writers' word processor.

Also, connections to networked disks have taken a serious shit. Copy ops tend to fail after a few minutes with a (-36) disk error (volume not found); what's actually happened is something on the backend has frozen the system, the comms failed, and the copy op got dumped. The hallmark is ALWAYS a slowdown of network read/write in the thirty seconds or so prior to the copy failing. This happens on both 2.5 and 5 GHz WiFi. No, ethernet is not an option, or I would be using it.

Curiously, I have an early 2014 Air which exhibits exactly none of these symptoms.

fryktelig,"I'm not sure why people are replacing the default apps, they're really good. I was using Alfred before Apple incorporated the behaviour into the OS. Now I'm not sure what it's useful for. You can use the built in app Activity Monitor to keep an eye on system resources. Pages, Keynote and Numbers are really good MS Office replacements. VLC is still good as a media player, IINA annoyingly needs an update every time you open it. If you need to record video of your screen you can use the built in Quick Time Player. Screenshots work out of the box with cmd-shift-3 or 4. If you're into coding, Sublime Text or MS' VS Code. If you don't want to use Safari (which is gonna give you the best battery time, but inferior ad blocking due to uBlock Origin not being fully supported), use Firefox, which has become pretty good again. 

Best app I can recommend is Homebrew. With it you can install shit using Terminal. Syntax is pretty easy. Instead of going to a website to install Firefox, or most apps, you can just do `brew install firefox` in Terminal. It's absolutely worth checking out and getting to know. You might not want to use it to install apps you don't know, but if you did a fresh install at some point, for instance, and know the apps you want, it's way faster and less annoying. 

A couple other good 'general purpose' Terminal apps (or cli apps) I can recommend using are streamlink, youtube-dl and ffmpeg. With streamlink, you easily open streams in a local media player, saving system resources. To use it, type `streamlink twitch.tv/yourstream 720p*`in terminal and you're done. *720p is fine on my non-retina setup, you can do higher if you want. With youtube-dl you can save videos from most websites that play them, just type  `youtube-dl url-to-video` and it'll most likely download it. Ffmpeg is a bit more complicated, but you can use it to quickly compress videos or convert them to gifs, create gifs, and more. ",1537916137.0

Force Touch on a word to learn what it means, find its Wikipedia page, or more.

Otherwise, I agree with /u/nerpTV's advice about not installing a ton of productivity apps right away.

CedricRBR,"It’s a long ways off from being as polished as the light version. 

The separator lines color is inconsistent, the buttons have a weird backlit vibe which i personally don’t like, etc. 

Somehow the light version manages to look clean and crisp with monotone backgrounds, yet I wish dark mode would have a slight tint. 

I wish the font color would not be white but a very light gray but in light mode the black is perfect.

In Finder, list mode is abysmal in dark mode, the alternating line colors have too big of a contrast.

I do like the dark slate background ... brightness though, it’s better than a true black background imo.

Transparency is inconsistent (haven’t checked if light modes changes that, I guess not), why does Photos not have transparency?

The colors of photos or iTunes album artworks or application icons pop much more on a dark background, that’s a plus

Everything was easy to visually understand, there was just enough contrast, buttons were easily identifiable and easily readible, the grey didn't burn my eyes at night.  It was perfect.  Hopefully this flat fad is near an end because I think the failure of contemporary UI design started sucking really hard when that became popular.

* Blender (3D)
* Blackmagic Fusion
* Blackmagic daVinci Resolve
* Affinity Designer
* Affinity Photo
* Affinity Publisher (beta)
* FL Studio
* Logic Pro
* Screenflow (Telestream)
* Scrivener 3

For example apps that had already dark UI like Spotify and Quicktime looked beautiful before. I hope Apple removes the borders or someone finds some kind of hack to do so. Also I'm happy that dark notification center is back, but it's doesn't look  nearly as good as it did on Yosemite and El Capitan. Furthermore, with color accents the contrast should be same that it is when using the grey accent. Now it looks more of a brownish grey when using color accents. And last but not least, the dock! This is not a dark mode issue, but the dark dock hasn't ever been really dark, which has annoyed me ever since Yosemite.

dportalesr,"Indeed.

I've noticed that the split screen feature has been effed up after upgrading to Mojave.

I used to have the problem of the knob/bar getting stuck sporadically before migrating to Mojave, that, as you say, only in external monitors. After the upgrade, it's always like that. Moreover, I've noticed that it's actually due the fact that the knob disappears.

My workaround to make the knob reappear is to **switch the applications in the split screen** (by making the app title bars appear and dragging one of them to the opposite side). Unfortunately, the knob will disappear a few seconds after losing focus, so you'll have to do that everytime you want to resize them.

Annoying AF.

Other issue that came up with the upgrade is that sometimes, that bar appears on other non-split desktops! Of course it's not clickable, more like a redrawing problem, and it disappears when the cursor goes thru it. I hope they get these fixed soon.",1538898479.0

It's almost 2019 and weirdly Apple UI designers team try hard to make macOS seems more old-fashioned like never before. I wonder how much Apple UI designers are tasteless. Really disappointed. I wish I knew what they were thinking when designed that clumsy super XL logon screen. Besides that, they killed off sub-pixel antialiasing in Mojave and call it a “refinement”. Not sure UI team know what that word means..

I've been using UNIX since 1990, started using Linux about the time you were born, and moved to Macs personally in 1999. Professionally I use Windows and Linux pretty much daily at about 70:30 split.

For me, my Mac does everything the other two do with a nicer, more consistent, easier to use interface. I spend quite a lot of time at the command line too - Windows CLI has never got even close to zsh, bash, csh, etc. I can switch between any of them and more at will, on my mac. Virtually all of the Linux tools I use for work will run just fine on my Mac.

The hardware has been consistently amazing to use (I \*really\* miss my trackpad at work!) and reliable - my macs have all lasted 7yrs+, easily (the one I'm replying to this on I bought mid-2010). The kit is more expensive but the software is generally a lot cheaper, and between that and how much longer my macs have lasted, I feel that more than justifies the extra cost.

Now as to your question about the everlasting battle - I've seen countless flamewars over the years easily 99% have been started by Windows fanboys with no real experience in other OSes. They're often abusive, dismissive and insulting .. and then dozens of other fanboys pile in to back them up. Best thing to do is just ignore them tbh.

Was absolutely unable to remove the broken snapshot in question (looks like it was there, but orphaned, so it was counted, but inaccessible). 

So long story short - moved all my data to a different drive, completely repartitioned my system SSD to have just one partition, restored my shit back, reinstalled macOS (because as far as I remember repartitioning removed all the stuff it needed to boot and restore itself) - and voila! No more issues.

**Accepted solution:**

1. Locate the FaceTime plist file within your Library folder at `/Users/<your account>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FaceTime.plist`

Kmetadata,"Have you tried to upgrade? You can just upgrade from your version to the next via an upgrade. The stupid store wants me to install High Sira. Stupid ass cunts don't know how to make a good laptop let alone an upgrade process. You could wait until some one releases a VM of it and then get it for free. You can log into your apple id from the VM and then you get that version of OSX for free. You ask for solutions not about ethics. You could also use a pirated version of OSX from the OSX 86 or other project builds. They al require money though. I got a HS VM, but I do own a Macbook Air 2015 1.

&#x200B;

As for using a VM/pirated version as long as you use it on apple hardware you don't have an issue with the EULA. I don't see any ethical issue as you did pay over 1000+ dollars for hardware that WILL break with in 2 years.  The only thing is why do you want it? HS is the only other version that has APFS support so why upgrade? Is it the stupid Dark Mode or tho bullshit marketing. Also they are killing OpenGL and 32bit support after this version. It makes sence as they will switch fully to ARM by 2021 as they mentioned in there  world wide dev confrinece they  had this year. They don't mention how this will effect ports, flink or homebrew. Gens-gs is 32bit only as is the best for emulation of the 32x.

There will most likly one more release that will support intel just like they did with the switch to intel from power PC.

I personaly would not use it other then for a VM. I am fine on OSX 10.10. I will never call it ""Mac OS"" as Iam not one of these stupid Hipsters that like them because they are cool. I use OSX because I liked how the platform worked compared to Windows. Linux and Haiku are still my personal choice do to all the issues with OSX and hardware, oh and the whole X86 NSA backdoor in every chip since the Pentium 4 on higher end Intel CPU's.

&#x200B;

I  don't care about the new gimics as it is just the same OSX we had since Sira with APFS support. If any thing it will just keep the same old same old. That is apple for you. What would be cool is if the yworked with Valve so we could get those cool steam interactive wallpapers on OSX. Hell it would be nice if Apple would put effert into OSX instead of masterbaiting to Steave Jobs dead body with there iphone crap. Again I like the OS not the shitty community.

I've fixed it! You'll have to edit the dune HEIC picture though. If you're willing, follow these steps:

&#x200B;

1) Go To: /Library/Desktop Pictures/

2) Find the file called ""Mojave.heic""

3) Save a copy as a backup somewhere else

4) Select the picture you want to have instead

5) Edit image values (DPI, size, etc.) to fit

6) Copy the image and paste it in each picture of the heic

Please note: While doing this, Preview may crash/be stuck when you close the file. If you wait, it will terminate and progress will be saved. You need admin privilege to do this.

you are near answer ;) you have to change Mojave.heic but to get it work after reboot you need to trick macOS to load it into recoveryHD because if you have FileVault system will not boot fully until disc is decrypted so it take wallpaper from recovery partition as far as I know. 

How to trick it? Its very easy.

1. Replace Mojave.heic with your image
2. Turn off FileVault and reboot
3. You should now see your wallpaper on login screen
4. Login and turn FileVault on

nimicnicie,"I think it's less ""Will it work?"" and more ""Will the apps/software I use work?"" If Apple guarantees the new OS will work on your model, then it most likely will without much problem. On the other hand, if you use a lot of third party apps/software (professionally or not) to be on the safe side you should contact the developers and ask if their app will work with the new OS or if one should wait for a patch. I have a late 2013 MBP 15"" and I'm not very keen upgrading from High Sierra until I know the software I use will work flawlessly. Personally it's music making apps/DAWs and plugins - Logic X has had some bad bugs in the past when a new OS was released. For others it may be image, video or text editing or gaming clients like Steam. So, depending on your workflow and usage of your MBP, to be on the safe side contact the developers of the software you use the most/depend on and ask how the software performs on your specific hardware with the new OS. So unless I see some benchmark tests that Mojave will speed up my MBP and make the battery last longer I'll probably upgrade to it next year or so when they've ironed out all the bugs.

The 1st time in recovery the re-install aborted with this message:

I checked the log, it showed messages about missing folders and about volumes unexpectedly already being APFS-formatted. I now have come to believe that my 3TB Fusion drive has somehow f\*\*cked up the HFS+ to APFS conversion in the first installation run (the one that I aborted after 20 hours).

MacMerovingian,"Hey Guys...sorry but I'm a 1st time poster but I ran into the same issue...I kept digging for 8 hours till i kept trying and found a fix that may help but its better than wiping the computer. 

The 1st step is the easiest.. if you know someone who has a Mac (running High Sierra or Mojave) and you have a Thunderbolt cable to connect the 2 computers you can shut off your computer, plug the 2 computers into each other via Thunderbolt and restart by your computer by holding the letter T to put your computer in Target disk mode. Once the drive shows up on the desktop (make sure in the menu...Finder, Preferences, General that Hard Disk is checked off so you will see it). Your drive should show up as an orange drive on their desktop. Click anywhere on the desktop and hit the keys Shift+Command+G. You will get a window (go to folder) clear anything in there. Then type in /Volumes/(name of your hard drive that's orange..Macintosh HD..etc)/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/ and hit enter. It should take you to the folder with the diagnostics logs that's causing the crash. Double click the file that reads loginwindow\_2018..Look about  9-10 lines down for the Plugin Path. This is the file that's causing the issue. Go to the same folder that is shows the patch of the file causing the issue and delete the file. In my case it was /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/hear.plugin. I deleted the file and emptied the trash and my computer started and logged in without issue.

2nd method more complicated. ..Sorry I don't Terminal commands that well but here is a start...You need to reboot the computer and hold down the Command and S keys simultaneously until you see white text appear on the screen. Next type clear and all the crazy text will disappear. Then  type cd /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports and hit enter. Then Type ls and you should see a bunch of error logs. That should show you the logs that's causing the crash. For example in my case it was coreaudiod\_2018-09-093601...look for the file loginwindow\_2018-09 (it'll be todays date or something like that with your computer name at the end.crash). Then with that same crazy name in your mind...type this in head -15 (then put that longgggggg name in exactly as you see on the screen loginwindow\_2018-09-25-112004-MAGUM-MACBOOK-PRO.crash) hit enter. This should then give you the first 15 lines of what's causing the computer to not keep you logged in...look for Plugin Path. In my case it was  /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/hear.plugin. 

&#x200B;

Now you need to delete the file that's causing the issue. Now your going to need to find someone here who is good at terminal commands because you have to be careful. But I think you should be able to type in something like this

(in my case I needed to delete the hear.plugin so I typed this in at the root#) 

**rm -Rf /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/Hear.plugin**

High Sierra and Mojave use a file system that is optimized for SSD's (APFS), but that doesn't mean they won't work with normal HDD's.
But yea, I saw the same with my friend's iMac, that everything was just slow without an SSD. I can't really tell if it's because it's the baseline or because they are getting slower as they age or something.

MacOS Mojave was just released today, but I would not recommend installing it until the first patch is released, just to be sure that no first day bugs will mess with your setup.

I hope this answer helps, just go with High Sierra and you should be fine.

Make sure to completely wipe and re-partition the HDD before installing if you want everything to be ""as new"", but really really make sure that you have everything backed up! That is the most important thing before reinstalling!

- Finder windows are sluggish to launch
- 4 crashes in 30 minutes
- Custom icon in the winter don’t get dark treatment

I also find the dark mode super ugly. They added lots of extra jazz to window edges that makes it look very reminiscent of Windows Vista, and also turned the max-min-close buttons dull and pukey colored when they didn't need to be.

Seriously, 4 crashes in 3 minutes. Totally frozen and needing a hard reboot. Do not install this crap software.",1537888153.0

* Minor annoyance, but I’d really like it if screenshots taken with the new screenshot tool added to Photos would show up in the Screenshots smart folder. I mean, why aren’t they?
* There really should be an option to Copy in the share sheet for news. A lot of times I’ll come across an article and I just want to copy a link instead of share via messages or whatever.

2. When the macOS window appears, if you’re not performing a clean installation, skip to step 7.

3. Click on Disk Utilities and choose the Erase tab.

4. Give your disk a name, choose APFS or Mac OS Extended (Journaled), and if Scheme is available, set it to GUID Partition Map.

5. Press Erase.

6. When it’s finished, quit Disk Utility to go back to macOS Utilities.

7. Choose Reinstall macOS.

MacBook Pro (mid 2012 and newer)

MacBook Air (mid 2012 and newer)

MacBook (early 2015 and later)

iMac (late 2012 or newer)

That's just my estimate, upgraded to High Sierra which took me about 45 mins everything altogether, hence my estimate. The max should be 2 hours but I doubt it'd take that long. If you are in a hurry and you really need to use your computer, I'd urge you to only press on 'install' when you're about to go sleep or when you definitely have some time - in case it'd take a bit longer on your machine.

Ironmxn,"This has to be the dumbest oversight on Apple’s end. Maybe they forgot to work in a reset feature to delete all the finger prints and start over after a top case replacement (also, don’t ask me why the BOTTOM of the clamshell is called a TOP case, but it is apparently). Only thing I can personally suggest is a fresh reinstall of the OS. That would probably fix it for sure, but it’s a pain in the behind. Next idea is trying to find the .plist files for Touch ID and deleting them then restarting. Not too familiar with this myself, as I don’t have a 2016/17/18 MacBook with TouchID, but I know that those pesky .plist files can do a lot of help sometimes. This is the extent of my knowledge/experience. I’d try to see if the Apple Support team on twitter can talk to their devs and see if they can come up with a solution. One thing I’ve always hated about Apple is that once you reach a certain level of expertise as a consumer (meaning most of us in this subreddit), the Geniuses aren’t very genius, and I find myself often wishing I could just call the Apple Dev team directly and talk to someone there. I know for a fact their are some software engineers there who could take 20 seconds out of their day and say “Oh yeah I’ve seen this exact problem. No big deal, just do blah blah blah and you’ll be good to go. Best of luck!” And thus, I wish you the best of luck with your ordeal. ",1537746934.0
rsharms929,"Yeah, I looked it up and there were a few articles that appeared which were not present when I initially tried to fix this. All of them said a dev said on reddit to go to recovery mode and use terminal with the command xartutil —erase-all which deletes the Touch ID data from the Secure Enclave which is part of the T chip running the Touch Bar. I tried it, and sadly it didn’t work. I just talked to an Advisor and Senior Advisor, and they said since I tried these steps the next thing to do is go to the store with an appointment. I sadly don’t want them opening up the computer again because I don’t want more issues to occur. ",1537747165.0

Open it up (either using spotlight, which is quicker), or it's in your Applications -> Utilities folder.

Sort the columns by % CPU and it will show you what's eating up most of your resources at the top. It's quite likely you won't recognise the name so just google it exactly as it's spelled with the word 'CPU' or 'activity monitor' following it to bring up questions people have asked about it in the past.

Now that you've narrowed down the culprit, you can contact the developer if it continues to be an issue. If it's something that comes with macOS it might be a natural result of upgrading - say, Spotlight having to sort through lots again in the background after a big update.

Will Mojave make the fonts look worse in my external monitor ?",1537711792.0
rin-Q,"macOS, since the introduction of retina displays, has indeed been pretty bad for font rendering on lower DPI screens. My monitors are 72 DPI and the fonts never look so clear, or at least, reading on those screens running macOS always tires my eyes faster than on the same monitors running on my Windows install. 

But switching to Windows... Will not be the end or your worries. Windows 10, right now, still has a bad time scaling apps between different screens with different DPI/PPI, resulting blurry (like a Photoshop gaussian blur over text) in non-modern apps. And even on a single high-DPI screen, the scaling can get weird, even for, say MS Office 365 apps which end up with huge icons which seem to be scaled way too much proportionally to how the UI labels are. I mean, they're not blurry, so there's that. But it feels so wrong and unbalanced. 

I'm more on the graphic designer side of things, though, and catch little details really easily. Windows 10 has inconsistencies almost everywhere and it drives me crazy. Meanwhile, macOS hates lower DPI screens and the Settings app is a joke. Both OSes are tools with their pros and cons, however. My laptop's a 2017 non-touchbar 13' MBP, and that's because I trust Apple laptop hardware and macOS much more on a day-to-day basis than I do Windows 10, which is what's on my main PC on which I do my graphics design stuff at home.

My eyes are pretty horrid though, and I sit pretty far from the display. I'm not downplaying the issue, I do wonder why they decided to get rid of it. I think the issue will be more prevalent for those on lower PPI screens like the MacBook Air.

neliason,"One important difference is you won’t have the registry. Instead configuration is done through files. 

Learning to use a shell and scripting language can really make life easier for you. There is also AppleScript and Automator for automating tasks.

I’d strongly recommend learning the keyboard shortcuts. Print out a list of them. They are consistent across apps and Apple did a great job of making common tasks something you can do without a mouse.

Also, apps all have great help. Most importantly, if you start typing in help not only will it show you a list of help topics but it will also list menu commands. If you hover on the menu command it will show you where in the menu it is. If you click on it then it will do the action. So for instance if you type ‘bold’ it will show you where in the menu it is and if you click on it then the selected text will be made bold. That short of intuitiveness and completeness is what I think really separates Mac from other OSs.

What happened is that you didn't actually erase the entire drive, because Disk Utility's GUI is dumb. There's also a bug in the macOS installer that's causing the APFS preboot volume error when you reinstall macOS to an APFS volume where you've only quick-erased the system partition (instead of creating a blank APFS container).

Here's how you solve it:

Reboot to Internet Recovery, not the onboard recovery partition. Open Disk Utility, in the View Menu, click on Show All Devices. Click on the Apple SSD drive entry (not the Macintosh HD partition entry), click Erase, repartition it as APFS with GPT / GUID formatting (feel free to name it whatever you want, Macintosh HD is the factory name setting). Then exit Disk Utility, re-run the installer, and things should work.

jdickey,"It's pretty clear that The iPhone Company Inc doesn't give a wooden nickel about Macs anymore or, by extension, the customers who depend on their Macs every day (and who likely bought iPhones and iPads as a result of a positive Mac experience).

I came back to the Mac ten years ago because it promised, and delivered on the promise, that I could be productive as a developer in the same OS I could have usable, compatible, well-supported productivity apps for. Peak Apple for us came during the Snow Leopard era; we had beautiful hardware and software that Just Worked, whether on Macs, iPhones, or on our brand-spanking-new iPads.

Then, anorexia and dementia started setting in. As Macs (desktop and otherwise) became thinner and lighter, the hardware became less reliable. As the displays became ever-brighter and more beautiful, the keyboards increased their exacerbation of RSI.

And the software… With Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion, the only times I ever shut down or restarted my daily-use Macs was when a software update required me to; it was common to go *months* just sleeping rather than shutting down and restarting, with no apparent negative effects. We skipped 10.10 Yosemite because too many of our daily-use tools were unreliable on it; that was *the first time since 10.1 Puma* that we hadn't just immediately upgraded to a new OS immediately and continued working without further delay. By the time we were an El Capitan shop, being able to stay up for two weeks without a restart was unusual; logs say that my 2011 iMac managed that feat four times in the two-and-a-half years I was running 10.11 on it (including once when running a developer beta). We tried upgrading to Sierra a month after it was released; like many others who published their screams of anguish and tales of woe for others to learn from, we moved back to 10.11 once it became clear that several of our daily workflows simply couldn't ""flow"" on 10.12. We tried again later; a total of *five more times*.

I'm typing this on a 2017 iMac running High Sierra. It's been nicely stable so far (just passing 17 days' uptime for the first time as I've typed this). This and the 2012 MacBook Air are the only two of our six Macs now running 10.11 El Capitan or 10.13 High Sierra that we'll be able to update to 10.14 Mojave. Two of the remaining four can, in theory, run High Sierra; we'll be testing that theory in the coming weeks. That leaves two otherwise perfectly-usable Macs running an operating system that will no longer get security updates and thus must be presumed incapable of being fully secured. Prudence thus requires that they be air-gapped from the surviving Macs.

Apple seem more interested in becoming an ""aspirational"" luxury marque than in actually continuing to build great hardware and software for people. Those big companies and high-net-worth individuals for whom Cartier or Bentley pricing is no object may well continue to buy for a time, and Apple may continue to make jaw-dropping revenue numbers and command insane share prices for several quarters to come. But for those of us wearing Timexes or Seikos as we drive our Hondas and Chevys to work, we'll have to find something else to make do with. For us, probably Linux again.

,"I'd say they're both getting worse, however your scaling issue is simply due to a design choice by Apple.


DPI scaling on Windows 10 - as the name would suggest - simply scales UI elements by selected percentage. This is probably the best option for performance, but apps which are not DPI-scaling-aware will look broken). macOS, on the other hand, pixel doubles all UI elements AND renders your entire desktop at a higher resolution, then resolution scales it down to fit your monitor. This places less of the burden on developers to update apps for DPI scaling, but has the downside of the image not looking as sharp when you are downscaling onto a panel with a resolution that does not divide cleanly into the frame buffer size.


So, using your 4K monitor example
e.g Windows 10 = 3840x2160, OS always renders and outputs a 3840x2160 image, selecting 200% UI scale simply doubles of the size of all UI elements.
macOS = 3840x2160 screen, selected ""looks like 1920x1080"". Pixel doubled UI elements and 3840x2160 image is rendered and then fits nicely on your screen. However, ""looks like 2560x1440"" has the OS render pixel doubled UI elements onto a 5120x2880 (2x 2560x1440) frame and then downscales it to 3840x2160. Your loss in sharpness comes from the fact that these resolutions do not divide cleanly, as individual dots may find themselves clipped as they spread over two pixels.",1537166521.0

The operating system knows they are cache files, so if you actually need the room for your actual documents, the operating system will automatically delete old cache files to make room.

If you use a cache cleaner app, you are wasting your time thrice:

* The computer runs slower because the cache files aren't there to make it be fast.
* You are spending time running an app where the goal of the app is to make your computer run slower.

I thought all this was due to the fact that I installed Mojave on top of my High Sierra with all the old clutter, so made a fresh install of Mojave on a clean hard disk. Turns out the freezing is still there.

Sony isn't going to sell PlayStation given how much money it creates for Sony.

&#x200B;

Custom systems are the exact opposite of a game platform, where the advantage is identical hardware that allows for optimizations that aren't possible on a diverse platform like Windows or even macOS.

&#x200B;

ARM chips, even Apple's, are still a long way from being competitive for a PlayStation/Xbox style gaming console.  ARM's clear advantage is on battery power, which is not a constraint for PlayStation/Xbox.  


The running iOS apps on macOS may or may not happen, but it has nothing to do with ARM/Intel.  Unless the developer is doing something strange a simple recompile will be possible given the frameworks will be the same and we don't have the big/little endian problem anymore.

&#x200B;

Apple's rumored interest in moving macOS to ARM is all about battery life and heat given that most PC sales these days are laptops, and again for most macOS developers a move to ARM should be a simple recompile (incidentally this is the same reason Microsoft again pushing ARM based Windows laptops).  While Intel has made great progress over the last 5+ years in reducing the power requirements there is still an ARM advantage and given Intel's current problems there is an opening for either Apple with their own chips, or the Windows ecosystem if Qualcomm or someone else, can deliver ARM chips that offer acceptable performance.

I use both a Dell Inspiron 7577 and the 15"" Macbook Pro, so I even tried using them simultaneously with the Logitech software (but that's one hell of a buggy one to get them both connected/used at the same time...)

If that doesn't work, turn off the mouse and turn it back on < Long press the switch button to start sync and delete the current one. Turn it off/on again and try pairing it to your Mac - this worked well for me and I didn't have any issues ever since.

**If above method doesn't work:** Plug in the Unifying USB into the Mac and use it with that. (If you have enough/free ports, of course)

sfsdfd,"Yes, there's an option to do so - it's called: [Optimize Mac Storage](https://www.imore.com/optimized-storage). iCloud Drive remotely stores all of your data remotely, pares it down as local storage space becomes constrained, and then incrementally pulls it back in as you use it.

It's a neat feature that [nearly everybody keeps turned off](https://9to5mac.com/2016/09/22/macos-sierra-storage-optimization-poll/).

There are a few problems with this concept:

1) It interferes with Time Machine, which obviously has trouble backing up files to a local storage device if they only exist on remote servers. You may not be able to access old versions - especially since iCloud Drive itself doesn't do versioning: the latest version is all you get.

2) The entire feature has one configuration setting: On vs. Off. You cannot designate certain folders that must be kept locally at all times. You cannot exclude certain folders from remote storage. Etc.

3) The performance of the feature isn't great; it takes a while to download files, and you may want to access some of them right away.

4) When Apple's servers or your internet connection goes down, you absolutely lose access to the files. If you're using a laptop and don't have a high-bandwidth network connection, many of your files may be inaccessible, or accessible only after a lengthy delay.

5) Storage is cheap! A pure (non-hybrid) Western Digital 1TB SSD costs $190. All of the risks and challenges of keeping your files backed up to iCloud Drive remotely, and losing access to them locally, vanish if you're backing up to and/or just plain using an SSD. Indeed, this might even be a little more performant than installing both your OS and your data / apps on the same drive.",1536724481.0

nerpTV,Could you turn on iCloud desktop? Then just create the folder off your desktop? Then it's just mirrored in real time in iCloud and locally and you don't have to mess with copying it over and keeping track of last-modified dates.,1536642324.0
sfsdfd,"If you're already using iCloud Drive, then it makes sense to keep using that for the actual backup. The only question is how to copy the folder automatically from local_folder_location to remote_folder_location.

If you're minimally familiar with using the terminal, then you have all the tools you need. Literally two steps, entering two simple lines of text in the right places, will do it.

(1) Make a one-line script somewhere that pushes the files. This is really simple - just use nano or a text editor of your choice, and put the following line in a text file with a .sh extension:

    cp -a /some/path/to/your/local_folder_location ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~clouddocs/

(Note that if either path has any spaces in it, you'll have to escape them with a backslash. So, above, the folder called ""Mobile Documents"" is listed as ""Mobile\ Documents"".)

Save the script somewhere with a .sh filename, like ~/copy.sh. Make it runnable:

    chmod 700 ~/copy.sh

Then try running it and see what it does. If you get any error messages, try reading them and solving them. If the script runs fine, then you're 90% of the way there.

(2) Make the file run periodically using the cron utility.

Run this command:

    env EDITOR=nano crontab -e

This will use nano, a very user-friendly text editor, to edit the file that lists how your processes are scheduled. It's probably empty, so enter this line:

    */15 * * * * ~/copy.sh

That line indicates that the script ~/copy.sh should run every 15 minutes. If you've saved the script anywhere else, you can change the path; if you want to run the script more or less often, change the number.

Save the crontab file (ctrl-x, Y). You're done.

machone,"iCloud isn't a backup solution.. you want something like CrashPlan.

Or, create an alias to your iCloud/Dropbox and save your files there.

Or, create an automator workflow that watches your folder and does that copy.

Or, write a shell script or AppleScript to do it and run it either manually or figure out how to automate it (I'm not sure how to have scripts run on a schedule in macOS these days).",1536642794.0
alllmossttherrre,"There are some Mac backup/sync utilities out there that you can leave running in the background, watching folders for changes, and when a folder changes because you update a file, it can copy it to another location like the local folder for iCloud Drive. I'm pretty sure Carbon Copy Cloner can do this, for example. If they can't watch a folder in real time, they can at least check the folder at a scheduled interval.

But since you're in a programming class, there is probably a way to code up your own solution using rsync, which is a Unix command line backup program I am aware of. I am also aware that macOS has a facility for monitoring changed files called [fsevents](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/FSEvents_ProgGuide/UsingtheFSEventsFramework/UsingtheFSEventsFramework.html). I suppose you could use fsevents to watch the folder for changes and then use rsync to copy the files. But I am not a programmer so I don't have the first clue of how to do that.

I am using Mojave (on a newer MacBook Pro now) and have notice that it runs significantly better than High Sierra. Of course the biggest changes between Yosemite and High Sierra is under the hood (APFS) and a few other system changes.

Beerbaron23,"The difference in power consumption between releases of OSX would be neglidgeable, batteries stay the same size and most OS processes are light on the power. If everything is running as it should then downgrading is pointless. So no do not downgrade and no downgrading will not effect the processing power required to view Youtube. Making choices like using Safari to watch Youtube clips instead of Chrome will make a huge difference. Also be sure that you are NOT running an Anti-Virus resident app.

You should be more concered with what 3rd party apps your using, what you have running at all times in the background and making sure no app or process went rogue on yah and stuck in a loop draining your battery.


Here is a bunch of things to go through to make sure your MBP is running efficiently.


Check these following locations, in these directories are .plist files that OSX will read and launch it’s corresponding service during start-up. Remove junk that you know what they are and if you know it’s unneeded rubbish. Then Google the ones your not sure of and see if they can be removed or not.

These Locations:




/Users/*YourUserNameHere”/Library/LaunchAgents

/Library/LaunchAgents


/Library/LaunchDaemons


/Library/StartupItems



Make sure you have enough disk space free on your harddisk that is equal to your amount of ram installed or greater. Have 8GB of ram? make sure you don’t go below 8GB of HD space. 16GB? then don’t go below 16GB HD space. Reason being is that OSX needs that space to use for virtual memory at a moments notice.


Next make better choices on which programs you use daily, the biggest offender is Google Chrome which uses much more memory and CPU then the competition (times have changed and Chrome is no longer the fastest browser). If you are a power user then switch to the new Firefox Quantum which was just rebuilt ground up with multiprocess optimization in mind. It can handle more tabs at once, use less ram when using 15 tabs+ and handle more tabs while using less CPU. If you are on the go relying on your battery then Safari should be the only browser loaded as it is unmatched for power consumption.

There are also many applications that rely on the “Electron Framework”, these programs essentially run there own in individual copy of Chrome to operate, further bogging down your comp. Google search for a list of apps using Electron, find which ones apply to you and then find alternatives or use those Electron based programs sparingly.


Run “Activity Monitor” in the background and keep an eye on which processes are using way too much CPU and/or RAM, make note of those processes and figure out if they are acting that way do to a bug in that process.

Normal items with high usage that you will find and how they should be acting:

Kernel_Task: This is the OSX kernel (Central process that controls the workload requests of your comp/processor), it’s normal that it uses a high amount but not a constant 100% on idle. This is a required service, OSX wont work without the heart.

WindowServer: This is the Quartz windowing server/compositor which is responsible for drawing all the windows on your screen, normal to be in heavy use. This is a required service.

mds_stores: There are multiple of these, usually 4, mostly highly active on each boot. These catalogue the data on your HD for use in apps such as spotlight and for use for the find command in Finder. On first install of OSX or major upgrade these can be running full tilt for hours (as in over night hours) until it catalogs your whole HD. Once complete they should not be using much at all and be mostly idle, only briefly here and there or upon a fresh reboot for maybe about 20 mins. If they keep using all your CPU after these points mentioned earlier then most likely they’ve ran into a bug with the database they are building and will constantly slow your OSX. Google search on how to rebuild your Spotlight mds database to correct these problems.


YaraScan and MRT: OSX built in malware scanner, runs at boot time. If using alot of CPU, check it’s RAM usage as well. If it’s using GB’s of ram and keeps climbing at a steady rate then Force Quit YaraScan and investigate a solution (You will have to Force Quit it on each cold boot as well)

There are two possible solutions i know from the top of my head that could get your access back or at least should make you able to log in again.

The first is booting up the Recovery HD (CMD + R on boot) and opening Terminal via Utilities > Terminal.

After the terminal window opens simply type `resetpassword` and press return, a dialog should open which will allow you to reset the password of the account.

Keep in mind that when/if FileVault is active you will have to unlock the disk first via Disk Utility (mount it and it'll prompt for a password)

​

The second option is creating a secondary administrator account, repeat the steps above to boot up the Recovery HD and open the terminal, make sure the disk is mounted if FileVault is active and do type the following: `rm /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/var/db/.AppleSetupDone` and press return. This assumes the disk macOS is installed on is named ""Macintosh HD"" if it's not adjust where necessary.

After this you need to reboot and you will be prompted to run the initial macOS setup again and this will allow you to set up a second administrator account, this should give you access back to the Macbook and probably your moms data as well. Keep in mind that when creating a new account that you do not use your Moms AppleID to create it, the account could possibly be compromised.

When you have access to the machine do run the necessary scans to rule out malware.

If you use the Carbon Copy Cloner CCCUserAgent, then the disk space consumed can be compounded by CCC making its own snapshots.

I believe this is what causes System to take up so much space.

You can view APFS snapshots by opening Terminal and typing:

tmutil listlocalsnapshots /

More info here:

Or if you use CCC, click on a volume name and it will list the same snapshots. See screen shot here:

[https://bombich.com/kb/ccc5/leveraging-snapshots-on-apfs-volumes](https://bombich.com/kb/ccc5/leveraging-snapshots-on-apfs-volumes)

(Edit: I find it amusing that the screen shot shows snapshots in KB. Mine are no smaller than MB and GB!)

Then you can delete the biggest snapshots. The first link shows how to delete them in Terminal. I have CCC so it's easier to delete with point 'n click.

If this is the cause, you do not need to do any intensive file culling or offloading. If you list your snapshots you will probably find that there are an alarming number of GB taken up by a few big snapshots that can just be deleted to free up all that space. (Always make sure you have a good backup, so that it is safe to delete those snapshots.)

It would be worth to try booting 10.12 on the iMac Pro.

However, I would suggest not doing this. I would jump to using Adobe Premiere CC. With little work you can make it almost like FCP7 in terms of window and keyboaed layout. With Premiere you have the advantage of fast rendering, tons of plugins and easy migration from FCP7. 

FCP X is great, but depending on what workflow you or your users are having, it might be hard to use.

If you need to migrate FCP7 projects to X or Premiere you could install a virtual machine with an older Mac OS just to be able to convert the project to XML.

ciera22,Just bite the bullet and upgrade to an SSD. Even if you forget about doing the RAM the SSD by itself is an essential upgrade ,1535838249.0
Beerbaron23,"For the upgrade, if you currently have only 4GB ram, then upgrade to 8GB as the first upgrade. If you already have 8GB or more ram then go with an SSD as the first upgrade instead. A 2012 Macbook with an Core i5, 8GB ram and an SSD would give you many years of excellent service left...


Check these following locations, in these directories are .plist files that OSX will read and launch it’s corresponding service during start-up. Remove junk that you know what they are and if you know it’s unneeded rubbish. Then Google the ones your not sure of and see if they can be removed or not.


**These Locations:**




/Users/""YourUserNameHere”/Library/LaunchAgents

/Library/LaunchAgents


/Library/LaunchDaemons


/Library/StartupItems





Make sure you have enough disk space free on your harddisk that is equal to your amount of ram installed or greater. Have 8GB of ram? make sure you don’t go below 8GB of HD space. 16GB? then don’t go below 16GB HD space. Reason being is that OSX needs that space to use for virtual memory at a moments notice.




Next make better choices on which programs you use daily, the biggest offender is Google Chrome which uses much more memory and CPU then the competition (times have changed and Chrome is no longer the fastest browser). If you are a power user then switch to the new Firefox Quantum which was just rebuilt ground up with multiprocess optimization in mind. It can handle more tabs at once, use less ram when using 15 tabs+ and handle more tabs while using less CPU. If you are on the go relying on your battery then Safari should be the only browser loaded as it is unmatched for power consumption.



There are also many applications that rely on the “Electron Framework”, these programs essentially run there own in individual copy of Chrome to operate, further bogging down your comp. Google search for a list of apps using Electron, find which ones apply to you and then find alternatives or use those Electron based programs sparingly.




Run “Activity Monitor” in the background and keep an eye on which processes are using way too much CPU and/or RAM, make note of those processes and figure out if they are acting that way do to a bug in that process.



*Normal items with high usage that you will find and how they should be acting:*



**Kernel_Task:** This is the OSX kernel (Central process that controls the workload requests of your comp/processor), it’s normal that it uses a high amount but not a constant 100% on idle. This is a required service, OSX wont work without the heart.



**WindowServer:** This is the Quartz windowing server/compositor which is responsible for drawing all the windows on your screen, normal to be in heavy use. This is a required service.



**mds_stores:** There are multiple of these, usually 4, mostly highly active on each boot. These catalogue the data on your HD for use in apps such as spotlight and for use for the find command in Finder. On first install of OSX or major upgrade these can be running full tilt for hours (as in over night hours) until it catalogs your whole HD. Once complete they should not be using much at all and be mostly idle, only briefly here and there or upon a fresh reboot for maybe about 20 mins. If they keep using all your CPU after these points mentioned earlier then most likely they’ve ran into a bug with the database they are building and will constantly slow your OSX. Google search on how to rebuild your Spotlight mds database to correct these problems.




**YaraScan** and **MRT:** OSX built in malware scanner, runs at boot time. If using alot of CPU, check it’s RAM usage as well. If it’s using GB’s of ram and keeps climbing at a steady rate then Force Quit YaraScan and investigate a solution (You will have to Force Quit it on each cold boot as well)




*Hard-Disk permission errors and general errors can slow down your MacBook.*



Make sure to run “First Aid” in Disk Utility on your whole HD as a unit and on your current OSX HD partition to make sure your filesystem is in check. Another thing to try is to rebuild your file permissions in OSX. Open your Terminal application and type this line: “diskutil resetUserPermissions / `id -u`”

Quitting DDAssist from the Activity Monitor makes the square disappear, starting it again makes it reappear.

Interestingly enough, I cannot get whatever message it's trying to show me to appear. It's not a window out of bounds (otherwise it would be moved onto the screen during Mission Control) and changing the screen resolution/scaling does not reveal it.

GoldenBough,"Here's the biggest thing that you need to know out of the gate:

macOS is *not* Windows. Don't try and cram the Windows workflow that you're accustomed to through macOS. Try and change as little as possible (aside from basic system preferences) until you've tried it, understand what Apple is going for, and disagree with it. It's a very *considered* OS, and things are the way they are for a reason. Once it all kind of clicks, then it feels natural and Windows feels... off.

I'll give you a few specific suggestions as well.

Use Safari. Install Chrome for sites that need it, but try and use Safari as your daily driver. It's the browser built for the OS, buy the makers of the OS, and it integrates in a way that nothing else can.

Put your dock on the side. Left if you're a cool kid, right if you're an abomination. You have way more horizontal pixels than vertical ones, take advantage of that.

Keyboard shortcuts leverage the Option key heavily. If you have a menu dropdown open, hold Option and see what alternative shortcuts are available.

If you hold the Command key, you can move windows that aren't focused. You can also scroll them by scrolling with the mouse hovered on them (I think Windows does this as well).",1535598180.0

* Spotify

* WhatsApp
* Simplenote (although will be switching to Notes.app once I get an iPhone)
* Sublime Text (programmers text editor)

* iTerm (although the built in Terminal.app is actually very good)
* Bitwarden (password manager)
* Amphetamine (stops the machine from sleeping when watching movies)
* BetterTouchTool (make that touchbar worth the money you paid for it!)
* Magnet (like Spectacle that others have mentioned, allows for Windows-like app snapping)
* AppCleaner (tidies up config files and such when uninstalling an app)
* Hex Fiend (hex editor)
* IINA (really nice media player, uses mpv so is sexy)
* Scrivener (as I like to write)
* VLC (although I prefer IINA sometimes it has bugs as it is in beta so this is my backup)
* NordVPN (I work a lot out of the house so I use a VPN most times. Not saying NovdVPN is the best but it is has good speeds, a nice app and a fair price if you buy it for a year or two at a time)
* Homebrew (I use Homebrew to install most apps as it is so quick)

I try and use the built in apps when possible. The only exceptions are Safari and iTunes but I will give them a good go in Mojave I think. There are just one or two little Chrome features I really like which prevents me switching today and I have Spotify for a few more months so I will give Apple Music a try after. 

I spent some time to customise the touchbar with BetterTouchTool so it shows me WhatsApp, Discord, Slack and Facebook Messenger notifications along with a ""mini dock"" of my most used apps, Spotify media controls and info, AirPod quick connect button, date and time and weather. It is awesome. Here are two photos of it in action now. https://imgur.com/a/BbXEKMN. The white square after the Finder button is to zoom a window but not go full screen. The AirPods is a quick connect/disconnect button. It goes blue when AirPods are connected :)

First, login to account B on computer B and create a shared folder. (System Preferences / Sharing / File Sharing. Create or select a shared folder and write permissions to ""everyone."") Note the line that reads:

> Other users can access shared folders on this computer, and administrators all volumes, at (some URL like smb://192.168.0.12).

Now, whenever you want to copy a file to account B on computer B - from any account on any computer - you can just open the shared folder on computer B and copy files there. For example - on computer A, open Finder, select ""Go / Connect to Server"" (or hit Command+K), and then type in the URL noted above. Finder will show you the contents of the shared folder on computer B, and you can copy stuff into and out of it as you like.

(Note: You are creating this shared folder with full permissions for every other computer on the local area network. Don't do this on a public network where computers you don't trust can access the folder. Don't do this with sensitive data that you don't want anyone else on the network to access.

tvOS

watchOS

iOS

~~OS X~~ macOS

So the reason why it is referred to as OS X, is just because the operating system was released before Apple started calling it MacOS. Also, Apple still does use the numbering system but they don't want to confuse the average consumer with a bunch of numbers. All Mac OS's have been numbered and named since the beginning of OS X (10.0 Cheetah).",1535347920.0

The issue in your case is that the item has a variable name depending on the amount of the files/folders selected...

what you can theoretically do is create shortcuts for all needed possibilities (without quotes): 

""Rename 2 Items...""  
""Rename 3 Items...""  
""Rename 4 Items...""  
""Rename  5 Items...""

Of course that is impractical but if you still wanna go with this solution then instead of doing it the typical way using the link provided above  you can do some script that automatically fills the assassinated plist file for keyboard shortcuts: check here: [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/87619/where-are-keyboard-shortcuts-stored-for-backup-and-sync-purposes](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/87619/where-are-keyboard-shortcuts-stored-for-backup-and-sync-purposes)

wolf_ie,"I used to use a Mac Mini as a media server and general downloading/offloading machine, because it was cheap for a Mac, quiet and power efficient.

What was the biggest drawback of this setup, the drawback that caused me to replace it with a Linux system on generic PC hardware? Apple’s love-hate relationship with the Mini. They love it for a few years, then it’s out in the cold and left to rot with ageing specs and the rumour mill starts whispering about discontinuation. Then a couple of years later it gets a stellar upgrade and they love it again. Couple of years of moderate upgrades and then it gets a total blinder of a bump and you can buy a quad i7 unicorn. Then no update for two years, then a crappy update, then no update for four years.

I’ve been around this cycle since the beginning and I’m fed up of depending on hardware where Apple can’t decide on whether it’s actually important or not. I need that system because all the rest of my devices are iOS and that works great because I offload a bunch of stuff to the server. I need to know that a brand new, up to date, drop-in replacement will be available in case of the logic board shitting itself, and Apple just will not commit to the product line enough to make me believe them and not think I’m just going to be back in this position in a few years.

sfsdfd,"(1) MacOS provides a more consistent, glitch-free user experience.

When I use Windows, I find that features spontaneously break. Settings spontaneously change or revert to defaults. The UI frequently provides incorrect or confusing information. Every time you boot, you get a different experience - maybe things will work, maybe not. It's like an adventure, except it's not any fun.

MacOS doesn't do that as much. It does *sometimes,* but for the most part it's a stable and dependable system.

(2) MacOS is far easier to administrate.

With every iteration since Windows Vista, the Windows administrative experience has become fragmented. Windows 10 has three different control panels: Windows Settings, the ""classic control panel"" left over from Windows Vista/7 version, and the Windows XP/2000 console-based administrative panels (""Computer Management"") - and they present disjoint, conflicting sets of options and information.

The registry is *absurdly* awful. It's still a gigantic ugly tree, just like it was in Windows XP - but now it has a layer of awful security slathered on top. Need to change a single setting through the registry, like the scroll direction of a touchpad? Plan to set aside 20-30 minutes so you can bunch of guides about ""Taking Ownership"" and setting permissions on the ""Wheel"" account. Plan to read several guides since the first few won't work right. Might need to reboot into Safe Mode to disable system-wide security, and then reboot into Windows to change the value, and then remember to reboot into Safe Mode again to reenable security, and then back to Windows.

That excruciatingly bad security clings to everything. Sometimes you can't delete a shortcut on the desktop that *you just created* because you don't have permission. Sometimes you can't finish emptying your recycle bin because *you don't have permission* to delete a particular sub-sub-sub-subfolder. If you upgraded from Windows 8, you'll have a ""WINDOWS.OLD"" folder that contains a complete backup of your old OS, and you don't have permission to delete it. There are a probably 100 guides on the internet advising you how to delete it... and 97 of them don't work.

MacOS has one control panel and a pretty reasonable security model. The End.

Oh, sure, you can read some guides and plunk some commands into PowerShell to tear them out, and maybe break some critical Windows components in the process. Don't worry: Windows Update will helpfully reinstall all of them for you.

neilalexanderr,"Primarily because there are a lot of paradigms in the user interface that are actually consistent compared to Windows. Some examples that immediately spring to mind:

1. The menubar at the top of the screen, which is always there, and never defies expectation
2. Document-based applications - file can be moved on the filesystem whilst open in an app without getting a ""File in use"" error like on Windows, files can often be renamed, tagged and moved right from the titlebar, ""Duplicate"" in the menu to open a new copy of the document
3. Application windows being grouped under one top-level application process, i.e. multiple Word documents belonging to one Word icon in the dock, being able to close all of them at once reliably (rather than Windows' rather more haphazard approach) and cycle through them with Cmd-Backtick
4. Very clear indicator under the Dock icons to suggest whether an application is open or not, whether it is left running in the background or if it has closed after closing the last window
5. Standard right-click menu actions on most text fields system-wide, including spelling/grammar, substitutions, transformations into upper/lower case 
6. Screenshotting is excellent, especially when you want to take a screenshot of a single window (Cmd-Shift-4 followed by Space) and it produces a clean shadowed screenshot of that single window straight to the Desktop - no cropping needed
7. Spotlight, which very easily can produce combined search queries, i.e. kind ""image"", date ""yesterday"", filename ""something"", returning results extremely quickly and without getting confused in the process

Windows feels very much like a minefield - modern UWP apps work one way, legacy Win32 apps work another, some things are in Settings, others are buried in the (now totally hidden) Control Panel, some applications have menubar and others don't, some applications have custom window chrome.",1535053183.0

Exposé - I know Windows 10 has something similar now, but going from XP to Tiger this was one of unexpected things that won me over. Absolutely essential.

A LOT can be accomplished by dragging and dropping stuff. 

Unmounting volumes/disconnecting network shares/ejecting CDs is done by dragging the icon to trash. It just makes sense

Finder just sorta gets out of the way and lets me deal with my files, whereas Windows Explorer always has me overwhelmed with its UI.

Previews work great - quick look is super convenient, icon previews work not just on images, but on like a bajilion file formats, and the preview.app is simply goat.

On related note - PDF handling is smooth sailing.

Printing and scanning is less frustrating to me, both initial setup and day to day use.

Core Audio makes connecting various audio devices a breeze.

A lot of useful keyboard shortcuts.

You can hide windows (cmd-h) instead of minimising them. 

Aliases are in my experience flexible than Windows shortcuts - you can move the original file, and the alias will get redirected.

You install 90% of the apps by dragging an icon to “Applications” folder. You uninstall by dragging to trash.

suihcta,"One thing I don’t see people talk a lot is how apps work and how the OS is licensed. 

In Windows, even the most simple apps start with an “installer.exe” which litters God knows how many random support files and DLLs all over your system.

In macOS, installing an app is a matter of dragging the *.app file into your /Applications folder. Or not. It won’t really care where you run it from. The first time it runs, it will create a preferences file in ~/Library/Preferences, and it may store some assets in ~/Library/Application Support. The reason for that is so each user on the system can have a different experience but share the same /Applications folder. The average user doesn’t need to concern himself with that stuff though because it happens in the background. Launching an app for the first time is no different from opening a document. (This is all assuming you didn’t download the app from the App Store, which is very pleasant in a totally different way.)

With Windows, your OS installation is connected with your machine’s OEM and is licensed to your motherboard. Upgrading from one version of Windows to another is usually simple enough, but upgrading to a new machine generally means throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

Apple doesn’t sell software like Microsoft does. They sell computers, and those computers run their software at no cost. This is a totally different paradigm that manifests itself in a lot of different ways, but my favorite is how the OS is installed in such a way that makes it device-agnostic. When I want to upgrade to a new Mac, I can just swap the hard drives. Or clone one to another with a cable. Or I can drag and drop the parts I want to keep while ignoring the parts I don’t. I’ve never needed to “start over”. All of my apps and preferences and all the customized details of my installation have just carried over from one Mac to the next for the last 14 years. I can just as easily install macOS onto an external hard drive, a flash drive, or even an SD card and it’s completely portable—it will boot on any compatible Mac. I don’t need a product key because Apple doesn’t care about that stuff anymore. I can connect two Macs with a cable and use one to boot the internal drive of another.

Why should I have to buy a product only to have to support it at the same time. It should just work and my MBP just works. My Windows machine just causes work. As a result of my terrible experience with Windows in the last 2 years, I’m slowly hanging up my gaming hat to avoid Windows completely. It’s just not worth it anymore. ",1535089043.0

After going through a Dell and a Lenovo laptop in college I decided to try a MacBook Air and it's been perfect for exactly that purpose. It just works and I never have to worry about it, that's all. It does really well at what it's supposed to do but I still have a purpose for Windows on another machine. ",1535050886.0

MoistBall,"I love my MacBook Pro 2016 w/ TouchBar. Its a workhorse that lets me edit photos and videos and I am part of the minority that actually likes the keyboard and big trackpad. The display is one of the best for a laptop I have ever used. The Touch Bar people call a gimmick and sure Apple's implementation leaves a lot to desire but thats why I bought Better Touch Tool and customized the whole thing to they way I want it. I like Mac OS so much that I couldn't not using. 

&#x200B;

So I decided to turn my desktop into a Hackintosh to have Mac OS there too. I have an 8700k, RX 580, 32 GB RAM, plenty of SSDs and HDDs and im running High Sierra stable. Its on 24/7 as a Plex media server and I access my files from anywhere because my HDDs are shared. Used to have just windows on there but ever since I got into the Hackintosh world and especially after I upgraded my hardware to the 8700k etc., I haven't looked back to windows at all. Another big reason is because now I can have the same integration I had before with my MBP + iPad + iPhone + AirPods but now I can have my ""iMac"" included too. At a fraction of the cost of an iMac (similar specs don't exist yet from Apple and if they do its $$$), I have a beast photo and video editing machine and the RX 580 graphics card isn't a slouch with games either. Obviously if you REALLY want better performance you can get Nvidia which also works these days very well with Mac OS with certain drivers. 

&#x200B;

Mac OS is just fluid and cohesive across the entire OS which is much more of a joy to use than Windows which has UI elements that are all over the place even within the same apps. There have been countless complaints about this and some articles outline the issue pretty clearly if you want a reference. With Mojave coming out soon, we'll get system wide Dark Mode and it looks awesome in the betas so far. Windows seems to be also coming out with this but again, the fluidity of Mac OS and the consistency across the whole OS is just better.

&#x200B;

And Time Machine is bae #1. No equivalent and I love that its implemented pretty well and its free and native in Mac OS.

&#x200B;

A lot of people also complained about USB C on the MBPs but geez I don't get the issue. My USB C workstation setup at my desk is perfect. I plug in one cable to my MBP and it recognizes my 4k display, charges my laptop, hooks up to time machine to start automatically backing up, web camera for FaceTime calls, ethernet, and Logitech speakers. All through ONE cable. I can set aside my MBP in clamshell mode and use a bluetooth keyboard and trackpad and I have a desktop like experience. Ofc my Hackintosh has largely replaced this but prior to that this is the setup I used and it worked wonderfully and still does whenever I want to. I don't know any windows laptop that would CONSISTENTLY just plug and work and not have UI elements all over the place or have to keep plugging in and unplugging the cable to get things to show up. Things scale well in Mac OS and it Just works (haven't we heard of that before)

Satzlefraz,"I prefer the day to day experience of MacOS for sure. It looks nice, runs very well, and doesn't have a lot of bloat.

What I don't like is that there isn't necessarily the ability to change a lot of things.

For example. I have a 21:9 monitor that I use with my macbook pro. This is wonderful for most things except gaming. ""You shouldn't game on mac!"" Sure, but when I'm too lazy to change systems, sometimes I like to play some light games on the machine. The problem? The games will only run in 21:9. This machine can't handle 3440x1440, I would prefer to run things at 1920x1080. On windows, this would be as simple as going into the game's .ini and changing a line. On macOS the solution is to: Take macbook pro out of clamshell mode. Make it the main monitor, now change the resolution to 1080p, and now drag that window on to the ""secondary"" 21:9 monitor.

That's atrocious and I refuse to do that.

marafad,"Consistency is probably the biggest thing for me.

MacOS is overall much more consistent than Windows. The UI is more consistent, you find most stuff where you'd expect it to be. It doesn't come preloaded with useless stuff you can't get rid of, but then lacks on the basics.
 
Only after years and years Windows thought that including a PDF reader was probably a good idea (and even that, it's because Edge has one, so it has to open a browser to open a PDF). I find that one to be ridiculous, can ANYONE go without a PDF reader? MacOS one is not even that advanced, but I think it covers most use cases.

Until sometime ago I think it was the same for archives, wtf, seriously. It's like the operating system doesn't want to include the most basic stuff.

And don't get me wrong, MacOS has a lots of flaws and even if I find it overall more reliable it has often crashed on me. Anyone that tells you that MacOS doesn't crash or is virus free - it's complete BULLSHIT. But I've certainly experienced less off or unexpected behaviour than on Windows.

I don't even care for the apple ""ecosystem"". It's good sure, but you can achieve a similar level of integration with 3rd party apps, just not out of the box.

And then there's it being nix compliant, as a developer (that doesn't develop for Windows obviously) it just makes life a lot easier. But if not a power user or a developer you won't care for any of that and will probably never open the terminal in your life, but you'll still find that setting you're looking for a lot faster than on Windows, for sure.",1535062101.0
MostUncreativePerson,"If I had to chose one thing that differentiates MacOS from Windows it's all the gestures you get with your trackpad. I was blown away when I first got to really use the trackpad for productivities sake and not just because it was kinda nice to use and look at. I really get why people prefer the Magic Trackpad over a regular mouse when using a Mac. 

&#x200B;

This is coming from a dev's perspective btw. 

&#x200B;

Using a trackpad on MacOS gives you a far more fluent workflow over any mouse. You can open up 2-3 virtual desktops easily, being able to switch between them with just a 4 finger swipe. If you have more than one window open on a single desktop you use a 4 finger swipe upwards to open Mission Control (a view where you can see all the windows on a desktop at once) and click on the one you want to use. If you want to move a window you use a 3 finger hold (without clicking the trackpad which makes it super convenient and easy to do) and just swipe around on the trackpad. Plus Apple got the trackpad acceleration perfect to a point where you can use it for the first time and already use it like you'd use mouse. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Everything feels fluent and nice to use and at least for me it boosted my productivity greatly compared to working on a Windows machine.

&#x200B;

And I also love some things that other people hate. Like the Touch Bar for example. 

A big part of MacOS is the flawless integration of fullscreen for more or less all the apps. One thing you lose when going fullscreen is the time and battery percentage meter that would be shown in the top bar. With a few hours invested into Better Touch Tool I made my Touch Bar display all those important things so I can always keep track of my working hours and see when I'm working too slowly or when it's time to plug in my MacBook to have it charged fully for when I leave. Plus it shows me my current track playing on Spotify in addition to a couple dynamic controls for music. And even on the Touch Bar you can have gestures. I've mapped the 2 finger swipe to change the volume, 3 finger swipe to change the screen brightness and a four finger swipe to change the keyboard backlight. It's super nice and convenient to use and obviously a nice productivity booster since you always have necessary information displayed right there.

&#x200B;

And I didn't even begin with the pretty much hassle free OS on it's own. Want to install an app? Just download it and drag it to your applications folder. Want to uninstall it? Just drag it from your applications folder to the trash bin. That's it. Same thing goes for pretty much everything you can think about. Be it accepting calls, saving and using passwords in Safari or something mandatory like using Spotlight (basically Windows search, but it actually works and is far more advanced)

&#x200B;

ctesibius,"For me, computers are just a tool, and I want to pay attention to the job I'm doing, not spend my time persuading the tool to work. Currently MacOS is the best desktop OS in respect of staying out of the way while I get on with the job. Windows used to be reasonably good up to Win7 - not quite as good, but useable. Now it is distracting and it seems that Microsoft have lost the plot as far as utility is concerned.

Normally everything in MacOS GUI works as you would expect it to work - and by that I mean that if you want to do something new, you can probably guess how to do it. (That's the GUI - the command line is not as predictable). One thing I particularly like is that the basic install of the operating system has a lot of good stuff in it. TextEdit and Preview in particular do much more than their names would suggest. The backup system (Time Machine) is not unique (it is based on the ideas of `rsnapshot` from Linux, which itself is a script based around `rsync`) - but it is so easy to use compared to any Windows backup utility.

It's definitely not perfect in the Mac world though. MacOS is great, but Mac hardware is going in the other direction. We used to be able to get machines that offered genuine utility. The Apple web site had PDFs showing how to replace your hard disk or RAM, and there were things like the MacBook Pro mobile workstations, which prioritised large screens and fast processing over size. These days every damn machine is as thin as possible and unmaintainable - basically larger or smaller MacBook Air notebooks for consultants and students, whatever they call them. The whole lot is summed up by the existed of those stupid mice that were deliberately designed to stop you charging them while you use them.

cmcguinness,"I can answer in a story: When the iPad was released, I thought ""it ought to be fun to write apps for this"".  (I was wrong about that, BTW, in pre-automatic reference counting ObjectiveC).  But I discovered I couldn't  do that on my windows box, so I got a Mac Mini and a KVM switch.  My intent was just to use the Mac for iOS dev, and Windows for everything else.  I have been using Windows since 3.1, and felt like I knew it backwards and forwards.  

The switching back and forth lasted about 4 weeks, and after that I had bought all the MAC software I needed (e.g., from MS Office to dev tools) to shelf the Dell.  Windows got reduced to a VM, and the physical windows boxes were sent to the attic.

I can't tell you why I liked the Mac better.  But it really was just easier to use, more reliable, and I felt more productive on it.  Eventually, I BYOD'd an Air to covertly replace my company issued Lenovo, because I was getting tired using XP.

I guess the answer is that it just feels like there's so much less friction with the Mac to get my work done.  And I love the fact that there's one version of OS (no crippleware Home version), and upgrades seem to be perpetually free.

marman_,"I grew up with Windows but switched to Mac about five or six years ago. I think MacOS is just more noob-friendly. It's intuitive and it makes things simple, from Spotlight (basically a search feature of your entire computer + suggestions from online. Two-button shortcut), to QuickLook (preview a file without opening the app. Single-button shortcut), to the simplicity of customizing your preferences. It does a great job of dumbing things down to a level that everyone of all tech proficiencies can understand and pick up easily.

&#x200B;

Hardware is solid. My 2009 iMac is still running well, though not as fast as I'd like, but my 2015 MacBook Pro has never underperformed (my most taxing apps are Adobe Ai, Id, and Ps), and although the keyboard isn't the best, it's by no means bad, so much so that I've grown most comfortable to Mac keyboards and prefer it over all else (the older model keyboards. New ones lack ""press depth"" for me). You don't get to upgrade components as easily as you would with a Windows PC, which is sad, but I never felt the need to.

&#x200B;

Also, I think a big part of it is the Apple Ecosystem. As much of a buzzword as it may seem, the Apple Ecosystem is real. It's what pulled me out of Android and into iOS. If you are a stock Google user, you would understand. The ease of integrating and transferring data without a thought makes it so good. I love being able to reply to SMS through my laptop, and sure you can get 3rd party software to do that on Windows, but I never felt it was as responsive as iMessage. I think that although other alternative apps for various OSs are available around, Apple provides built-in apps that make you *want* to use it rather than find alternatives, which makes you even more inclined to their products.

&#x200B;

I think overall, MacOS is just very well designed. It looks more natural (I personally think Windows looks *too techy* if that makes sense), feels more natural, and is simple enough for you not to need someone to teach you how to use it.

I'm a sucker for a good UI and it seems almost everyone who develops for Windows (including Microsoft themselves) couldn't give two craps about the UI. MS is improving by incorporating Fluent, which I actually really like, but it's very inconsistent since it's a gradual rollout. For third party apps, so many are just plain hideous. If I ever try to bring up why so many applications look designed for Windows 2000, I always get the same two responses: 1) As long as it works, why does it matter? 2) Would you rather they sacrifice stability & efficiency for a fancy UI? And both of these responses are ridiculous. Apps on macOS, and even a couple rare Windows ones, show that you don't need to sacrifice design to have a stable & efficient app. It's rare I come across a macOS app that pains me to look at but that seems to be the case for 90% of Windows applications. For some reason there's a huge divide in the industry where if you care that your app looks decent then you can only program for macOS and if you're a Windows programmer, then the bare minimum in UI design apparently is good enough.

Windows updates are atrocious and now that windows 10 basically forces you to update whether you want to or not makes it that much more unbearable.

Windows 10 in particular subverts almost ALL of your administrative control.  If you try to brute force the OS to not auto-reboot after patching, it will remove your admin permissions even if you are using the admin account.  I found this out the hard way after removing the windows scheduled task responsible for auto reboots.  I thought I would be slick by killing that and it indeed DID stop the PC from restarting but discovered that the account after a while no longer had admin permissions and couldn't run windows updates because of... you guessed it, a lack of permissions.

dragging a program icon to the trash can to uninstall is brilliant and rarely leaves anything behind, certainly nothing like orphaned registry entries. An easy to understand settings/system menu vs the trash that they forced on us with windows 8 and now even going so far as to remove the control panel from the right click start menu shortcuts... like they're trying to force the control panel out of existence when there was never a problem with it to begin with.

I'm lucky to have the opportunity to use Windows, osx or Linux where I work, and will when needed use either, or sometimes like today I will be editing powershell scripts in an ide and testing them in Windows running full screen in fusion.

My personal reason is because I get access to the tools I love in the Linux command line through homebrew and I get the stability of osx. While getting and using the tools in Windows is getting easier with Ubuntu and other Linux all being available in Windows it still feels like a bit of an afterthought for me right now.",1535049982.0

Microsoft solved the problem by endlessly telling everyone their software is easy to use ... and selling training, books, consultants etc. to fill the gap. So, with Microsoft software, there is usually only one good way of doing things, and becoming a power user meaning learning these methods.

I have noticed an interesting side-effect, as most users first learn to use a computer on Microsoft software, they no longer consider the intuitive way of doing things, it never occurs to them, they actually expect everything to work using the shortcuts and methods they learned on Windows. So, we now have a new class of users who go from Windows to MacOS, but find it confusing, not intuitive. And Apple is adapting to this, making the system LESS intuitive with every release, and more Microsoft-like. At the same time, Microsoft is imitating Apple ... Really weird convergence.",1534777900.0

The essential thing to learn is that a `for` loop in POSIX shell loops over the lines of the thing you give it, in this case the output of `ls *.zip`. You may think that's a problem for `ls` since it outputs multiple columns in the terminal, but in fact, `ls` is smarter than that. If it can detect that the output is going to a terminal (i.e. a human) it will use columns; otherwise it outputs one entry per line. You can verify this yourself by forcing the output into `cat` rather than straight to the terminal: `ls | cat`.",1534622678.0

onan,">  I tried installing JS Blocker (NoScript equivalent) and it says ""permission for JS blocker: able to read passwords, forms, and credit card info"". Instantly uninstalled.

That's also true of the javascript-limiting extensions you use with Chrome or Firefox. Safari is just being more up front about telling you about it.

uBlock Origin does exist for Safari. But if your motivation is privacy, then Safari's content blockers should interest you far more than it, or anything available within other browsers.

The standard model that extensions use gives them the ability to read and change absolutely everything you see and do. They need to in order to function. And so there is a considerable history of extensions actually exfiltrating your data, or injecting ads into pages, or similar badness. Including cases in which previously-benign extensions have been purchased by malicious companies who then start doing such things to the entire existing installed base through updates.

The closest thing there is to a solution to this is the content blocker frameworks in safari, which _do not_ have access to anything you see, or even to information about your browsing activity. No similar facility exists with Firefox or Chrome.

You are right that there's a relative paucity of extensions for Safari. But the difference isn't quite so dire as that, especially regarding the particular things you're looking for.

",1534434121.0

Janchotheone,"You are absolutely right about Safari and lack of extensions. I was feeling the same void, when I made a move from Chrome to Firefox to Safari..

My safari extensions..

Downloaded from vendor:
- 1password

Downloaded from Mac App Store:
- Dark mode (replacement for something like stylish / stylus. Limited in functionality, but does exactly what I want it to do)
- Wipr (replacement for uBlock origin etc)

I absolutely can not trust extensions like NoScript / or HTTPS everywhere.

IMHO with Safari being pretty limiting
- It does not allow you to open self signed certs / invalid certs pages anymore, even if you ""accept risks"" as it is in FF
- It has anti tracking built in, which I just have to trust that Apple has done a good job with it https://www.wired.com/story/apple-safari-privacy-wwdc/
- and so on..

it already is step ahead when it comes to privacy etc, so do you really need all those extensions in the first place ? :)

Lastly..

I think Apple is so limiting, when it comes to its browsers extensions / customisations, because well.. its apple and also I believe with all the gimmick extensions running in background, it would not be as  resource friendly -> battery friendly as it is now.

On a recent MacBook Air with 128GB flash, it took about 5 hours to fully encrypt the drive and on my 1TB MBP it took about 26 hours total.

During the encoding time, you are free to do whatever you normally do with your mac - install stuff, reboot, shutdown, sleep, etc. and macOS will keep churning in the background until the disk is done.  It won't proactively tell you when it's done, either.

The only thing that can *really* mess things up is an unexpected termination of macOS while it's encoding... like if you hard power it, or crash it, or if there's a genuine hardware failure.  FV can deal with unexpected events, but sometimes shit happens and you get log entries like the ones you're seeing.

After reformatting and reinstalling, don't enable FV right away.  Make sure that there aren't any hardware issues by keeping an eye on logs for a few days.  If everything is clean, try FV again.

Kalfus,"So you're saying that when you type `cd` and `TAB` you get files too? cd should not do that as it stands for `c`hange `d`irectory. Sometimes cd can not resolve conflict, so if multiple directories all start with 'w' then cd wouldn't know which 'w' directory you need. Instead, press TAB twice and it would list everything that starts with 'w'. Remember that macOS and many Linux distros are Case Sensitive so w and W are two different things.

Here is an example for my home folder with multiple files that start with D:

`cd ~`         *(this will change to your home directory so you can test it out)*

`cd D TAB TAB`

>Desktop/     Documents/      Downloads/       Dropbox/

`cd Do TAB TAB`      *(typing the next letter will then resolve it to...)*

cmiller1,Have you tried exporting as a CSV and then use your text editor to find and replacing the commas with spaces or tabs or whatever you need?,1534248431.0
fatt_maddison,"Numbers does not support exporting a space delimited text file, no.

As mentioned elsewhere, my only suggestion would be to export as a csv file, then use a text editor to replace the commas with spaces.

I also would second the other commenters who have pointed out that using spaces as a delimiter is bad and weird and you should question that severely before going forward with an assumption that it's the right solution.",1534251020.0
ohnodoctor,"You can do it with Perl. For example, export as csv and then:

perl -0777 -pe 's/,/ /g input.csv > output.txt

That should do the trick. You could make it into an automator workflow and assign it to a hotkey if you use it a lot. 

I feel your pain, though. I have to process a lot of dumb file formats as a chemist, and so I have a big list of perl one-liners to turn those dumb file formats into csv files. A lot of time, the files are so big that I can't even open them in numbers or excel. I don't know why most instruments can't export or import data as a csv file directly. It would make my life much simpler.

tonedeath,"""tet files""? I don't understand this. Oh, wait, did you mean ""text files."" Ah, ok. My brain just couldn't figure that out at first.

Why would you want a space separated text file? This is bad for many reasons, especially because data in cells very often contain spaces. This is why tab separated or comma separated are generally the export formats for tabular data from spreadsheets or databases. Tabs or commas give you a much better chance of having each cell/field remain intact when imported into another program.

I've had decent success with comma separated values (as long as none of the data in cells \[from spreadsheets\] or fields \[from databases\] also contain commas). I've had better luck with tab separated export files because most spreadsheets and databases don't allow tabs in cells or fields (the tab key generally moves between cells and fields).

I think for a space separated export to work, you would need each field encapsulated in quotation marks to allow the spaces to work as a good cell/field separator. Not all programs are able to encapsulate each cell/field in quotation marks when exporting so, that's another reason why tab or comma separated exports generally work better.

Hope this helps. Good luck.",1534250547.0

Note: this does NOT appear to be resolvable via a simple, standard chmod or xattr.

I have been replacing that directory with an alternating symlink (I use two external HDDs named A and B to alternate offline backups to each for redundant copies) for the past few years, and it broke in upgrading to Mojave.

I have read some interesting articles about the new feature, and it seems to be a good thing in terms of security.  Unfortunately, I have yet to find a way to peek under the covers and manipulate it for my particular use case -- a simple batch script.  So, in the meantime, I continue to use my old MacBook Air that is one OS release behind (and cannot update to Mojave).

1. Sign out of iCloud on the Mac.

NeighborhoodONE,"Hi there, I know this is an old post, but this has happened to me, many times before. Please read this entire comment  before taking any action.

So heres my story: one day I open up my very expensive and very new macbook pro (2015) (yes I know this comment is posted in 2018 but the first time I encountered this problem was late 2016 or early 2017). Shockingly, the screen was completely black and not lighting up WHATSOEVER! everything else was functioning, lights on the keyboard, sound on the computer, etc. I tried everything, like you. I tried resetting RAM and all that other stuff. *I tried booting in safe mode. I literally tried everything thats suggested on the internet, whether through apple or other sites (such as reddit).*

Heres what I have to say: there is only ONE solution that actually solved my problem. But before I tell you, I must say this, this solution that DID WORK FOR ME AND YES IT SOLVED MY PROBLEM, will void any warranty or applecare insurance that you may have. So if you have applecare or a factory warranty or ANYTHING like that, please take your computer into a store and have a licensed professional look at your product. Anyways, I do not have applecare or any factory warranty or anything like that. But heres how I solved my problem: i took the back off of my computer (MacBook Pro 2015, 13 inch) and disconnected the battery. Leave it disconnected for about 1 minute or so, then reconnect the battery. 

Look, I cant guarantee this will solve your problem, but it solved my problem. Literally NOTHING else on the internet would work. But somewhere down the line I read about disconnecting the battery from the computer, and it worked for me. This is literally the only thing that solved my problem. After talking to an apple ""professional,"" I was told that the issues was with the logic board. After only 1.5 years, my computers logic board failed! What a surprise. But in a nutshell, the way I solved my problem was simply disconnecting the battery and reconnecting it. I've had this problem about 3 times in the last 2 or 3 years and the solution I provided has worked every time. 

Again, I cant guarantee that this will solve your problem, but if all else fails, give this a try (but again, do not do this if you have a factory warranty or insurance because disconnecting the battery or even removing the back cover will likely void whatever warranty/insurance you have). 

EDIT:
I've tried restarting in recovery mode as well, DOESNT WORK. 
Using an external monitor DOES WORK. I've connected an HDMI cable from my laptop to my TV and yes, it does work. I get the screen from my computer on my TV. but that's only a temporary solution. Again, literally the only solution I found on the ENTIRE INTERNET was disconnecting the battery, leaving it for about a minute or 2, then reconnecting it. Again, this will void whatever warranty you may have, but with me, I didnt have any warranty, so this was better than paying hundreds of dollars to Apple to fix a hardware problem that my dad helped me fix in 10 minutes ;). Good luck man, hopefully you read this comment before spending hundreds on Apple to fix your issue. I TRUELY HOPE my comment can help at least one person out there. Because I know what it's like to drop about $1000 on a new laptop and not have the funds to have it repaired, so I hope what I said can help someone out there in need.

Then you definitely should be getting the new MacBook Pro. The 2015 one got a reprieve by being sold for a couple years, but that's over now, so it's on its way to being unsupported in good time.

>Connectivity. I’m human, I misplace or don’t always remember dongles, however I’m fine with buying dedicated adapters for cables.

I just upgraded from a 2015 MBP to the 2018. And, my dongle count has gone down, actually.   With the old MBP, I had a bunch of dongles between thunderbolt, mini displayport , and USB. Now, nearly all of my port and interface needs are handled with [one mini dock.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071JV4NPS/?coliid=I22B7D3SWC6063)

>Am I going to notice a performance difference when doing any of the above between the two laptops? How about 3 years from now?

toyg,"The two machines are significantly different - more RAM, more cores, and a better video card. You would have a performance difference, although for your use-case it will likely be relatively incremental: long-running operations might take 10% or 20% less time, which is a lot in absolute terms; but if an operation goes from 5 minutes to 4, do you actually notice? In terms of UI responsiveness doing photo editing and and playing video, both machines are big enough to be smooth - today and in 3 years, it's not the '90s anymore. 

If your use-case were 3d and video rendering, I would say get the newer model, no question. As it is, both machines look suitable to me; the only difference you will really notice is in gaming, so you have to be honest with yourself on that side. Also note that the dongles are expensive, so your budget for the new model is likely short of $100 or so.

> will spending the extra $1500 now ensure I don't have to spend $1850 again in 4 years?

The one thing that can slightly mitigate this is one of Safari's biggest strengths: reader mode. Specifically, reader mode as _default_ page rendering, rather than something you need to invoke manually for every page.

And if none of the existing reader mode styles are quite to your liking, you can edit the css for them directly in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Safari.framework/Versions/A/Resources/. 

Unfortunately, there are things for which reader mode won't work out; it certainly won't help you with google search pages, as you mention. And this combines poorly with Safari's other biggest failing relative to Firefox, the lack of a discrete search field.

With HFS+ I had been capturing disk images as backups and could mount and use them to copy systems from one piece of hardware to another. Piece of cake.

APFS structure is a bit different from HFS+, if you look at your hard drive in Disk Utility, HFS+ drives typically show 2 “layers” (if hidden partitions are not showing) - the disk itself, and the HFS+ partition. This made sense to me. Creat an image of the HFS+ partition, you capture the OS drive.

With APFS, however, you get 3 “layers” - the disk, an APFS container, and your macOS partition within that container.

Apple says (I’m paraphrasing) that this allows all volumes within that APFS container will be able to share the space of that container. Problem is, that really borks things for people like me (and you) who were using monolithic imaging. I’ve heard third party tools like Carbon Cloner work ok, but haven’t tried.

rekt_brownie,It’s a BSD derivative and Unix certified,1532543313.0
pink_echoes,"Okay, history time, as I got tagged...

The original UNIX was developed at ATT Labs and at some point other groups developed their own version of the OS, most notable as a tree of such versions was BSD (mostly open source), while the ATT-tree was SystemV (mostly closed sorce). At some point also some guys disliked all the closed source stuff and started the GNU (GNUs not UNIX) project to build free/libre/opensource alternatives to the UNIX systems. Anyhow, the UNIX wars between SystemV and BSD came basically to an end when a) some companies decided to take the best of both (ATT and Sun's SunOS) and also the POSIX IEEE standard was created to deal with the mess.

Then the trademark for the brand UNIX was sold and all this resulted in other committees standardizing different things but who were also UNIX licensed. In the end, things cooled down and the Single Unix Specification was created as an industry standard.

Both standards now are related as the SUS is developed by the joint working groups and then ratified by IEEE making you pay a few hundred dollars for a nice IEEE logo on the cover page (hint: you can get the official PDF of the POSIX standard for free, legally, if you look close enough on the WG's web sites).

So who owns and decides what's UNIX now? Well, the UNIX brand has been sold to the OpenGroup who adminstrates it and also the creation of new standards of the SUS which become POSIX. So UNIX (as a brand certificate) and POSIX (as a standard compliance) are the same, you just have to pay for the first to be officially acknowledged. Apple basically got forced into certifying their OS after they claimed to be UNIX/POSIX but weren't, so mac OS is certified (except OSX 10.7, contrary to Apples marketing statements).

But also there exists original UNIX source code. Is mac OS original UNIX in that sense? Well, mac OS descends from two Operating Systems: BSD (mostly FreeBSD variant) and Mach, ths former definitely having historical UNIX heritage. But following lawsuites, there's no line of SystemV code anymore in FreeBSD and thus not in Darwin (the opensource UNIX part of mac OS). Hence, depending on the viewpoint ""pure code"", ""historical heritage"" and ""certification"", mac OS is UNIX or not.

Fun fact: There are systems with absolutely no historical inheritance of UNIX that are certified (z/OS).",1532560377.0
gorbash212,"Well on osx it comes down to whether you need the terminal or not.

Years ago, i always laughed how the ""just works"" os had appliance level configuration, with the advanced settings only accessible via command prompt. Really ironic that both mac and windows are fully fledged oses, but windows decided to build more into the gui, hence was ""harder to use"". Really? For a power user you just had to laugh, and thank fate for any years of experience you had with linux or proper unix.

These days its a bit different, apple settings with each new os are as detailed as windows... its certainly left the appliance days behind many years ago.

So there's bash available, and surprisingly the legacy non terminal based os scripting and automation are very powerful, enough to be appealing to the best of nerds.. 

Its a computer. The operating system abstracts the hardware like any other computer. Depends on what you need and what your preferred way of achieving it is. You don't have to use any osx progams that come with if you don't want to. Treat it like x it does that.

EDIT: If you want to, be completely terminal, you will have to learn the configuration infrastructure though. Its similar to nixes but the good stuff is all in apples own stuff ontop.",1532600717.0

cobalto_sfx,"If with ""*decrypting*"" you mean turning off FileVault full disk encryption, you can let the laptop to go to sleep without problems. As stated in its official support page: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837):

>Decryption occurs in the background as you use your Mac, and only while your Mac is awake and plugged in to AC power. You can check progress in the FileVault section of Security & Privacy preferences.

In your case, if the estimated time remaining in the GUI does not work. You can check the current status of the encryption/decryption through the Terminal.

To learn how to use the Terminal you can use the following official guide: [https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/access-the-shell-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/access-the-shell-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac)

There are several commands to view the current status of the disk encryption. Since you did not provide which macOS version is being used I will assume it is macOS High Sierra and the file system APFS.

Execute the following command to view the current encryption/decryption status:

`diskutil apfs list`

Since it is an APFS volume, the output is simple there is an Encryption Progress entry with a percentage as a value (e.g. 30%).

Additionally, the command:

`fdesetup status`

will also provide the decryption status.

The previous commands may require to be executed with sudo privileges on standard user accounts.",1532541913.0

Where to even start on all this nonsense ?

Reinstalling an app in OS X (starting with “uninstalling”) has accomplished nothing whatsoever and been necessary in reality perhaps once on my systems, once in all the years I’ve been using OS X since the Public Beta. A handful of times for clients due to Adobe apps and their garbage installers.


“I was a linux user” = no, not in any serious or even intermediate capacity. Not when you rant about having to use “obscure” command-line operations. What distro? Never once had to grapple with apt or rpm, package & version compatibility problems ?

I wouldn’t let any of those GUI toolz anywhere near a system that I cared about. Onyx? Please tell me you’re kidding : what do you do when it royally effs things up and you don’t understand what it did or how or why and you are unable to fix it ? Seen it happen more than once.

Actually learn an OS before ranting about it.

Calling for any kind of GUI tool when none is needed really appears little different from would-be Windows admins frothing at the mouth over being “forced” to use Powershell instead of being able to use only point-and-drool GUI all the time.

The basics of command line in OS X is pretty stock BSD UNIX which existed before linux was even in diapers.*

Trash the app. Set aside user-level prefs, global ones if there are any. Reset (killall) cfprefsd because of OS X’s aggressive preference caching. Or... log out and back in. Next ??

alllmossttherrre,"Partitioning is definitely the traditional way to test multiple systems on one Mac without needing an external drive. I've done it for years. It works great.

I have had trouble removing/merging partitions. I don't think this has anything to do with having run a beta system. It seems to be a general problem with Disk Utility and partitions. Although they say you're supposed to be able to repartition easily without having to erase and lose data, sometimes Disk Utility won't let me resize or delete some partitions unless I delete them, which means I back up the non-boot partitions then delete and add them again and restore the data. Big pain and takes time.

With High Sierra and Mojave, things are different, which I only found out when I started testing Mojave. It is no longer necessary to partition, thanks to the new APFS file system. When I tried to partition, Disk Utility said:

>**Apple File System Space Sharing**  
>  
>APFS volumes share storage space within a container, occupying a single partition. Adding and deleting APFS volumes is faster and simpler than editing a partition map.  
>  
>To add a new volume to a container without seeing this message, use the Add APFS Volume command in the Edit menu or the Add/Delete Volume toolbar item.

I decided to try the APFS volume (not partition). I made one and installed Mojave on it, and as far as I can tell it works as effectively as partitioning, in that macOS did not complain that I had two boot systems on one Mac. The APFS volume seemed to be just as good a wall between the systems.

What I do not know yet is, if I no longer need the Mojave volume, will it be any easier to delete the APFS volume than it was to delete a partition. That message above said it would be...but we'll find out later.",1532154295.0

nerpTV,"Both Windows and MacOS are at a point where clean installs are unnecessary. In fact, major OS upgrades, like going from Sierra to High Sierra, or going from Windows 1709 to 1803 are almost like a clean install in some ways. Windows, for example, basically installs the OS from a clean image and then migrates in your apps and settings during a version upgrade. 

In most cases, the only reason to do a clean install is if something important was corrupted or a wayward program mucked up the system. Or malware or something like that. 

I can appreciate someone wanting to do a clean install if they've installed and removed many apps and just want to clear out everything spread around all the system and hidden folders, even if it doesn't really affect performance and won't save a ton of disk space.

arob216,"I baked my own.

I manage dozens of Linux machines @work, some with complicated login routines.

To start, edit (or create) \~/.ssh/config file with entries for each host you connect to regularly, Each will look like:

  **Host REMOTEHOST**

  **Hostname 192.168.0.x (or FQDN)**

  **User root**

With this, just type **ssh REMOTEHOST** and you will connect and be prompted to login. Obviously, replace Hostname with the FQDN or IP of the host(s) you connect to and set Host to whatever ""friendly name"" you want to use to connect to each host. Repeat for all of the hosts you connect to regularly. If a machine has unique or deprecated hash algorithms, you can add additional lines under each Host such as **Ciphers 3des-cbc**. You can also set certain properties in this config file that apply to all hosts, or to each respective host, see man or do searches if you need to get down to this level.

Next, to avoid logins, use sshkeygen and ssh-copy-id (later requires homebrew or alternate workaround in newer MacOS versions where ssh-copy-id has been removed from the distribution). See this [link](https://www.jacobtomlinson.co.uk/2013/01/24/ssh-copy-id-os-x/) for some guidance. The idea is, you generate a public key for your local machine, copy it to the /.ssh/authorized-keys on the target machine and anytime you connect, the remote host will allow you in without prompting for a password. The benefit here is no passwords being sent over the network!

So, at this stage, you connect to your hosts using **ssh \[Host\]** and bypass the login prompt and get right to business.

Terminal or iTerm will use the \~/.ssh/config to complete the connections so instead of inputting the FQDN or IP Address, use the Host from the config file. In Terminal, click on New Remote Connection, select the host from the Server list (or add new ones if not already there), and you are done. ",1532097777.0

First, we will need some admin level permissions:

Open the policy file in your favorite editor (vi can be a bit tricky, so feel free to use something like TextEdit.app instead if you prefer):

    vi temp.xml

* Delete the entire the first line that says: `Getting global account policies` to make it valid xml
* Change the policy eg 4 characters down to 1 on the line: 

     `<string>policyAttributePassword matches '^$|.{1,}+'</string>`

     (e.g. change `{4,}` to `{1,}`)
* Save the changes

But you can’t just add a token to another user by editing directory attributes. The token is a cryptographic entity and it requires and existing token-holder to grant access to another account by using both their passwords. Meaning, if you want to grant token status to a user who doesn’t have it, you have to log in as the token-holder, and change the password on the non-token holder.

I’m pretty sure that mobile accounts can’t hold tokens as a limitation of the current system either, since their passwords can change externally from the system and there’s no clear answer for what that would mean for the token itself. Hopefully the story there gets better in Mojave.",1531509912.0

Usually these networks are setup to capture DNS queries in order to redirect users to their portal. Hence captive portals. The side effect is that our Mac probably has a lot of software trying to connect to various servers that are using https, but finds itself redirected to the captive portal which is also using https

However the portal’s certificate does not match the real servers’ certificates so a warning pops up.

wave-forms,"I keep hopping between just about every available client just to see what I like best. People don't think about it, but the amount of variables between clients is off the charts. Besides the interfaces and general behavior, there are significant differences in the way each client handles the formatting of email compositions, replies, quoting old messages, etc.

You could compose the same exact message in every client, and each message will look different when the recipient views it. Then there is a difference in the way it formats text for the user to read incoming emails, which may or may not be separate from the composition formatting.

For instance, Airmail seems to format emails with a larger left and top margin than other clients, so viewing emails sent via Airmail has those margins. It also has full line spacing between each bullet.

Spark forces nearly all text from every incoming email to look the same (font size and family), and composes messages in a larger than average font size (14). Spark also doesn't let you zoom text size or customize how big the text views (if it's too hard to read, which on high-resolution screens, it is).

macOS Mail has a strange quirk with bulleted lists where it doesn't show how the space between normal paragraph text and the bullets will look to the recipient. No extra lines before and after a bulleted list looks too tight when writing the email, but adding spacer lines causes the space to be way too large (two lines high) when reading in any client.",1533784813.0

We have an alternative to existing collaboration solutions and it has worked out very good for several teams.

Companies  are solving their email problems by by adding new messaging apps to  their tech stack. We’re making an end to this madness and partnered up  with email.

Loop organizes your email in  channels and enables you to collaborate with your team in real-time.  We’re not adding a new app to your tech stack - we’ve built THE ONE app  where you can get things done.

Here is how the Loop experience is different:

* you get to quickly see all emails and files exchanged with a contact in their respective channels
* you get to chat with people right next to your inbox
* you can share emails with colleagues and teams and have private chat discussions about them
* you can create team channels and store all team conversations in one place
* you can triage through unread emails and chat messages in our Loop Inbox

We also launched on Product Hunt today, you can find us here: [Loop Email - Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/loop-email), drop us some feedback there - is this something that would help your communication/collaboration problems?

But I'm posting just to say that when you are done, you are going to be SO HAPPY you did it. It is wonderful and miraculous to be able to call up any song I own at any time, and to freely make playlists of anything. The only gap is that I have not finished digitizing my vinyl and cassettes; I have all the hardware and software necessary, it is just a problem of available time since it's not a one-click operation like with CDs.

Also, after I ingested all my CDs, as I listened to tracks over the next year or so I made myself star-rate every track until they were all rated. The result of this is that now all my favorite songs are marked in the metadata, so it is easy to have iTunes auto-generate playlists that are guaranteed to not have any bad songs in them. Because the other side of rating every last song is that you can avoid listening to dud tracks, while still having them around if you want to listen to a complete album.",1531100135.0

I would recommend taking a look at Wix, SquareSpace and Weebly as these service provides seem to offer a great and simple to understand user interface for a price that is affordable by many - especially for small sites.

PussySmith,"Personally I wouldn’t buy the no touchbar 13. Thunderbolt 3 is great but 99% of the reasonably priced peripherals will be usb 3 or usb 3.1 with a type c connector.

There is one note that scares me:  
Note: Mac OS can only connect to 1 extended video display (or 2 mirrored displays) via this hub (Mac OS limitation). Windows PC can connect up to 2 extended displays via this hub. Only one memory card (either microSD or SD on a first come first serve basis) can be connected to the hub at any one time.

ycarel,"I would recommend the MAC as OS-X is a more dependable and gets out of your way much better.  
The specifications don't matter that much since both will work extremely fast and the difference is minor.  
The mac's also keep their value amazingly well so the actual cost of owning one will be lower.  
You don't need an expensive dock. Just get one multi AV dongle with charging port and another HDMI adapter. All in would be less than 100.  
In the end your effectiveness at work depends on the quality of the software, and how much it requires your attention for things not related to work.   
In my experience unless you have some IT department automating all the maintenance for you the OS-X is much more un-instrusive.",1530642401.0

In terms of “deep sleep,” if you have an SSD in your computer that’s called standby mode, so it’s normal for it to take a little longer to wake due to it storing your session data to the SSD. 

There’s also safe sleep, which will happen if your battery is at a low percentage, and will actually fully power your computer off. 

Something else to try if it’s particularly slow waking from deep sleep is to make sure the startup disk is set correctly in startup disk preferences:

SixtenJ,"Hey, 

In cases like this, it may help to reset your NVRAM & SMC (System Management Controller), which controls the different hardware systems in your Mac. At least that was helpful for me.
______________


NVRAM (this will reset sound volume, display resolution, startup disk selection, or time zone.):

Shut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option, Command, P, and R. You can release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart.

>On Mac computers that play a startup sound, you can release the keys after the second startup sound.

>On iMac Pro, you can release the keys after the Apple logo appears and disappears for the second time. 

***If your Mac is using a firmware password, this key combination does nothing or causes your Mac to start up from macOS Recovery. To reset NVRAM, first turn off the firmware password.***


SMC: 

1. Choose Apple menu > Shut Down.

2. After your Mac shuts down, press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the built-in keyboard, then press the power button at the same time. Hold these keys and the power button for 10 seconds.

3. Release all keys.

4. Press the power button again to turn on your Mac

Beerbaron23,"Back in the day everyone used OpenGL, then M$ decided to start their own 3D API Direct-X. For a very long time OpenGL out performed and looked better than Direct-3D (even on windows). That's where M$ decided to cripple OpenGL on windows which started to force dev's to use Direct-3D, Since windows has the largest customer base all the game developers wrote their games/engines in D3D. 

So when it comes to port the game over to OSX (if lucky) the majority of the time they use a middleware that translates the D3D calls into OpenGL so it can be displayed, but thats extra steps, hence worse performance. All because they don't want to pay the devs to port it properly.

Another reason is that many dev just use Wineskin (yes that right) straight up Wine/Winkskin/Winbottler to port their game over beacuse it's the cheapest way, but sadly it's full emulation and that's that.

Things might be changing as Metal is faster then D3D by a large margin and so is the new Vulkan API, but it's to get the devs to spend enough time writing their game in Metal or Vulkan when all the customers/$$$ is over on windows. But there will be a swing and I believe it will be Vulkan (since it runs on all major OS's and Mobiles) So dev's will be starting to code there games in Vulkan in the first place (so they can port there games everywhere with less hassel)

So in a nutshell it's due to economics, profitability and M$ using vendor lockin by giving the devs no other option but to use D3D on windows...

And faster gaming on OSX then windows certatinly can be possible. Take the Playstation 3 which runs BSD as an OS (very simular to OSX) and Sony Created the ""LibGCM API"" which gave devs very low level access to the GPU, devs were so amazed at the amount of performance they could get out of it, less restrictions and more creativity that pressure from devs to have something simular on the PC side of things. So that's when Metal and Vulkan were born to bring Sony's superior tech. Now all these newer low level API's are harder/more time consuming for the devs, so it will be a while before they learn all the tricks.

It's still a wait and see, as long as games are dev'ed on M$ first, they will get all the performance tweaks. But this instant if game was built ground up on the PS4, then ported to OSX properly (as there similar OS's and 3D api's) the game would run better on OSX then the port made to Windows.",1530021885.0

alllmossttherrre,"Does the Scaled button on either monitor show anything different if you Option-click it? On my 27"" non-4K monitor I get additional numerical resolutions. But Apple says what you get differs based on whether it's the primary or secondary monitor:

[https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25175](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25175?locale=en_US)

>why do they make it so hard to know what screen resolution you are using?!

Probably because there are three numbers now involved that Apple probably thinks would confuse users.

The old way is to list the resolution to which everything, UI and content, would be scaled. But now, for Retina/HiDPI/4K+ monitors, it is not useful for the casual end user to think in terms of the native resolution because things are not scaled like they were on older lower res monitors. (If they were, all text and UI would be too small.) It is about as useful for a user to care that they are on a 3180 x 2160 monitor as it is for a typical print reader to know that a page was printed at 2400 dpi vs 1200 dpi or whatever (they don't know and if it's sharp enough, they don't care).

Another way to see this is that the default experience of using a 3180 x 2160 monitor in terms of screen real estate is probably about the same in many cases as using a 1920 x 1080 monitor, because the UI has been scaled at 2x pixel density. Yes, all *content* is displayed at native panel resolution, but all *UI* is about the same apparent size as on 1920 x 1080 but 2x more detailed.

OK now look at what happened in that paragraph. There are three numbers in use: 3180 x 2160 (the panel resolution), 1920 x 1080 (the apparent UI resolution in pre-Retina terms that people are more familiar with but unlike the old days, is not the content display resolution because images and text are always displayed at panel native resolution regardless of the UI scaling), and 2x (the default Retina/HiDPI scaling factor). Not the one number we are used to setting. I think that is part of why Apple backed away from listing numbers. There are now too many numbers for the majority of the user base to figure out what to set.

I can understand how a 27"" 4K monitor might seem to have text and icons bigger than you expect, if its default experience is like 1920 x 1080, which is typically too low res for 27"" (when the display is not Retina) if you are used to working on 27"" monitors that are 2560 x 1440, like the one I'm typing on now.

But that is why Apple provides the options that let you make the UI smaller for ""more space"" for content, and at the other end ""larger text"" for people like the old lady I knew who set her 27"" (non-Retina) monitor to like 1024 x 768 because if it was any higher she couldn't read her emails.

I think there might be one more reason Apple hides the numbers. I read in an article that Apple has started providing scaling options that are not evenly divisible into the panel native resolution. This would absolutely horrify many ""power users"" and ""experts"", especially the ""old-timers"". They were all trained to always scale to an evenly divisible number because otherwise you would get unsightly jaggies due to rounding. That was true when your monitor was under 100 ppi. That is no longer a concern on Retina monitors because the resolution is high enough that you don't notice pixel grid rounding any more than you do looking at an image arbitrarily scaled on a 600 dpi printer. But if the numbers were shown a lot of ""old-timers"" would scream ""that is just wrong, never use that!""

Bottom line is that Apple probably decided that listing the numbers was less important to most users than listing the experience that a user wants out of their Retina display. Do they want to use the extra pixel density for more screen space, or do they want to enlarge the UI so they can read it? Those are the two primary motivations for changing the resolution, so that is the scale now in use.

Note: The above is all my speculation. I do not know why Apple did it the way they do, but based on what I know about Retina/HiDPI screens, the above makes a lot of sense to me.

I agree that Apple should make it easier for people who want to see the numbers anyway. If they put one number in there, it needs to have a clear and accurate label like ""UI apparent resolution as if 96 ppi"" since it will not change the content resolution. (But Apple probably tried to think through that and said ""screw it, people just want to know what's going to happen"")",1529923067.0

,"I’m pretty sure closing the lid absolutely makes it sleep. Those assertions can only keep it awake while the display is off and the lid is open, when it would normally sleep.",1529698000.0
alllmossttherrre,"In my experience, a Mac laptop will always force itself to sleep, unless there is a severe malfunction or a hung process.

Don't assume there is a problem if it is not sleeping immediately. In my years of experience using Mac laptops (since the PowerBook 160 in the early 1990s), I can tell you that there can be a delay of many seconds before a Mac goes to sleep after closing the lid. The delay can be caused by numerous factors, like a process that needs to put itself in a stable state before sleeping (like Time Machine cleaning up if it's in the middle of a backup), or simply copying the contents of RAM into the sleep image file on disk. In fact you will find that the more RAM a Mac has, the longer the delay until sleep.

But it will sleep eventually. macOS takes a strict approach against having the system continue to run while the lid is closed. The reason for this is plain. If a closed laptop is allowed to remain running and the user places the closed laptop inside a bag for immediate transport, the lack of airflow will cause the system to quickly reach dangerously high temperatures.

That is why [Apple only allows the laptop to stay awake on lid close if a keyboard, mouse, AC adapter, and external display are connected](https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201834), since that guarantees it is not being carried off in a bag.

That is also why the usual user question is not how to force it to sleep on lid close, but how to force it to stay awake on lid close, because Apple has designed it to force sleep as much as possible on lid close.

You should time how long it takes for the laptop to go to sleep. If it is a normally functioning Mac, it should sleep in anywhere from 10 to 60 seconds depending on age, CPU speed, disk speed, RAM amount, etc.

If it never goes to sleep even if you wait several minutes, something is wrong with macOS or the hardware and you need to start troubleshooting or reinstalling.",1529729835.0

Beerbaron23,"Not really, at least not in the same way it benefits windows.

Is it just a particular program causeing the lag, is it when you are doing something in particular?

Open up your Activity Monitor and start keeping track which running files are using the most of your CPU cycles whe it get laggy. Also check what kind of memory pressure you are usually at. While looking at your CPU usage take note if the files mds_stores, mds_worker and/or mds are using alot of your CPU% as in 15% each or more as there is a bug where these files will keep running in a continous loop after an update, thus slowing down your Macbook (there is an easy fix for it if it is)

Something as simple as running out of hard drive space will slow you down to a craw, make sure you have enough free space that is the same size of your ram (If you comp has 8GB ram, always be sure to have over 8GB's of hard disk space available).

Is the lag happen like when you are surfing/downloading from the internet or more from when you launch a program? or is it completely random or does it happen every minute like it's on a timer?


I have heard that cleaning up the storage and reinstalled the OS can boost up the performance. Is it true?

If you alrady had plenty of space free (like 40GB) freeing up and more space will not make any difference. Reinstalling the OS *might* on OSX (but guarenteed to work on windows), there is just such a small amount of things that can go wrong and not many places to make changes on OSX, as in you can clean it up manually by hand... the main important files that run the OS are completly protected by SIP, so the files don't get over written/moved/lost/renamed/updated or infected like they can in windows and there is no registey in OSX for that to happen as well.

coolpuddytat,"Time Machine worked so poorly for me that I decided to spend $50 on Carbon Copy Cloner instead.

It's a long story but basically Time Machine had been backing up tons of files that were already corrupted from my Macintosh HD to my backup drive (it doesn't seem to test the files before it copies them over). Eventually my HD died and I basically had no backup since all the files on my backup drive were also corrupted.

Thank goodness I had been syncing my priceless photos to Google Photos the whole time and had my work files backed up on Dropbox.

On someone's advice I downloaded a trial copy of Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) and ran it. The program immediately said that my backup files were corrupted. CCC does a check on your files to see if they are corrupted before it backs them up. It also allows you to create a bootable backup on your backup drive so basically you can boot to your Mac OS on your backup drive if your primary HD goes down.

It's been well worth the money. I now use it to back up to my NAS as well as to an internal HD that I stick into a HD dock once a week which I store off site.",1529560583.0

habgar,"If you have a spare computer and are thinking about trying it out just for kicks, go for it. But if the question is ""Should I switch my main computer that I do everything important on to Mojave Beta now?"", I have to ask, are you insane?

It has not been available long enough and tried by enough users for what could turn out to be potentially serious deficiencies to have been identified yet.

A reviewer at macperformanceguide blog just wrote a few weeks ago, after a huge security blunder involving passwords storage was reported with High Sierra and the new apfs file system:

*""MPG's recommendation must now be extended from the 6-month time frame: wait at least a YEAR before adopting any new macOS release. In other words, stay one macOS release behind.""*

Now, if you're not using your computer for work or major school projects, waiting a whole year might be a bit extreme for many. But I would wait at least until the first or second update is issued after the general release (not the beta!) before taking the plunge. And even then ONLY after making a complete backup of all your important files (ideally, backing up your entire system in case you need to revert).

I almost got burned back when El Capitan was released to the general public. Apple had made significant changes in how the USB system worked. There were a bunch of Mac owners frantically searching for help in the support forums of one of the major hard drive manufacturers because the users' external hard drives were no longer working after they had upgraded to El Capitan, which meant they had lost access to backups and, in some cases, to work projects. Fortunately, I had read the forums and decided to hold off on upgrading. It took over 6 months before the manufacturer came out with decent drivers, if I recall correctly. There are just too many manufacturers for whom macs are a poor stepchild; they direct most of their research into the Windows world and can be slow about getting decent, error-free drivers out with new macOS releases.",1530087942.0

All of our machines in our house are now 3-4 years old and they all run as good as the day we bought them without having to do any re-installs of the OS (Note: Exception is my Mac Mini which I wiped because I was running a Beta build which caused a sound issue I didn't want to deal with, but that comes with the territory).

The synchronization of my Safari tabs between my Macs, my iPhone, and my iPad is a feature I can't live without, the boot time is stupid fast, and in general if I think I should be able to do something within macOS, I've found I probably can without having to install any additional software. Adding a printer? There was no spending a bunch of time downloading drivers for it, I just went up to 'Add Printer' it located it on my network and everything was installed.

I'm also a big fan of iMessage being on there and it not randomly forcing a reboot of the entire system to do an update while I'm in the middle of doing something important. ",1529429321.0

azuredown,"I don't love MacOS. It's slow and buggy. But it is better than Windows. Here's why:

- Powerful search. Can search for lines of code and it will find the files with those lines for you.
- You can search menu items in the 'help' option. Very useful. Especially in things like image editors that have like a million options.
- Autosaving files.
- Apps start up automatically after a restart.
- Easy to install most applications (no setup process, just drag it into the application directory)
- True full screen. Not like Windows where the task bar is just hiding out on the side of the display.
- Much nicer font and nicer more consistent UI and no parts that look like they haven't been updated in years (device manager, task scheduler), Or at least I haven't seen anything like this on Mac OS. Some parts like the device info look sketchy but not nearly as bad.
- Default apps are much better.
- Can tag files. Small change but useful in some cases.
- In Windows sometimes the keyboard changes and I have to use ctrl+shift to change it back. I think it's related to me being in Canada or something.
- Windows had a problem where windows randomly resized themselves. Probably related to the window snapping feature
- Dragging a file into the file selector on Mac OS selects it instead of copying it.
- Picture in picture.
- Every Windows computer I've used slows down considerably after using it for a while. Especially after a cold boot. I've never used Windows with an SSD long enough to tell for sure if this is an issue but Mac doesn't do this.
- Wifi indicator is more accurate after waking from sleep (as in it doesn't say there's Wifi when there really isn't)
- Windows uses back slashes instead of forward slashes, 'dir' instead of 'ls', and also can not escape spaces in file names like Mac and Linux. I still don't know how space escaping works in Windows.
- Mac's version of UAC isn't as annoying as UAC on Windows (especially when the install bar stays at 0 forever and then UAC pops up and after it jumps to 100)
- Better touch tools (can't live without it and haven't found an alternative yet on Windows/Linux)... and other apps, I guess
- And it shuts down when I tell it.",1529434103.0

Overall, I prefer macOS for everyday use because of its relative simplicity. I enjoy the seamless experience as a user between my iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, and Apple TV.

DeepWebVault,"Being 100% honest, I only have a Hackintosh. Never had (except when the place I was working at used them) and never thought I'd want a mac, because I don't like Apple's overpriced products. It all started for a video using MacOS, showing people how to enter the Deep Web. Since I didn't, nor did my ""coworkers"" (<--friends) have a Mac, I had to get it on Virtualbox. I've never used a Mac in my life before that video so I had to put a lot of research into that. I originally hated my virtual Mac because it was really slow and the screen refresh rate on my VM is 15HZ. I started experimenting with it because my PC started fucking up a whole lot while working. I spent painful weeks with it but I slowly started falling for it. The sleek designs and amazing work put into it won my heart over. Now I'm contemplating to install MacOS onto my Lenovo Legion Y520, but I'm worried for a few reasons. 1. As far as I'm concerned, you can't get Vegas on Mac, which is one of the only video editing softwares I have ever used. 2. Even if I learn final cut pro, right now, even if we put all of our money together, we don't have 300$ to put into such a risky project as our YouTube channel, so I'd have to torrent FCP and I'm worried that Apple has anti-pirate detection. 3. I'm afraid something won't transfer well onto mac and I'll lose something important. 4. I do like a good video game and I'm afraid that something like Subnautica wouldn't run well on Mac.

So what I'm doing right now is I'm working my ass off, saving up money for an iMac so I can definitely play games if I ever have time to and I can work. Since my comment was so off-course, let me tell you what I actually love about MacOS.

***I've seen the good and the bad of both systems. Right now, I truly adore macOS because you can actually work with Apple Computers, unlike Windows PC-s. What I also adore is the BEAUTIFUL design of MacOS, something which Windows doesn't have right now. Macs all the way!***",1535664978.0

That Settings option (for others it is Settings > Users & Groups > Your Name > Login Items) is to hide the window after the app starts. It'll still show up in the dock since the app is running but you shouldn't see any windows open from that app.

Some people don't know this, but I don't think this is what you want, but you can right click on an app and go to Options and change if it should be opened at launch and if it should stay in the dock. If you want to clean up your dock from apps that you don't use, you can remove them so that it is less cluttered. You can also achieve this by dragging the icon off and holding it for a second till it gets a little ""Remove"" message above it. 

As for cleaning up the desktop itself, it is just a folder in Finder. You can move those icons around and organize them however you want so that it isn't cluttered with app icons. In fact, I'd recommend putting any Apps in the Application folder and not on your desktop (if that's what you have).

Open apps have to either show up in the Dock or in the toolbar (if the app supports that). So if you just want the dock cleaned up and have apps running in the background without the icon, that isn't possible.

Powerkey,"There is no Finder preference or utility (that I know of) that will do what you want. However, the reason this is happening is because the Finder window you are making the new folder in, does not have focus. In macOS, you are able to right click on something, a folder in your case, that does not have focus and the contextual menu will function the same. Unfortunately, the resulting folder, as you have discovered, does not have focus and does not automatically select for renaming.

The workaround is fairly simple. Simply click once, before the right-click, to bring the Finder window into focus first, and the right-click will functions as expected.

Alternatively, if you are going back and forth between LR and the Finder, <command-tab> can be used, instead of the first click, to give focus to the Finder window. This would allow you to the same procedure without using the mouse. In LR, <command-tab>, to bring the Finder window into focus, <command-shift-n> to create a new folder and rename, <command-tab> to go back to LR. No mouse required.

ThePowerOfDreams,Why are you installing a beta version of High Sierra? Just install 10.13.5.,1529137818.0
MewQuest,"It is bugged you have to time the shutdown just right. I upgraded two Mac Pro 5,1 with fresh installs of 10.13.4 and I am glad I never have to do that again. Hardest part is flashing that damn firmware. That the installer wants you to hold down the power button to flash the firmware is a cruel joke. The mac software engineers are laughing their behinds off. Between the two machines I had to try about 20 times each which is 20ish restarts and booting into the installer. But when that firmware finally flashes it is a huge relief. You'll never have to do that **** ever again. It's all about timing.

My advice(How I did it)[This was for a usb install of High Sierra 10.13.4 on a Mac Pro 5,1]:
So when the dialogue box for firmware update comes up hit the shutdown button. You will know you have hit it and it did something because the spinning beach ball will come up for about 3-5 seconds. If no beach ball, restart and try again. I always got beach ball tho. After the beach ball is gone you go hold down the power button to force shut off the mac. When it turns off you can release the power button. Now this is were timing is critical, hold down the power button to boot up the mac. Don't let go until you hear certain sounds(I forget the sound they from the mac's internal speaker). It has been awhile but I remember the first beep sound is a trap, don't let go of the power button. You have to wait till you hear a second different beep and then you let go of the power button. If you timed it right it will flash a different sort of white screen with an apple logo and progress bar that is a little bigger than the normal one you would see. This is the firmware flashing screen it will flash the firmware now. If you didn't time it exactly right it will just boot like normal as if those horrible beeps of death meant nothing. And you'll just have to boot the installer and try try again.

Before the flashing process I reset both the SMC and NVRAM on the Mac Pro's. I also removed any hard drives so it wouldn't boot from one or waste time trying too. O and always leave the installer usb drive in till process is done, just to be safe.",1529174263.0

MewQuest,"It has to do with Metal API they updated it to what they call the 2nd gen. Metal requires at least an Intel HD and Iris Graphics from the HD 4000 series or newer, an AMD GCN-based GPU, or a Nvidia Kepler-based GPU or newer.

I looked into why they have those requirements. It has to do with low-level and low-overhead support by the graphics.

For the intel graphics it comes down to the fact that the intel hd 3000 is a directx 10.1 card while the intel hd 4000 was originally a directx 11 card but I believe it has had some ""patches"" allowing it to support Metal.

For the AMD ""GCN"" it is a architecture that debuted back in 2012 with the release of the Radeon HD 7000's series. This was a massive improvement over the previous ""Terrascale"" architecture. ""GCN"" ushered in the Mantle API which would not gain significant ground and would be axed by AMD but it would lay the groundwork for the Khronos Group to create the Vulkan API which is essentially a fork of the Mantle API and its' unofficial successor. Metal functions in a way somewhat like Vulkan in that it is designed to have low-overhead and get the graphics work done without much interaction from the OS. Anyways the Radeon HD 6000 series cards are based on ""Terascale"" and have no way to communicate with the low-level, low-overhead Metal API, just as they could not communicate with Mantle or Vulkan.

For the Nvidia ""Kepler"" architecture the story is the same, but less lengthy. Support for Direct3D 12 feature level 11_0 was added. Which allows low-level, low-overhead Metal to communicate with them. Fermi the previous architecture did not have this natively and it was recently ""patched"" to have feature 11. Still it still doesn't preform as well as the Kepler or newer architecture in the area of low-level communication.

TL;DR   Your graphics cards in your 2011 MBP cannot communicate with Metal API. It relies on a middleman more often, the CPU. This is inefficient and a waste of time and resources. Metal doesn't even bother trying to figure out where your gpu is spewing out commands. It just wants to communicate with the gpu one-on-one without the middleman. In High Sierra and before Apple allowed OpenGL to be used instead of Metal to render graphics. OpenGL has been around awhile and is supported by every card made for a pci-e slot. Apparently OpenGL will no longer be allowed to render the GUI.",1529172251.0

sfsdfd,"I have a similar late-2011 MBP. I've had to stop using it because the logic board has failed, due to a long-known graphics defect, and they want $700 to replace it.

This is really a shame, because the rest of the components are still fully usable. I 100% specced it out when I bought it, and have upgraded it since then with an SSD and better memory. Alas, it's dead.

Like you, I wonder about dropped support, and I don't buy the official explanations. Just as you stated, I believe that the only hardware component that lacks key features for more recent versions of MacOS is the Bluetooth adapter, but I'm fully willing to forgo those features.

I think that the termination of support is about pushing new MBPs out the door. And I'm absolutely not buying one now. My 2011 MBP has MagSafe, physical function keys and a physical Escape key, integrated Ethernet, integrated USB-A ports, and a headphones jack. I'm not willing to give up all of that stuff just because ""courage"" or some shit like that.

AmokinKS,"My brothers 2010 13"" mbp was running 10.8.x and I dove in and did the High Sierra update. He had an SSD installed, but it took _hours_. I was surprised it worked. Several reboots, a couple of firmware updates, we did it from the app store, but it did the whole shebang.

I've had other machines that I've tried to update directly to High Sierra from usb drive and it will bork up, usually because there is an intermittent firmware update that is needed. So my plan B that has worked is update them to Sierra, and then to High Sierra.

I understand Apple's reasoning in making this change but I have yet to have it be beneficial and I don't recall seeing many positive responses to it online.

MrStarktastic,"People here have already mentioned BetterTouchTool so I don't have to.
Other than that, it's great for programming and especially those who don't use just one IDE all the time (XCode, VS Code and Android Studio. I had to use BTT to implement my own set of buttons for the latter one). That is, I don't have to remember the plethora of different shortcuts. With time, I actually realized how much easier it is to just tap a button on the touchbar instead of combining 2-3 keys on my keyboard. Tap to rename, tap to duplicate line, tap to run command, tap to peek definition, tap to show references, etc.
Another thing I can vouch for is Photoshop. Changing the brush size, opacity and toggling mask modes with the touchbar is just a bliss.
You also have the screenshot button which I like a lot. It's just so much simpler and quicker to take a screenshot with it while conveniently setting the type of screenshot (selection/window/entire screen) and selecting the desired destination.
Quicktype suggestions are wonderful as well. In fact, This very comment had a few typos avoided thanks to that feature.

While the next iteration of macOS let say 10.15, most 2012 devices might probably still be getting it unless Apple change the standard again.

That's the quirks being in the ecosystem. You gotta stay up\-to\-date in both hardware and software or else you'll be left behind.

anazhd,"I think differently. Probably this is not that much of a memory leak. From my previous experience on various OS from Windows to Arm Linux this can be considered normal as extra monitor means extra pixels rendering, which uses more vram. Noticeable on weaker and lower vram graphic processing unit. For an instance, my 2017 MBP 13\-inch with Intel Iris Plus 640 will stutter quite a bit with my FHD monitor hooked. That's with 1536mb **shared vram**. Same thing happening to my old gaming rig with Radeon R7 370 2048mb dedicated vram. Having higher or dedicated (dGPU) vram is better for multiple monitor setup plus you might need better graphic processing unit as iGPU can't handle one too many pixels.  


Notice that I bolded that shared vram abobe?

> In computer architecture, **shared graphics memory** refers to a design where the graphics chip does not have its own dedicated memory, and instead shares the main system RAM with the CPU and other components.

- You can search menu items in the 'help' option. Very useful. Especially in things like image editors that have like a million options.
- Autosaving files.
- Apps start up automatically after a restart.
- Easy to install most applications (no setup process, just drag it into the application directory)
- True full screen. Not like Windows where the task bar is just hiding out on the side of the display.
- Much nicer font and nicer more consistent UI and no parts that look like they haven't been updated in years (device manager, task scheduler), Or at least I haven't seen anything like this on Mac OS. Some parts like the device info look sketchy but not nearly as bad.
- Default apps are much better.
- Can tag files. Small change but useful in some cases.
- In Windows sometimes the keyboard changes and I have to use ctrl+shift to change it back. I think it's related to me being in Canada or something.
- Mac's version of UAC isn't as annoying as UAC on Windows (especially when the install bar stays at 0 forever and then UAC pops up and after it jumps to 100)
- Dragging a file into the file selector on Mac OS selects it instead of copying it.
- Picture in picture. It just works (as long as you're willing to double right click on a YouTube video and use Safari).
- Wifi indicator is more accurate after waking from sleep (as in it doesn't say there's Wifi when there really isn't)
- Windows uses back slashes instead of forward slashes, 'dir' instead of 'ls', and also can not escape spaces in file names like Mac and Linux. I still don't know how space escaping works in Windows.
- Better touch tools (can't live without it and haven't found an alternative yet on Windows/Linux)... and other apps, I guess
- And it shuts down when I tell it to.

zankky,"While I agree with you in principle,there are three important things to consider: 

1) people will always install betas and they will always ask questions when it doesnt work. When you build a product this exciting or with such reveals you will have people that want to get aboard and try it to check it out. And when it breaks yes they will ask for help.

2) while yes it does have a strictly beta badge, I believe it is now public beta as per Apple (I’m not sure though, maybe it’s a dev only preview now with public beta later?). That means Apple wants the public to use it and thus they don’t have to be a non dev

3) we should be excited there are so many people willing to take the risk with beta software. Speaks to the power of the platform and who knows how many new developers might come out of these betas who are inspired to build something, and also lots of people with lots of bugs means lots of fixes available for any issues after a public release.

theultimatething,"Even if you don't think you need the Touch Bar, the Touch Bar model has its benefits: it has 4 usb-c ports instead of 2, two fans instead of one, a slightly better graphics card (650 vs 640), three microphones instead of two, Touch ID (which is actually very cool for unlocking the MacBook). The Touch Bar model also has a better powered CPU (28W versus 15W). Although the performance gap between the 15W and 28W CPUs these days is small, the gap between the Iris Plus 640 and 650 is a tiny bit bigger if graphics performance matters to you.

With all that being said, the battery life on the non-Touch Bar is meant to be better because of the slightly higher capacity (54.5 vs 49.2 watt-hour)

It all depends on what matters most to you at the end of the day. If you don't mind the compromises, and if a 2.3GHz i5 is enough for you, the non-Touch Bar model is definitely cheaper and better value.",1528426393.0

I currently run Indesign, Illustrator and Photoshop simultaneously. No annoyances except if you work in a warm environment, machine might start breathing heavily sooner than expected. But can easily calm down.

I do browser editing for WordPress and Wix through Chrome which are ram intensive too. But I can easily manage.

I constantly run a dual screen setup with an external monitor through a USB hub coz I don't have a USB-c to c hdmi cable. 

I'm not trying to say this is so damn good. I am annoyed about the usb-c dongles but apparently that's the future. And I have to carry my portable hard drive with my music library coz I don't want to clog up the small ssd. Oh and the butterfly keys get stuck sometimes but and upside down tap helps it to jump back in place. 

But I'm blown away by the portability, the battery life, screen quality and the amount of power this little thing has. It does glitch or slow down a bit if I have my design software running along with Parallels with Windows 10. It must be due to the Ram limitation.

Overall, if you're on a budget and you absolutely need a mac, like me, go for it. You won't regret it. Save the money for an awesome USB-c hub that doesn't interfere with 2.4 WiFi (don't get the apple one). And also external keyboard & mouse, or even external monitor if that's your thing.

**1)** Check your memory. You might not have enough to run it.

**2)** You might have needed to do a fresh install when you did an in\-place install. I did a fresh install instead of just installing over High Sierra because I had a feeling something like that was going to happen if I didn't.

**3)** How is your hardware? Have you ever replaced the battery? If you haven't, you might wanna see about it (it's past it's due) as this could be a cause too.

**4)** Check if it is doing this in safe mode. I should have put this as number 1, but oh well. If it is NOT doing it in safe mode, then you likely have a problem with YOUR files/apps causing problems on startup.",1528258434.0

""\*\*June 4, 2018 conclusions:\*\*We \(dosdude1 & parrotgeek1\) have thoroughly investigated 10.14 GPU drivers, and sadly, we have concluded that ***it is not possible for any non\-Metal GPU to work, because almost the entire OS uses Metal.***

**Evidence for this:** If you remove the Metal driver, it won't boot. But if you remove the OpenGL driver, it boots *with acceleration* but random actions throughout the OS cause crashes. Also, removing the OpenGL software renderer doesn't break safe mode, so it must use a non\-OpenGL software renderer.""

I was able to install (update to) Mojave following below procedures.

First you must back up everything just in case of failure.

1. make a clone backup on a bootable HD (this HD has to be a single HD, not raid) using [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/download) 
2. shut down main raid 0 macintosh and startup the clone bootable HD
3. update high sierra to Mojave on the clone bootable HD
4. Once the update is done, open disk utility. choose the raid HD and delete the raid.
5. while opening disk utility, open Raid assistant from file
6. Create Mac OS Extended (journaled) based Raid disk
7. open  [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/download) and clone the updated bootable HD to the new raid disk
8. Once it's done. you should be able to boot the new raid disk which has Mojave MacOS

MrGonz,"You can use Disk Utility. Using restore, the old drive as the source and the new drive as the target. Make sure to format the new drive properly before hand. 

This creates a block copy. I don’t personally use this as a method to copy a boot drive. I usually only do this if there is security concern or some other audit is needed and the drive must be in read-only. Windows users use this method because of the registry and it’s crappy hives. 

If you want to pay money for a disk utility tool, I suggest Carbon Copy Cloner. You can setup cron jobs and event triggers with CCC. 

I wouldn’t do this to migrate a users data and profile. I would format the new drive, install the OS, update and migrate the user. If you can’t do that, there is likely something wrong that probably should be addressed. The other method would just copy the mistakes. 

Also, the second method is generally faster but that depends on what tools you have to play with at your bench. Availability of high speed cradles, local Apple Update repo etc. make this a simple task. 

Ironically, I despise big boot drives and push all my clients to as small a drive as they can handle. Keep that data off your boot drive. Not doing so invites disaster. I’d turn that big drive into a Time Machine and get a handle on the data management. Which is easy to do when you have resources to support you to that end not so easy as an individual. 

Best of luck!

77ilham77,"Really? I'm using 15"" 2014 MBP with 750m, and I don't have any graphic issues at all. In fact, after High Sierra, desktop animations (like mission control, dock's folders, and such) felt more smoother than Sierra.

The only graphic issue that I have is iTunes (but then again, it's just iTunes being iTunes). Since HS animation such as expanding/opening an album is choppy (sometimes I only see like 2-3 frames of the animation), but that's only happen when the MBP is on Intel iGPU. When the 750m kicks in (like when my MBP is on clamshell mode connected to external display, or I have graphic-intensive apps/games on the background) then the animation becomes smooth.",1528124911.0

In my case, btw, it only happens when a second monitor is attached. There's plenty of info about this on forums, anyway. It's most noticed on Mac Pros, because pro environments often includes multiple monitors. But affects any mac with a dedicated GPU, for what it seems.  


Suggestion for you: If you have any issue, post a bug report via Apple's website. If it comes as a dupe, it will, at least, tell you if that dupe is still on progress of being fixed, or they already closed it. ",1528151913.0
intransient,"Glad to have found this and other threads just before I pushed the trigger on HS on my maxed out Mid\-2014/750m.

On one hand, I have a GTX 1070 eGPU in a TB2 enclosure, and I'd love to get it working properly with [this package](https://github.com/mayankk2308/purge-wrangler) on 10.13. Nvidia web drivers on 10.12 are pretty kernel panicky.

On the other hand, it sounds like my two external monitors would get bogged down something fierce in 10.13 without the eGPU. Not to mention folks still seem to have stability issues with the web drivers in 10.13 anyways?

Sounds like the safest bet is to stay away from Nvidia on Macs. That really sucks. Is Apple really up for supporting GPUs other than their newest OEM provider or not?",1528853255.0

MrGonz,"Don’t use CleanMyMac. Or MacKeeper. That’s PUA/Malware. Jeez can’t we get a sticky on these garbage apps (with removal instructions)?!?

There is probably nothing you can do if aren’t familiar with *nix computers. All you’d be able to accomplish is blowing out kruft. Which is likely not doing anything anyways. You’d be lucky to find a total of 5-6 GB of files you could throw away. And that would mean dumping caches and sleepimage. So its not like that’s typically a good thing to do. But all this is dangerous if you don’t know what files have dependencies. Very low pay off, high risk. 

I wouldn’t update to High Sierra on that old of a machine. You could get away with Sierra if you have a copy.  Likely, the OS will run slower in the best case scenario. 

You can run Adobe CS4 or later on Sierra/High Sierra but again, you’d need to either do an inplace upgrade or be familiar with deprecated Java and Carbon frameworks to install missing components. Further you’d need to know how to do it. Ive had to figure out save crashes and kernel panics with standard tasks like rearranging layers on CS4 and Yosemite. Not a lot of fun. If Creative Cloud, no issues. 

Quark I am not familiar with currently since I don’t have any clients using it. 

Otherwise, i agree with what others have said about improving the hardware with RAM and an SSD. Easy peasy if a Macbook, a test of meddle if an iMac. 

That said, throwing money and effort into this old of a Mac is probably not wise. If they authoring digital media (as the app list hints), they are doing the entire production pipeline a disservice by not authoring in 64-bit apps, incomplete DOMs, deprecated tools. 

Good luck!",1528142173.0

SchrodingerCoolGuy,"You seriously don't need any anti-virus on your Mac, it will just hog up resources. I should also mention that Mac OS has a built-in ""Anti-Malware"" program, called XProtect, that runs/updates under the hood on your Mac (even if it probably isn't as good as a frequently updated AV-program). 


Furthermore, there are some ""security things"" that you should have turned on:

1. Turn on the firewall (which is turned off as standard). This is done by going to: Settings -> Security and Integrity -> Firewall. Press ""Activate firewall"". Moreover, in the Firewall settings, activate ""Stealth Mode"" by marking/checking the box in the settings"".

2. Turn on FileVault by following the same procedure as earlier, but this time got to ""FileVault"" instead of ""Firewall"". Just press activate (might take some time if you have a lot of things on your hard drive).

3. ""Common sense"": Don't download things, install things, or enter your admin password, if you aren't completely sure that what you are about to do is ""safe"" (even if it can be difficult to differ between ""what's safe"" and ""what's not safe"").

Ways to get around this limitation:

* Don't run those images on your Mac, rather host them on the cloud using a service such as AWS or Azure. Connect using Remote Desktop. This options cost a couple of $ per month, but has some inherent advantages such as being able to share with team, 24x7 always on, backup in case of laptop loss etc.
* Run those windows instances on another dedicated server on your local network, and connect using Remote Desktop from your MacBook. For example, I have a nice [Intel Xeon D-1518](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0VTV3E/) running headless in my basement, and a pfSense VPN appliance that allows me to connect from remote locations. Disadvantage is that you have to buy the hardware and set it up, but once done the only cost is electricity, and virtualization software.
* Do you actually really need those heavy Windows virtual machines? Are there alternatives such as [Docker images](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) that can do the same job with a lot less operating system overhead? Eg. instead of running a LAMP stack on Windows, run it on a Linux based Docker image? You might be able to squeeze into 16GB with a bit of housekeeping.",1527723052.0

Luckily this is a cheap and quick fix, but still, from all apples' previous flex cable history lessons this shouldn't have happened at all.

2016 and 2017 MBPs are plagued by the keyboard issues and Macbook Airs \(from 2013 to current\) just tend to randomly die for no reason at all.

[See here a testimony from a Wikipedia editor on the Li-Ion battery page on why they blacklisted Buchmann's site as source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3ALithium-ion_battery#batteryuniversity.com). Even the claim ""keeping a laptop plugged in while 100%"" is the most dumbest thing I've ever heard. If this is even remotely true, than millions of li-ion devices will combust into flame right now.

While it's true if you overcharge a li-ion battery will destroy it, this will only happens if the battery or the charger doesn't have any sort of power management. I believe every manufacturer (including Apple) isn't dumb enough to not know this, and that's why there is this thing called Power Management Unit (or on Macbook is widely known as System Management Control). Also with the help of this PMU they can came up with this thing called ""Trickle Charge"". Do you ever think why every electronic device with rechargeable lithium battery charge very slow after 80-90%? With this technique the manufacturer can prolong the battery life, by ""cooling down"" the battery after heavy charge and, obviously, to prevent overcharge.

Apart from ""trickle charge"", Apple also implement a technique where the Macbook (after fully charged) will automatically switch its power supply to AC adapter (thus letting the battery stand by). If you ever used a Macbook (AFAIK) before OS X Yosemite (or maybe way before that), you will notice when the battery fully charged, the icon will turn into ""AC plug"" i.e. it's taking the AC power instead of the battery. Or if you use Windows XP on Bootcamp, you will notice it ""freaks out"" after 100% thinking the user detach the battery, while in reality the SMC just switch the power supply to AC plug. Many laptop manufacturer these days have followed Apple on their PMU design by including this technique.

And that's why it is in the interest of the users for keeping their Macbook plugged in while 100% since the battery will rarely used, thus prolonging its life. Apart from this, the most important thing when it comes to protecting your battery life is the environment. You should always keep your battery (the Macbook) in cool place wether you're charging it or not. I can't say ""oh, just keep your Macbook plugged in every time"" because, hey, it's a laptop. Don't be afraid if you're a road warrior and rarely found a place to charge your Macbook. Wear and tear is inevitable. We can't say ""don't drive your car because it will shortened its tyre lifespan"" because it doesn't make sense, right?

tl;dr: manufacturer like Apple isn't dumb enough to not know how to handle their battery life, so just continue use your Macbook as usual.

edit: I also forgot to mention that by following the app's suggestion (by not charging over 80-90%), you're preventing the PMU/SMC to trickle charge the battery, where the PMU also recalibrate the battery. By keeping under 80-90%, you're constantly blasting the battery with high voltage on and off (plugged and unplugged) since below 80-90% (I forget where Apple put the trickle charge starting point is) is a fully powered charge. And not to mention preventing the PMU to know where is the true ""100%"" mark of the battery.",1527088176.0
jocamero,Or... just use the built in charging on macOS and don't over complicate your life.  My 4 year old battery on my rMBP still has 89% of it's capacity after 282 charge cycles and I regularly leave it plugged in.,1527021087.0

The linked page links to [batteryuniversity.com](https://batteryuniversity.com) which I think is credible.

I am typing on a 6 yr old MacBook Pro still on its original battery, with health still around 80&#37; even though it is over 1100 cycles. And my 1.5 yr old iPhone is at near 100&#37; health.

One of the benefits of this type of strategy is avoiding the life\-shortening combination of long hours at near\-100&#37; charge and high temperature, if your Mac gets driven hard.

I'm aware of how lithium ion batteries work and how to prolong their life but a small assistant like this to remind you of how you should is great especially when you charge/discharge it often.

As for macOS handling this for you, this is both true and untrue.
Sure it won't keep topping the battery on the charger, but that doesn't mean it will keep the battery from degrading faster due to being charged almost fully.

If Command\-space doesn't work, there may be a conflicting keyboard shortcut. For example, a lot of Adobe apps use Command\-space to get the zoom tool.

Many years ago I changed the Spotlight shortcut to a function key so that I would only have to hit one key that didn't conflict with anything else. You do this by going into System Preferences, Keyboard, click Shortcuts tab, click Spotlight, edit shortcut to whatever you want.

For window management I use Moom, but there are others being mentioned here too which are good, it is largely personal preference.

General tip: If you are sure what you want to do is not already built into macOS, then look for a utility that will do it. There are two places to look for good Mac software. One is the Mac App Store of course, but not everything is in there. Some applications are simply not sold through the Mac App Store, and others do power\-user things that may not be allowed in App Store apps. For the software not available through the App Store, try [macupdate.com](https://macupdate.com).

I am surprised about the long login time. I have an old 2011 MacBook Pro and it doesn't seem like it takes that long. If we are really talking about login \(not merely authenticating on wake into an account that's already logged in\), then you could check to see if there are any login items that are holding up the show. Go to System Preferences, Users and Groups, select your account, click the Login Items tab. If there is anything there that should not be there or looks suspicious, maybe it's slowing down login?

Maybe check the Console app to see if there are any error messages during login?",1527020978.0
itchy_cat,"Your first three points have nothing to do with OS X and I can't relate as I have a 2015 model which has a smaller trackpad, actual function keys and the old scissor keyboard, but some people seem to agree that it's a matter of getting used to. In any case, this is hardware, nothing you can fix without actually getting another machine.

As for the other, the login issue does sound abnormal, but I'm not sure if you mean a cold boot or just waking up your Mac. If you can clear that up it would be a little easier to point you in some direction. Mind that if your disk is encrypted, either process will take a little longer.

Window management on OS X is very different from Windows \(and most Linux DEs as most work essentially like Windows\) and I can understand that it probably looks messier and more archaic for anyone new to Macs. I'm used to it so I can't say it doesn't make sense, but there's plenty of tools already suggested that can help you on that front. Anyway, try to get familiar with the trackpad gestures and keyboard shortcuts for Mission Control and general window management, it will help a lot.

What I can give a little input into is the Spotlight shortcut. It's Command \+ Space by default and it has always been \(although you can change it on the Keyboard pref pane in System Preferences, but not to one key only\) and it's so that it's harder to activate by accident. I'm sure you know what it's like to hit the Windows key by accident and having the menu steal the focus and get in the way oh what you were doing, that's not supposed to happen on OS X with Spotlight and that's why it's two keys. Why Cmd \+ Space and not something else? I don't really know, but it works very well for me and it's unequivocal. One of the major upsides to OS X, though, is that you can add and/or change pretty much any shortcut you want system\-wide very easily and with very little restrictions; just look into the Shortcuts tab in the Keyboard pref pane. Other than the ones that already exist, if you can access it through a menu, you can have a shortcut for it, no matter what.",1527031901.0

the built-in method uses the full screen spaces in mission control.  you can drag two apps together to put two side-by-side.

50shadesofnerdy,"As someone who switched from Windows to a 2016 MBP, here's my part.

I was struggling with the accidental touch bar presses as well. I used BetterTouchTool to set it up to my liking, but eventually I have gotten comfortable and these accidental presses don't happen anymore. Did take 2-3 months of getting used to, but now it's fine.

On daily basis, I use second screen and Magic Keyboard for some stuff, which is much better, however I can work with the internal one too. Not sure how it would be for long texts though. Trackpad hasn't been an issue for me at all.

Boot time is abnormal, something wrong there. If you want more powerful search, you can use Alfred and configure alternative shortcut there, however you can't really get it to be single button for usability reasons, I'm afraid.

For window management, look into Spectacle. Only basic split screen exists in the OS. I personally just set up some keyboard shortcuts to move window to left half/right half. As a advanced sysadmin, I prefer using keyboard shortcuts over mouse. ",1527026192.0

You want to start from the vBox 'Boot Maintenance Manager' 
To my best memory you get there from your Shell> prompt by typing 'exit' (where your screen shot shows Fs0:).

Then choose Boot from File.  Here you need to find that file first.  Try drilling down in the dir (maybe that dir is ""Install macOS High Sierra.app"" - not sure).  It's been quite some time since I did this and my notes are vague.

You are looking for boot.efi
I found that in ""locked files"" but don't recall the full path.  Once you know it's path you can see if boot from file will do it for you.

You may want to check the Applications folder for applications you have removed \(you can remove the data if you don't need it or don't intend to reinstall\). Hidden files and directories are also used in the home directory to save data, but those files are usually less than 10 kilobytes and some less than 1000 bytes.

>Since the 2017 Apple World Wide Developers Conference, it’s been well-known that Apple will require all developers to submit only 64-bit apps to the Mac App Store. Starting on June 4, 2018, all Mac apps and updates to existing apps must support 64-bit mode. While most casual Mac users may not see a difference in day-to-day work, those who are advanced Mac users or system administrators may wish to know what apps could need updating. One easy way to do this is to set up a Mac running macOS 10.13.4 High Sierra or later in 64-bit mode to see what’s compatible and what isn’t. This Mac tip can be used to enable 64-bit mode on a Mac for testing, then shift back to the ability to run 32-bit apps and other software components.

Last year a buddy of mine who has been a network engineer for almost 30 years went to a seminar put on by Watchguard (firewall vendor). In their presentation they said that they’ve seen instances of the usb drives coming out of China that have firmware that waits until the computer is idle and then installs Trojans, malware or backdoors. But it specifically waits until idle so as to not alert the user that something is going on. Their advice was to never leave thumb drives plugged in. 

After he gets back from event he tells me about this. I find it fascinating and ask questions. They didn’t get into how it works technically because the main focus was about how their firewalls protect against this stuff, but thinking about how a usb drive could do things on a computer, it could present to the machine as a keyboard and then mimic key strokes. There are already examples of this with cheap usb drives that vendors give away at conferences that when you plug them in they open a browser and go to the vendors website.

Before even getting anti-virus I think the best approach is hardening your setup with these steps (the first 4 will pretty much protect from 99% of exploits):

- setup a non-admin Mac OS account and use it as your normal account
- make sure your browsers are up to date
- always install the latest Mac OS patches
- only install apps from the app store

- if you download apps from outside the app store, then scan them with an anti-virus, check the app's checksum (if provided by the developer), and if possible have a quarrantine period after you download before you install them (to avoid getting hit by a zero day exploit not yet covered by anti-virus)
- keep an archive of software you downloaded and rescan it occasionally

With the approach above I find it's better to just have a manual anti-virus app available, rather than continuous scan apps which can introduce issues of their own, and in some cases could actually be exploitable themselves.

Hope that helps.

dig deeper. or at least look in the *obvious* places to look (i.e. keyboard system preferences).

ctrl + space is a global shortcut for cycling through input sources. of course these global defaults are COMPLETELY configurable through system preferences (under the shortcuts tab). unlike Windows you have complete freedom to create per application and global hotkeys/shortcuts. basically anything that has a menu item can be mapped to a hotkey. this is EXTREMELY powerful.

That's fine to do for most normal apps. You shouldn't be spending time micro managing processes on macOS any more than you should on iOS.

The apps are expected to manage resources efficiently, and macOS also has several built in tools for further managing each app's resource use \(eg App Nap and Sudden Termination\).

Explicitly quitting apps on macOS is something you shouldn't bother doing unless you're running on battery and need to eke out the battery life as long as possible. In which case you should check the Energy tab in Activity Monitor, and look for which apps have been consuming the most energy.

The one big exception to this rule is anything made by Adobe. If it's an Adobe app, kill that shit. Adobe apps are energy and memory use cancer, and are actively putting effort into being the least well mannered apps on your computer.

Edit: App Nap is a bit like iOS's suspended state for apps that are in the background. And Sudden Termination is \(I think\) a flag that lets macOS know that it's ok for macOS to kill the app at any time it wants. So those two make macOS vaguely similar to iOS in terms of energy management. Although on macOS they're opt in, where as on iOS they're opt out. So they rely on app makers opting in. ",1525481758.0
PhotonPixel,"I cant give you a real answer to your question but I would like to point out something. This statement has something true, but as an absolute statement is just false. Yes, an App that does nothing will be handled nice in iOS, but if your App actually does work you should definitely quit it.

If I run some fancy GPS tracker on iOS or any other thing which actually does something, it will probably use more power than closing it. I can empty my iPhone in 2-3 hours by playing pokemon go in the background while connected to a bluetooth accessory (without real me doing anything). If I quit it it will hold out just nice. As you cant generalize what an app does in the background, you cant generalize if you should quit an app or not. You cant just assume that every app does nothing in background and is therefore handled perfectly by the OS. And the same is true for macOS.

I can for sure tell that having Lightroom open in background decreases battery life. But this could be alone because I have a 15 inch macbook pro and it switches to the AMD graphics card when lightroom is open. On the other hand Safari, Mail and basic text edit tools appear to be handled quite good.

I think the idea of telling people to not close apps on your phone is to stop people from quitting all apps every hour or so.

In a lot of everyday usage and multimedia I can’t imagine anything really putting this MacBook through it’s paces. It’s pretty much latest gen and it’ll last you a good while barring any hardware malfunctions.

If anything the only hurdle you’ll be facing is acclimating to the new operating system, which will take almost no time at all because OSX really ain’t all that different from Windows. 

If security is a priority for you, I’d do as the other user suggested and wipe the system clean and start from scratch and while doing this to also enable FileVault and have the entire hard disk / SSD encrypted. It’s a bit of a pain if you enable it in a system that’s already been used and loaded with files, bt it’ll be a snap with a newly refreshed operating system.

As for basic security like viruses, don’t worry too much. Things like automatically loading .exe’s can’t really happen because there are no executable files on OSX. Just keep the firewall on and keep it to software only from the store or authorized online developers. In any case if ANYTHING tries self-executing you’ll immediately know.",1524806027.0

It appears to happen randomly (it could probably be modelled as a Poisson distribution?) and I haven't noticed any particular method for reliably reproducing it. The most recent time it happened to me, I was typing a URL into Chrome (Chrome in its own full-screen space), and I was cycling down through suggestions. My Macbook started beachballing, and after recovering from the beachball, the graphical glitch was in effect.

It's always graphical, as I can still click buttons (but it makes it a nightmare to shutdown properly, and I sooner just force shut it off than open up a terminal to shut it down slightly more nicely).

Just wanted to do what I could to bring slightly more awareness to this issue.

It appears that it has to do with certain applications not playing nice with macOS GUI manager.

One can reset the WindowServer process by firing off the following command into your shell of choice:

    sudo killall -HUP WindowServer

Unfortunately, this will immediately close all of your open applications and log you out of your current session. However, all of your first party applications should reopen as they were before.

&#x200B;

**N.B.** If your situation is anything like mine, the UI glitch also affects the presentation of the default macOS terminal application, i.e. Terminal.app, so you might have to do it blind.

sfsdfd,"Yes, you're absolutely correct.

I encounter this problem in every application that supports multiple windows: Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Word, BBEdit, Adobe Acrobat, etc. Alt-tabbing just does not follow any consistent rhyme or reason. Often, the only way to get to the document that I *just tabbed away from* is to minimize every other window on top of it.

All of this is a manifestation of an inane design choice: making the Dock an interface that is focused on *applications*, rather than *windows*. You see one icon for Microsoft Word whether you're currently working with one document, or twelve documents, or *zero* documents.

This is absurd because users don't think, first and foremost, in terms of applications: they think in terms of *workpieces*. It's much more natural to think: ""I am working with three documents"" than ""I am working with Word (two documents) and Chrome (one document).""

The switcher models the same behavior: it is focused first and foremost on applications. You think you just tabbed away from Document 1 and into Document 2, and now you want to go back to Document 1. But the switcher thinks you tabbed away from Chrome (four open documents) and tabbed into Word (two open documents). When you tab back, the switcher simply tabs back into Chrome - not always the Chrome browser window that you were just viewing. Especially, as OP notes, if the switcher is also trying to do something clever regarding multi-monitor scenarios.

All of this is stupid and counterproductive and frustrating. It reflects poor design choices that overemphasize ""clean design"" over functionality. I'd rather have an OS that is easy to use than one merely looks pretty.

Microsoft went down the same path: the taskbar used to be a very clean metaphor - one taskbar entry per document - but they've gone hog-wild with ""pinning"" and ""grouping,"" so the taskbar is now a switcher, a launcher, and an organizer... all jammed into one clumsy metaphor where nothing really makes sense.

I feel like all of these companies are so wrapped up in glam and glitz - ""better Facebook integration! hotkeys for sharing photos on Instagram!"", etc. - that they've neglected the notion of giving users a functional, competent environment.

_Freak-of-nurture_,"So i have a 27"" 2012 iMac that has been reset to its factory settings. I've tried multiple times to update to high sierra, as everyone online says there should be no problems jumping from 10.8 mountain lion to 10.13. I've seen many people with other problems but never the issue i am having. after downloading High sierra, my iMac restarts to boot up the new OS and freezes as so in the video.
I tried re-downloading High sierra. tried a clean boot from an external drive. tried quite a few fixes others have recommended. At this point i assume i just need to go into the apple store, but rather not have to lug around my iMac thru the mall if i don't need to. any and all suggestions would be greatly appreciated! thanks in advance!!

First: (did a little creeping on you, sorry)

Second: look at the permissions in the Projects directory with `ls -al`. Just making sure you own it and you have the permission to delete it.

dfjdejulio,"I just fired up my Snow Leopard Server virtual machine to see how the mail app differs with regard to this between that version and what's current.

Today's mail app has an ""export mailbox"" menu item and an ""import mailbox"" menu item.  The older one seems to have ""archive mailbox"" instead of ""export mailbox"", but when you pick it, the behavior seems similar -- you're asked for a place in the filesystem to dump the archive.

What'd I'd suggest trying is exporting the mailbox(es?) to some shared location from Snow Leopard, and then trying the import mailbox menu item on High Sierra.  But I can't run this experiment myself right now, as I don't really have a quick non-destructive way to load reasonable test mail data into my Snow Leopard VM.

Well... that's what I'd suggest if the two client systems are the only ones allowed to be involved.  What I'd *really* suggest is making sure you have an IMAP mail account somewhere, connecting Snow Leopard to it, and dragging all your mail into one or more IMAP folders on that mail server.

dfjdejulio,"There is a *slim* chance they'll go with an in-house processor that uses the x64 instruction set instead of ARM.

Now, *if* they do that, and it's a fairly complete implementation, *then* it might not mean much.

But, one reason they might go this route is hinted at by what they've been telling developers recently.  For MacOS, you've pretty much got to support 64-bit in your applications.  They're deprecating 32-bit x86 support.

An in-house basically-x64-compatible chip *could* be optimized by completely eliminating support for all modes besides 64-bit.

And that *would* have implications for Boot Camp and gaming.

(But the most likely thing would be a switch to ARM, I think.  And that *almost* certainly means ""no more Boot Camp"", even with ARM on Windows, because the boot process and driver support for ARM is nowhere *near* as standardized as it is for x64.  VMWare or some other vendor will almost certainly step up, like it was back in the PowerPC days, but with an emulated CPU, performance ... won't be lovely.)",1522856572.0
deerfarce,"It means that natively, it won’t be supported without some kind of substrate or emulation layer that supports x64 code.

I’m all for Apple moving to in house chips, it just means that without substantial software rewrites (and possible performance hits) as a developer I won’t be able to use a Mac for work anymore, as I rely on docker and virtualbox.

We will always keep an eye on what domains get submitted, if a certain domain gets approved consistently we will add it to the white list. We also frequently ask the community to give feedback on the list, we do this through a monthly feedback thread.

West222,"I have a 2013 iMac and 2015 Macbook pro and don't have this problem with TD mode, so am just guessing at the solution here:

It seems like the problem is that after you leave your computers for a while sleep mode messes with your set up. Is that right?

The free app amphetamine prevents your Mac from entering sleep mode, so maybe this app on one, or both computers, might help. 



(Off topic, but I still can't believe that only Command-F2 enters TD mode and there is no other way. I have to have one keyboard plugged into the iMac all the time with my wireless apple keyboard connected to the Macbook pro. Hardly ideal.) ",1522636271.0

no1lives4ever,"I know that this is a old post, but have you tried resetting pram and smc on both the computers.

My setup consists of a 2011 27"" imac and a 2012 13"" rMBP connected by a thunderbolt cable. I face the following problems from time to time:

* I cant adjust volume when the sound output is set to iMac. Volume button is disabled on the mbp and i need to use screen sharing and connect to the iMac to adjust system volume.
* Volume control is disabled like above, and no sound comes. This cant be fixed by changing volume on the iMac
* When i wake up from sleep and the login screen is shown, the sound stops playing through the iMac. When i unlock the computer, sound again starts playing through the iMac. This is consistent behavior and i cant seem to find a workaround for this. This did not happen with the earlier combo of El Capitan on the rMBP and Yosemite on the iMac.
* Sometimes after waking up from sleep, the iMac display is blank. Disconnecting and reconnecting the iMac does not help. Taking iMac off target display mode and then again pressing cmd+f2 returns me back to the same situation. This is what you describe as your third situation.

I did face these issues in rare occasions in past, but with High Sierra on both the systems, I have started facing this on a regular basis. I dont normally restart my rMBP, i only close lid and open lid to sleep/wake it. In past i used to get 3-4 weeks of use before i needed to make a restart. With HS, i need to do a system restart and pram reset once every 2-3 days.

In all the above cases, except sound during login screen, the only solution is to restart the rMBP and reset the PRAM on that. The iMac's SMC or pram does not need to be reset to get things working. 

I hope this helps someone who comes in through google search like i did.

Guys, since a while ago, I've discovered that Seagate (known for its hard drives, etc.) offer a completely FREE version of the Paragon NTFS driver for Mac and you can download it from their website (https://www.seagate.com/it/it/support/software/paragon/)!

You don't even need to pay for others. This version is the first one (15.0.23) released since MacOS High Sierra came out and, even though Paragon now offers an updated version (15.1.70, which you would have to buy from their website), the ""older"" version works fine without any issues, at least in my case. You won't receive any upgrade/updates reminder because this is acting like an already registered app (thx Seagate!).

I've been using their software since 2013 and this is their latest iteration, so.. ;-)",1522423890.0

Man_Hu,"Some thoughts I have until now:

To serve you more, the OS needs more intelligence. Developers can plug in, enhance their applications and connect them with other applications in a game changing way. 

- connect applications in a smart way: finder / to-do / calendar / productivity apps... so they know of each other's task and anticipate the next step (eg. timer for project starts automatically if I open a file from my project location) 

- make finder smart: less searching for files and help for keeping structure, file name suggestion etc / different patterns for different projects if needed (redesign save/open dialog box)

- project feature: it connects all your files / locations / applications / partners etc, so it is right on your fingertips when you need it. (OS is aware of what you are working on, when you export something, it shows the location you usually export to and also provides you the option to share it instantly with people you usually share stuff in this project. If you work on a different project, other locations / other people show up. Also powerful integration of To-Do applications, Timer, Cloud, Alfred etc)

- easy automatisation: record repetitive tasks and set up rules with no programming.

- For all the above: It happens all on device and is not shared with anybody! #privacymatters

- Also: All features are designed in an unobtrusive way, I barely realise it, when I don't want to use it. But with few clicks I can greatly speed up my workflow.

looking forward to your ideas and thoughts... ",1522333122.0
howieisaacks,"In the long run, you're better off having all of your drives formatted for Mac. The reason for this is because FAT32 does not support file sizes larger than 4GB. Does this happen with EVERY FAT32 hard drive? I don't have this issue with either of my Macs, so that means that this is not specifically a High Sierra problem. Is this drive one that you built or did you purchase it as a complete unit? Some external hard drive enclosures have firmware that doesn't do well with Macs. I had one that would not sleep properly. It would drop the connection with my Mac every time it spinned down. Switching to a better enclosure fixed the issue. You don't have to do an erase and reinstall to fix this if reinstalling macOS turns out to be the right solution. You can run the macOS High Sierra installer right on top of your current install.

It’s much more likely that your external hard drive is failing, usually on the cheaper hard drives the USB > SATA controller breaks down after a few years and is most often the culprit.

CoffeeLinuxWeights,"Came from linux to macOS.  I run Windows 10 in a VM as needed.  On linux I was running Win10 with GPU passthrough and things were great.  Picked up a MBP and installed Vmware fusion and it handles some 3D acceleration using the metal framework (apples graphics engine) and is fine for most tasks.  I generally use windows only for 3D modeling and the like.  Unfortunately there are no APIs in macOS for gpu passthrough.  I'm hoping apple adds something for gpu passthrough with egpus eventually, granted, if that does happen it will be a decade away.  So for now I am doing a bootcamp install with  dedicated egpu and if I am on the road I can still do work with the discrete graphics as well.

Ok so on to the things you asked about...

You can use magnet (paid) or spectacle (free) for window tiling

No dark theme, apparently the assets exist and you can make some changes to the system to enable it but it's not full featured.  You may want to look into mySimbl for other tweaks.  There's a dark theme on mySimbl but it looks terrible. 

On my 2017 MBP I get around 11 hours with light to medium usage.  Most of my days are browsing, writing LaTeX docs, and admin stuff.

I never use the touch bar.  I turned it into a news ticker for a while but then I noticed, I never look at my keyboard, and why would I?  I have a screen.  The only thing that is useful for me is the volume and brightness sliders, but they could just as easily be on a set of F keys.  I still haven't gotten used to my key combo of Alt+Space to open the terminal window.  I would much rather have a function row and press F12.  For my virtual machines I changed the settings in MacOS to show the F keys when they're booted up and in focus.  You can have it show them all the time if you would like.

The touchpad is ridiculously large, but it's never given me issues.  I've never once been like ""oh man this thing is too big"". Which I guess is the point, being able to use it and not think about it.  If it were too small I would probably notice that.  I guess if I had to have one issue with the layout, it would be nice to have a smaller touchpad and more keys, like print screen and delete.  Even still, without remapping the macOS method for screenshots and going to the front and end of a line of text are fairly obnoxious.  I can't help but think they chose CMD+ -> for going to the end of a line and Home/End to go to the top and bottom of a document because they were in a weird teenager emo phase and just ran with it.

What's ridiculous about it. It gives you lots of flexibility with your hand positions. Apple's palm rejection is the best in the business - I've never had any mouse events caused by my palm. 

>Touchbar ""looks"" nice, but I miss the haptic feedback: If I touched the bar, I might accidentally pressed a touchbar-icon. Being developer and consultant I use my F-keys many times...

This should give you a fresh macOS with all your previous apps and files. If you machine is still panicking after this then there's probably some kind of app or macOS configuration that is causing it. 

You'd then need to format your MBP, reinstall macOS from recovery and then you can drag files individually from the Time Machine volume. 

However if I was doing this I would also make a clone of the MBP using CCC or SuperDuper. It's a lot easier to get files from a clone than from poking around the Time Machine layout.

arob216,"Regardless of whether you use reinstall or reformat and fresh install, the apps and settings from the backup may re-introduce the issue.

Most likely, there are some kext (drivers) that are not supported in the version of OS. If you recently installed hardware, or low level apps like virus protection, these may be causing the issues.

First thing to do, disconnect any external devices, and reset PRAM (CMD+OPT+P+R when you hear the boot chime). Hold the keys until the system reboots, repeat for at least two cycles then let it boot normally. Then, use the system for a while, this might clear up your issues as it removes kexts from cache and then reloads them fresh. If something got corrupted and has been causing panics, reloading might take care of it. 

If the problem persists, use kextstat | grep -v com.apple in the Terminal. This will list any kexts that are not Apple. it will look something like:

  154    0 0xffffff7f8597e000 0x88000    0x88000    com.avast.FileShield (4.0.0) B45B9A8D-AA3B-3EB1-9ED0-8D43D5D851A5 <5 4 1>

Look through the list for anything you may have recently added to the system. If there is an uninstaller, use it to remove the app. It might be best to boot into Safe Mode and run the uninstaller, this will tend to result in a cleaner uninstall if low level kexts are causing the issue.

Then, with this list printed or otherwise available to view ""offline"", while in Safe mode navigate to the location where the 3rd party kexts are loaded from (most likely /Users/username/System/Library/Extensions and do a rm -r to remove the offending kexts. Do this in Terminal...

Then, reset PRAM again. Repeat until the system is stable. Re-install anything you removed that did not fix the issue, but make sure the app is compatible with the OS version, get a newer version if not, or just don't use the offending app again.

I know it sounds like a lot of work, but you have to address the problem rather than re-introducing it by doing a restore.",1521736318.0

cpressland,"It’s the same on Linux and Windows now, fill the RAM with caches as quickly as possible to improve performance. Doesn’t make sense for it to sit there idle. The Kernel compresses the memory to improve performance further, this is represented as”Memory Pressure”. When the pressure is too high things will slow down, the only solution to that is to close down some apps.

Like always, empty ram is a waste, just let everything fill up your ram, and if only you really need to run some demanding application, you can start closing what you don't need.

That’s why Apple added the “memory pressure” graphic to Activity Monitor. If you start a bunch of active user processes that eat RAM (like try to bake something in Blender), those caches will be wiped to make room. If nothing else can be wiped and active processes start taking up more RAM, the RAM pressure will increase and that’s when you’ll know there’s actually a problem that may affect your computer’s performance.

There are a lot more, however these are the essential 'misc' apps I use.

## TIps:
+ Screen shots on Mac: https://www.imore.com/screenshot-mac
+ Preview, the built in image/document viewer is really handy. It has basic markup and basic PDF editing. It's ability to add signatures to a PDF make it helpful to me: https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/how-to-sign-pdfs-mac-preview

## YouTube channels with macOS tips:

ctesibius,"Have a look at the title bar of a document. Just to the left of the name of the document there is a small icon which represents the document type. It looks like eye candy, but it actually represents the document itself. So say you have a PDF open in Preview. Alt-click (I think you call it Option-click with a USAian keyboard) on that icon, and hold until it turns dark. Now you can drag that icon into an email to form an attachment - you don't need to find the file in Finder, or use the paper-clip button in Mail.

This is a general method, not something specific to Mail and Preview. For instance I often want to do some operations on a Word document (copy it, ZIP it, etc.) and for my purposes it's easier to work in the command line window. Ok, I've got the document open in Word, but I want to find the right directory in the command line window, and that's a lot of typing. So I type ""cd "" at the command line (which means ""change directory""), then use the same method to drag the file icon in to the command line window. That pastes the directory in to the command line, so I just have to press ""Enter"" and I'm where I want to be. You probably won't want to use the command line, but the general method of using that little icon turns out to be a time saver in many circumstances.

--------

Another little trick is ""text clippings"" - at least I think that's the name. Highlight a bit of text in this message. Now click and hold for a moment before dragging it. You can release the text in another document, which is a bit like cut and paste. But you can also drag the text to a folder in the Finder, or on to the Desktop, then drag it back in to a document later. That's nice if you want to do something like cut and paste, but with multiple chunks of text in different orders.",1521726295.0

KirtashShek,"I had the same problem, you can solve following the guide:

As I understand it, you have a Mac with no Administrator accounts. Of course that is not supposed to be possible, but if that really is the case you can use the following technique to create a new, temporary Administrator account, the sole purpose of which will be to log in as an Administrator that can give your normal account Admin privileges.
 
There may be other techniques to recover from the ""impossible"" circumstance in which you find yourself, but the following is one that I have successfully used in the past.
 
It will not work in the following circumstances:
 
* If you configured an EFI Firmware Password that will preclude recovery, unless you know that password.
* It won't work if you encrypted your startup volume with FileVault.

Please read everything that follows before continuing. If you have only the one computer you will need to print this for reference.
 
* Power on or restart your Mac.
* At the chime or grey screen, hold ⌘ and S on your keyboard (two fingers) to enter single-user mode.
* At the localhost:/ root# prompt, type
 
fsck -fy

...and press Return.

This is a simple check for file system integrity and is optional. It may take a few minutes to complete during which time various messages will appear. None of them are relevant unless they indicate some unrecoverable error. Be patient. If you get concerned that the system has stalled or become unresponsive press the Return key. Nothing will happen other than to echo the Return character, advancing the text on the screen, confirming your Mac has not completely frozen.

When the integrity check completes pressing the Return key will result in the localhost prompt again, waiting for your input.
 
* At the localhost:/ root# prompt, type each of the following lines, exactly as written, including capitalization, one line at a time, each line followed by the Return key. There is a single space preceding the first ""slash"" ( / ) character in each line:
 
mount -uw /
rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone
reboot
 
The Mac will restart, and then take you through the entire setup and registration process that you have not seen since you originally unboxed it. Do not be concerned—none of the above deletes any information. All your pre-existing user accounts will still available, assuming they were not already erased prior to beginning this procedure.
 
Do not elect to transfer your information from another Mac: When you get to the ""Transfer Information to This Mac"" screen, select ""Do not transfer any information now"" and press Continue. Have your existing Apple ID and password ready. At the ""Create a Computer Account"" screen, create the new, temporary account using a different ""Full name"" and ""Account name"" than the one you already use. Remember the password you select. You don't have to sign in to iCloud or anything else you might decide to do if you wanted to use that User Account for anything else.
 
When it completes, log in under that new account. Use System Preferences to change your normal account to ""Allow user to administer this computer"". Log out, log in under your normal account and verify you can use it without restriction.
 
After that, you can safely delete the temporary account you just created by following these instructions: Delete a user or group - Apple Support. Before removing it, confirm you don't need any of the files you might have created in that Account.

I got as far as to install from recover but it is still mac high sierra and then it followed the same path after I put password.

Thoughts? 

I am downloading sierra and planing to make a bootable USB.

I have seen some videos online however I am downloaded that file and will be creating the bootable drive from my iMac. Not sure if the terminal commands are the same.

retsotrembla,"You can copy files off your external, format it as journaled HFS, then put the files back on, and still use it as a time machine drive.

Time machine will work this way.

But, the files you put back on won't be backed up. 

Also, you'll eventually get alerts from Time Machine saying that it had to delete an older backup to make the current backup fit. You'll get those alerts no matter what, but you'll get them sooner if you have other stuff on the drive taking up space.

8xk40367,"I think the first reply is the correct one; you can share a Time Machine drive, and it will work fine though it's not ideal.

I have an external drive which I use for Time Machine, the Content Caching service, and as temp space for all my automation.  It works.

If you fill up the disk, Time Machine will always back off what it keeps, so it will eventually cry about needing to delete some stuff to make room.  That's not a problem unless you want TM to keep every version of every file you ever had.

I wouldn't partition the drive, as that just means you end up with two volumes that are never the right size - and it doesn't really buy you much.  There's no problem sharing the space as long as you don't touch the Time Machine directory (it's just a plain directory system, you can use Finder to drag and drop files to restore them - but don't ever try to put TM files into the trash, as you'll find out you can't delete them).",1520616989.0
DaemonCRO,"You can, but It’s better not to. 

TM file (sparse bundle) is actually a mini partition in itself, and when you enter TM you mount that partition. That partition is dynamic, obviously. I’ve initially tried using TC hardware as both TM drive and as storage, and it becomes pretty laggy if I am streaming a movie from it and one of my Macs decides it’s time to update. And the update then takes longer. 

You might also encounter issues with backups, because depending on what you do in it as file storage (add files, remove files) the empty space will vary. And the TM won’t know how much space there is left, so it could drop old backups etc. Essentially due to empty space being unpredictable and unstable as you add/remove other files, TM won’t really know how much back-dated stuff to keep. Maybe you could set a partition, so it knows how much is left. But it’s all a meh solution IMO. 

Of course if you buy a huuuuge drive, and speed isn’t an issue, well, you might do it. ",1520580787.0

4.	In the same Terminal window, type      pmset -a disksleep 0      and hit <return>. This will stop the SSD (or HD) from sleeping
5.	Quit Terminal and select Disk Utility from the Recovery Mode window
6.	Select any volumes that are on the SSD (or HD) and unmount them if they are mounted
7.	Select the SSD (or HD) in the list on the left. Make sure you are selecting the hardware device that contains the Mac System and Bootcamp volumes
8.	Select File -> New... -> Image from Disk xxxx
9.	Locate your external drive and choose a location on it to store the Disk Image.
10. Change the type of Disk Image to “Compressed” to save space on the external drive
11. Click the “Save” (or Image?) button to start the copy

wetfish-db,"Text rendering works very differently on Windows to Mac.  Windows uses ClearType, which pretty much always makes text look crisp - but it does so by slightly deforming the font to fit the pixel grid.  Mac tries to retain the font style more, but that can result in slightly blurrier text sometimes.

Also, the scaling works different in both platforms.  The reason why 100% and 200% look crisp is because they still use the same grid - if it was 1 pixel wide it would now be 2.  If it was 2 it would now be 4.  All nice round numbers.  But i you use 125% scaling, if it was 1 pixel wide, it would now be 1.25 pixels wide - but you can't render 1.25 pixels so it would attempt to anti-alias the text.  And that's what causes the blurring on text.

The only thing you could try doing which is to turn the LCD font smoothing on/off.  It's in preferences, general, and there is an option for LCD font smoothing when available.  You could try turning that on/off to see if it helps.  Note: technically there is a third option but you'd have to use terminal to enable that.

 (On something earlier than 10.6? Buy it for $20 then follow the links below:

Maybe you're too young, but in 2010, that was totally normal.

Then you can just update to 10.13. Unlike Windows, Mac OS isn’t really something you “purchase” it kind of just comes with your Mac and once you have it you can update to the most recent version (high sierra) if your Mac is supported. There’s no activation. You should technically be able to do the online restore but since it’s not working for you (probably your grandfather never updated Mac OS and the snow leopard (2010 edition of Mac OS X) install restore server doesn’t exist anymore).

llO_ol,"I don't know if this is typical, but this has happened to me anytime I mess with ms-dos based partitions/volumes; the only means I know of to circumvent those limitations is through the terminal. Partitioning a disk will format it, so make sure to transfer any data you want to keep. You might be able to avoid that with splitPartition, but I'm not certain. I'll talk about the partitionDisk option below, though.

* First, eject your external drive.
* Hit Command + SpaceBar, type in terminal, hit enter.
* List all of your drives by typing in: diskutil list
* Now, plug in your external drive, and go back to terminal and hit the up arrow on your keyboard, or you can retype in: *diskutil list*. Now, hit enter.
* Compare the lists, now write down the disk number that shows up after plugging in your external drive. The name should be something like, */dev/disk#*, **make sure you know the disk you want to work with before proceeding**

From there, you can partition your disk with diskutil with the partitionDisk option after unmounting your external drive. You can read more about the usage of *diskutil* usage on it's man page if you feel like learning more about it, either at a site like [ss64.com](https://ss64.com/osx/diskutil.html) or by typing *man diskutil* in terminal.

**As an example, say you want to partition a disk with the GPT or GUID partitioning scheme:**  
*diskutil partitionDisk disk3 3 GPT HFS+ vol1 25% MS-DOS VOL2 25% HFS+ vol3 50% Free\ Space volX 0%*  
**where**  
*diskutil partitionDisk <device> <number of partitions> <partition scheme> <part1 file system> <part1 name> <part1 size> <part2 file system> <part2 name> <part2 size>*  
  
In your case, say your external drive is disk 3 after you plug it in, and you want two exfat partitions on a disk with GPT format, with equal space split between the partitons. The partitions will be named EXFATONE, and EXFATTWO respectively:  
First, unmount the external drive, with   
  
*diskutil unmountDisk disk3*  
  
Then begin the partitioning:  
  
*diskutil partitionDisk disk3 2 GPT ExFat EXFATONE 50% ExFat EXFATTWO 50%*  
  
**Please make sure you are certain of the disk you are performing the command on, it is entirely possible to overwrite your primary disk if youre not careful.**",1520309085.0

zankky,"13” mbp ntb 16gb ram and have lots and lots of issues I didn’t have with my 2010 mbp 13” with 8gb ram. Some of the things I’ve noticed:

- when the laptop is in sleep, it runs through my battery. My old mbp only lost small amounts in sleep but this one is very very bad. 

- when I wake from sleep it takes a few seconds to be able to register keystrokes for password. With my 2010 I could start typing before the login screen even fully appeared and it worked fine

- quite a few times when I wake the mbp it turns out it randomly shut itself down and has to restart. A few times a week. This only happened a handful number of times with my old mbp.

- lots of random cpu spikes

- somehow the OS eats away random empty space on my ssd. I had 100gb free, and at some point despite 0 new downloads realized I had a few gb left. I keep deleting media files and the os keeps eating up empty space

Also keep in mind I didn’t restore an old backup to my 2017 mbp. Installed only software I needed (parallels, office, and a few small pieces of software) and that’s it. With my 2010 the last time I did a clean install was 2012. Since then I experimented with lots of software, installed uninstalled, always on the latest macos. And yet it ran better. 

So yeah I’m having a similarly frustrating experience due to a mix of software and hardware. And the issue with taking it to Genius Bar is none of these things seem identifiable to some hardware so doubt they can isolate the issues or reproduce them.

MrCertainly,"I've said this before, and I still stand by it: The ""Macbook Pro"" is no longer a computer designed for working 'professionals', even though ""pro"" is in the name.

They've sacrificed ethernet, usb ports, thunderbolt ports, a keyboard with a decent travel, battery life, screen size (no more 17"")...all in the name of ""thinness"". A quality that is NOT high on the wishlist of a working professional who's buying a 15""+ laptop.

Also, the new trackpad is comically large. So many accidental touches. Now Apple just patented a touchpad keyboard for the Macbook -- eliminating physical keys entirely. I mean, it's starting to seem like no one at One Apple Park Way actually *uses their computer* for 8-14 hours per day.

My laptop exhibited random crashes (mainly from sleep and Thunderbolt dock (dis)connection, always ran hot and was extremely slow.

**My painful solution:** wipe your Mac clean, reinstall macOS and *manually* restore your user account.

I hate solutions that border on voodoo and gross actions that resolve mysterious problems without revealing the cause, but I had to get back to work.

A few things are in play here:
 * Years of playing with hidden system preferences (ala ""TinkerTool"").
 * Various system KEXTs, Launch Agents & Daemons.
 * Other system changes that I'm sure happened as I used my laptop as a dumping ground of software and hacks.
 * Firefox

Reinstalling macOS cleanly, and manually restoring my user account ensured that I didn't reintroduce any hidden preferences I didn't want.

Firefox was interesting. It was my main browser and it would be great on first start, but given a little time it dragged my system to a crawl every single time and pushed my CPU temps up. On my recent MBP rebuild, I actually turned off ""Use HW Acceleration"" and anecdotally everything's been running cool and smoothly on my laptop. I guess it was taking my GPU, especially with a 4K monitor.

kb3pxr,"Hold down option, click on the Apple Menu and select ""System Information.""  Go down to Power under hardware and you will see a lot of data about your battery.

There are a few lines to look at (note this is real data I'm showing, yours WILL be different):

    Full Charge Capacity (mAh):	6418

The closer to 7150 the better on that.

    Cycle Count:	119

The closer to zero the better, my 119 is rather low. The closer to 500 (might by 1000 on MacBook Air) this is, more wear your battery has.

    Condition:	Normal

If this is anything else, your machine needs service.

Now that the hardware checks are out of the way (and I hope yours are reassuring), we can go for the software checks. Next, open the activity monitor and go to the energy tab. Sort by the ""Preventing Sleep"" column to see if there are any ""Yes"" entries. These will cause sleep problems, quit the apps in question.

While we are in activity monitor, let's go to the memory tab and look at the ""Memory Pressure"" Graph, this should never be red, if you see it red, you need to quit/restart apps or get an upgraded machine. Green is ideal, and yellow is acceptable. Red will also show as a performance issue.

Now, the next thing to check is CPU loading, we could do this in the Activity monitor, but I'm a bit old school and understanding the output of ""uptime"" is easier for me. You will need the terminal to do this, but don't panic, it isn't as scary as it looks and I'm only having you execute a single command.

In the terminal execute this command:

    uptime

You will get a result like this:

    15:53  up 2 days,  2:14, 2 users, load averages: 1.70 2.48 2.44

In my example we have the local time (15:53 hours), the time the machine has been up since last reboot (2 days, 2 hours, and 14 minute), number of users (2 with one being you in the GUI and the other being you logged into terminal). Load averages are what we are looking for. Mine are rather high for my liking, but that is due to the power saving (reduced speed increases the average). If you see any of those numbers in the 3 or 4 range (or higher), then there is cause for concern. If you haven't done so already, do a Command-Q to quit the terminal.

You mentioned sleep issues with the lid closed, well, this is actually easy enough to check IF THE SCREEN WAKES UP. We will simulate closing the lid, but leave it open. Apple uses a magnetic sensor in this model which I discovered by accident. Place a magnet near the headphone jack and you will trigger the sensor. This magnet can be anything handy with a magnet. An earpod or a corded landline phone handset will work wonderfully for this. Once the machine goes to sleep, any wakeup activity that turns on the internal screen will be obvious.

Lastly let's do resets and reinstalls again. We want to reset the SMC and the NVRAM with the SMC being the most important (I've had to do this a grand total of once in my 2.5 years of owning this same model).",1519506282.0

Troll__McLure,"> How do I force macOS to ignore the SQLite located in /usr/bin and to use the newer version installed with Homebrew? Since High Sierra also uses SIP I can't just delete the ""wrong"" version and symlink to the right one.

It looks like macOS itself is already doing this, when calling SQLite3 on the shell. 

Does your PHP/testing environment also keep the correct `$PATH`?

I don't normally use PHP/phpunit, so this is probably terribly hacky, but did a short test against this `test.php` file:

    <?php
    use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

    class PathTest extends TestCase
    {
	    public function testOne()
	    {
	    	fwrite(STDERR, print_r($_ENV, TRUE));
                fwrite(STDERR, print_r('SQLite3 version: ' . exec('sqlite3 --version'), TRUE));
	    	$this->assertTrue(True);
	    }
    }
    ?>

I put this in the same folder as the downloaded `phpunit-6.5.phar`, and called it with:

    ./phpunit-6.5.phar --verbose test

Just keep in mind that us humans tend to be more vocal about something thats wrong than to be positive about something thats not.

As for your question, i have yet to encounter big issues other than the ones that they haven't solved since Sierra, do keep in mind that if you use older software which predates Sierra you may encounter issues with these but it's unlikely.

There is an issue with the Filesize limitation of FAT32 (2GB instead of 4GB) and probably a few other very minor things.

If it really does do things you don't like i'm sure there is someone around who backed up the Sierra installer so you can roll back, i wouldn't worry too much about it :)",1519291811.0

galacticspark,"Ok let's start at the top.  And I need to add an obligatory TL;DR: I don't have good news.

> I have a 13"" MacBook Pro that's less than a month old. It's been working great until it froze up out of the blue today and rebooted itself to the blinking ""?"" folder icon. I booted into recovery mode and tried to reinstall High Sierra - it started fine but got hung up at around 3 min remaining. After leaving it for a while, I rebooted and tried again - same thing happened again, got stuck at 3 min remaining.

Sounds like you have a dead internal flash drive.  You can try reformatting it all day and night, but that won't fix it.  

Dead drives, either Hard Drive or Solid State Drive, usually act in one of two ways: 

* Dead, will not boot.  Totally dead.  

* Act oddly--installs randomly fail, but then everything seems ok, but then something is not ok.  The only real telltale clue was something like:

> It's been working great until it froze up out of the blue today and rebooted itself to the blinking ""?"" folder icon.

On a side note, a dead hard drive can happen at any time, and interestingly, flash storage isn't necessarily more resilient than spinning drives.  I do have some good news here: it will be covered under warranty.

> And here's what the Disk Utility app is showing, for reference: https://imgur.com/a/TVBH6
Seems weird that they're listed as read-only...considering it keeps telling me permission denied it seems like that may be at least part of the problem.

Couple of things here.  APFS was [recently introduced](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/715/?time=242), and it was an effort to fix some of the problems with [Apple's existing filesystem, HFS+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System).  If you're using a solid state drive, [you must use APFS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208033), otherwise, it's up to you.  The ""empty"" container is the APFS container on the drive, but since you've said that OS installs fail, then it looks like the drive itself is dead.  The permission denied is likely because the Computer/OS does not have access to the FileVault.  Assuming you know the password, you can forcibly unlock it in Terminal with this command:

        diskutil list

        # look for the UUID of the FileVault Volume, then type

        diskutil coreStorage unlockVolume UUID

        # enter password when prompted

However, if you cannot get access to Terminal because the OS has crashed, then this is a moot point; the only possibility would be copying the data off and then attempting data recovery (yes, you would still need the password, that's what FileVault is for).


> A couple more things to note, not sure if they're relevant or not. Less than an hour before that happened I changed my ""login"" keychain password in the Keychain Access app. Also, FileVault was on.

Ah.  That's...not good news.  The OS is trying to mount the drive, even read-only as a last resort, but it may not be able to if the keychain password didn't get updated (but this is speculation).  My point here is the odds of recovering data from a dead hard drive are not good, and they're astronomically low if there's FileVault on, and they're even lower if you just changed the password.  If you don't care about the data or it's backed up, then disregard this paragraph.

> I don't know what else to do except to take it to the Genius Bar, maybe it's a faulty drive? Idk. Hope somebody has some suggestions. I'd be happy to send $15 in bitcoin (or any other crypto) to whoever solves this for me :)

Don't worry about the bitcoin, hope you get everything fixed!  Setup a Genius Bar Appointment, they can help you out.

Edit: clarification

Edit2: I took another look at the error log, because something was bugging me.  It definitely looks like a dead drive, however, there is a small chance that the formatting scheme isn't being set up correctly.  What you need to do is 

1) Take it to the Genius Bar and let them do it

Or, if you're feeling very brave and adventurous, and want to setup an APFS scheme manually in Terminal:

2) delete the volumes *inside* the APFS container, delete the container, then create a new APFS container and new volumes inside the APFS container.  If this fails, then it's a dead drive.  Use the UUID or Human readable name for each volume.  $NEWVOLUME is the name of the new APFS volume.

        diskutil apfs deleteVolume UUID 

        # optional/may be required: diskutil apfs unmountVolume UUID

        diskutil apfs deleteContainer UUID

        diskutil apfs createContainer disk0

        diskutil apfs disk0 addVolume APFS $NEWVOLUME

Scrambled111,"Ok. This is gonna be fun. Jokes aside, I think I have a vague enough idea of what’s happening to help you possibly understand to find a solution.

I think when you changed the login in the keychain, it didn’t automatically change anything until it shuts down or goes into a sleep mode of sorts. Then, you try the first logical thing, to reinstall the os. (Thinking about it, I had an oddly similar problem with my Mac). It froze, rebooted and tried again. However, if I remember correctly, your changing your login via the keychain changed some permissions problem that made the recovery halt. Thus, it being a permissions issue that can’t always simply be fixed by installing via Apple’s recovery solution. 

How do you fix it?
I don’t actually know how to so take this part with a grain of salt (not sure if that’s the right phrase. Just keep on reading lol). You will have to erase the base partition. DO NOT erase the recovery partition or any other partitions as those are important or will be what you install macOS from again. Also, when erasing your partition, you will most likely need to be user root. 

This is about all I can help. Sorry if it doesn’t do much for you but I tried my best. Good luck my friend. ",1519281869.0

galacticspark,"Here are a few solutions to try, with comments added regarding potential risk.  Back everything up first.

1) Reboot via Terminal (no risk)

        sudo reboot

Comments:

* You will need to type your admin password

* Based on your description, it sounds like the file system is ok, but I'd still make sure that all important files are backed up.  

* If I had to guess, one or more of the files that trigger a predefined set of steps for shutting down or restarting, called an [Event](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1134/_index.html) somehow got deleted or corrupted.  This event can be triggered manually or manipulated a few ways, or simply bypassed by telling the operating system to restart in Terminal.

2) Trigger the OS to set up a new admin account, hopefully resetting any missing or corrupted preferences (risk: minimal)


        # reboot into single user mode, then type the following commands, note the space

        /sbin/fsck -fy
        /sbin/mount -uw /
        rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone

        reboot

Comments:

* when the computer reboots, follow the prompts to create a new admin account.  **DO NOT** use the same name as any existing account, or it will be deleted without warning.  Then try to log out of the newly created account to see if that will fix the problem.

3) Shutdown computer (risk: moderate)

        sudo shutdown -h now

Comments:

* There isn't any specific risk, per se, but based on your description, there is a small chance that stopping all processes completely by shutting down the computer may result in you not being able to start the computer back up again successfully.

* After shutting down the computer, wait 1-2 minutes for the HD to spin down, then start back up.  Wait 10 seconds instead if you have a solid state drive.

4) Forcibly reboot (risk: moderately high)

        sudo reboot -q 

Comments:

* Use this step only as a last resort, because it comes with its own dangers that may or may not be justified.  Basically, you're pulling the plug on the computer, then hoping as part of the startup sequence, the OS will go through its recovery sequence and realize there are corrupted files and repair them.   There is a risk of data loss with this.

daphenejtor,"I'm basically in your exact position and I'm going to be getting a 15"" Surface Book 2. I am a webbdeveloper who photo edits A LOT on my free time so then pen input will come in handy for photos and the GTX 1060 will be awesome for WebGL stuff etc, the top specc MacBook Pro is still lacking heavily in the GPU department but the main reason for me wanting to switch is the hardware on the new MacBooks, they feel like toys compared to the 2015 version that I have with the keyboard without key travel and no escape key. It sucks because I absolutely LOVE MacOS. 

However, I have been coding a lot at home in the recent weeks (since coming up with the idea of switching to Windows) and it has been flawless with the WSL. I just thought I'd chime in here, since you've posted this in the MacOS subreddit I think the response will be very biased and I wanted to just share my thoughts in that: It's not all that bad. I finally have good performance to back up a pretty solid OS whereas before I had a better OS but with a pretty severe lack in power for both photo and dev work. (I'm comparing my gaming machine at home to my MacBook, not at all fair but seeing that I will be getting a really powerful GPU in the Surface Book, not all that unfair either.)

Sure, you will miss things, but since the rise of Electron apps you'll actually find more things than you might have thought. 

With all this said, I'm not saying that you should absolutely switch or anything, just saying that you'll survive either way. I just can't justify paying over $3k for a laptop that has been downgraded with every single ""update"" since I bought mine in 2015. Worse keyboard, removal of useful ports (I use the SD-Card reader every single day) and the implementation of the touch bar that's just.. Beyond useless. 

I get that I might get downvoted to hell, even if I do love MacOS, but I think that I might actually be able to help you out so I guess I'll take it.

rkennedy12,"With how many problems I’ve recently had with my MacBook you would think I’d be switching. 

I’m a developer (on the side) also and MacOS is next to none. 

At my day job as an engineer we use the windows platform. I have all the latest updates installed for windows 10 which by the way happen pretty much everyday - a lot of the time not even giving you the option to shut it down without doing the update so a bunch of time is wasted when I’m ready to leave and instead have to sit there watching the update screen. 

Even with all these updates the thing runs like trash. Random spikes in cpu, memory, and disk usage for even menial system tasks. Random bugs plague the whole system (one time I just tried to make a shortcut in the start menu - it disappeared into Narnia and I had to reboot to recover) 



This brings me to my next point in usability. As a Mac developer I’m guessing you rely on spotlight search to get to what you need quickly. Windows search is unusably slow half the time. I believe it goes through Cortana for everything which proves to be as useless as Siri. 



If you are set on switching to an alternative to a MacBook, Buy a good computer that you know will have hardware support within MacOS and set up a “hackintosh”. That’s the only way I see you leaving even slightly satisfied from a switch.

bruncky,"I’d recommend installing Windows 10 on Boot Camp and dual booting that way for the easiest solution. You could also do that just to try out Windows for a bit, don’t even need to activate your install, which makes it free.


&nbsp;


However, if you’re willing to work out all the kinks, a Hackintosh isn’t that bad an idea. You’d need to be careful with updates because you usually have to wait a few days (or weeks) to update in a way that it doesn’t break your install, and backing up constantly is strongly advised — generally speaking, but more so than with a legit macOS install. I myself (also a dev) have the following setup:

-	256GB SSD; Windows 10
-	3TB HDD for main storage; Windows 10 exclusively (also an amateur streamer and a gamer, so I need the main storage on Windows)
-	1TB SSHD; Hackintosh

I know it is a desktop in my case, but my point is to say that while kind of difficult and time-consuming, dual booting Windows 10 and Hackintosh installations is certainly a viable option. Using a single HDD/SSD is actually easier to get working, because you’ll be sharing the same EFI partition — macOS has the annoying habit of hogging Windows’ bootloader from its EFI when installed as the second OS, making Windows unbootable at first.


&nbsp;


So personally, as someone who is not afraid of working out PC problems — you also seem to be unafraid of doing so —, getting a Windows 10 laptop and dual booting Hackintosh is an idea worth considering.


&nbsp;


Lastly, on the topic of Windows 10 and how it runs: not as well as macOS, by a longshot. It takes longer to be ready for usage depending on your startup programs, it gets too many updates from a slow ass server — although you can turn off auto-updates to mitigate that — and it isn’t as simple as macOS. The search doesn’t hold a candle to Spotlight in terms of speed and the UI isn’t as simple.

But you’ll get used to it, and you’ll be happier every time you go back to macOS. It’s not a great OS, in my opinion, but it’s not the worst either. The ecosystem is different and therefore will require some getting used to, but I bet you’ll learn the way of the Windows in no time.

Sumpfiger,"I think it basically boils down to bang for the buck vs. comfort, just like most of the time when it comes to win vs. mac:

* Windows 10 is great. Most of the complaining you hear about (a lot of time from die-hard Apple fans) are issues from the past or a user-problem. Sure it does have many flaws but so does MacOS and in recent years Windows  improved much more than MacOS did.
* I only used WSL for a short try so I cannot really say anything about it. Knowing Microsofts track-record, I would however expect that it will have its issues since it's quite new. It might work for you but I say you are on a safer side with Mac/Linux.
* Hardware-wise it's always the same argument. Win-machine has better specs, Mac is probably more reliable. I think if you could create an average price of a Macbook and a Windows Laptop of similar specs and add costs like lost time due to failures, repairs, resale-value etc. my belief is Windows might still win, but not by a large margin.
* I strongly recommend going into a shop and trying the devices. I was set for a HP laptop at first because of paper-specs. I'm no fan of touchbar or the keyboard of Mac either but sometimes it's the small things that you cannot read about that make a difference. For me it was the incredibly good trackpad, the better anti-reflection coating on the superb screen and the overall build-quality especially on the hinge that made me go for a Macbook instead.",1519306436.0

sfsdfd,"""Moving the existing files"" = import them and then delete the Photos folder. But that's not what you want - what you want is for the Photos library to be simply an index over your Photos folder, so that you can continue to arrange them how you want, right?

Sadly, Photos isn't set up that way. It insists on being a silo for your data. And in my opinion, Apple deliberately makes it difficult to move photos *out* of Photos for that very reason.

This design choice is odd, because iTunes can easily be configured solely as an index over your music. You can put your music wherever you want, name it what you want, organize it how you want - iTunes will be totally hands-off.

And that's why 100% of my music is in iTunes, and 0% of my photos are in Photos.

Also, I have no idea of Apple will turn this into abandonware some day, like they have in the past with other products.  So I am still searching for the right Photo management program, but in the mean time, I used Photo Organizer Pro combined with DropBox so my photos do not have duplicates and exist on Dropbox AND the local cache.

I second anyone suggesting to use DaisyDisk and scanning as admin to determine where all your space has gone. It’s a great tool and easy to work with.


&nbsp;


However, another good app to have is [Disk Doctor](https://itunes.apple.com/br/app/disk-doctor-system-cleaner/id455970963?l=en&mt=12) (I hope the link works, I’m on the phone), which will take care of deleting application logs for you. If memory serves, the first time I used this I deleted ~25GB worth of application logs. I’m aware that this could be done using DaisyDisk, but Disk Doctor is more of a ‘plug and play’ option and is also cheaper. However, if you plan on paying for DaisyDisk anyways, then Disk Doctor is not worth buying.


&nbsp;


Lastly, if this is due to TM’s local snapshots, there’s a very easy way to solve the problem. All you need is a Terminal command, namely

`sudo tmutil thinlocalsnapshots /`

For a very detailed explanation on what it does and how to use it, refer to [this post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/309143/how-to-thin-your-local-time-machine-snapshots-on-macos-high-sierra?rq=1) and look at Joshua Pinter’s answer.",1518532476.0

Now to win the prize my guess is that you connected an iPhone to your Mac and iTunes has backed up the iPhone to your iTunes library. An easy way to check is to open iTunes, open preferences and look under devices and see if there’s any back ups, they could be huge. The other big culprit is a log that’s going bananas. Good luck!

jarsta,"Apple (https://support.apple.com/kb/SP582?locale=en_US) says the MBP 15"" mid-2010 model only supports memory up to 8GB. 

Your issues sound similar to what is described in this Stack Exchange answer https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/105036 and it seems to be an EFI limitation so you're pretty much out of luck and limited to max 8GB.",1518268336.0
zankky,"One thing I could say is that in the 2010 mbp c2d 13inch, 8gb was the max ram you could have. I am not sure what configuration the 15” is, but if it’s the same processor I’d assume the same restriction would apply. But I wouldn’t bet on it because first of all the 15 is pro’er than 13 and manbe can handle more memory. Second, if you put in two much ram it just shows the max limit without having issues. 
If you have 2x 4mb ram id give that a try. 
Secondly, maybe research specifically which ram modules others have used. Macs are finicky with compatibility. For example in the 2010 13inch macs there were only certain types of ssd’s you could use as the Toshiba controllers were compatible but micron was not and if you used the wrong one you would get random reboots. 

As far as ram goes I remember there’s pc2700 3200 etc. And I bet the 8gb module is way faster than the computer can handle. But that doesn’t explain why Linux is working. I’d still think it’s a hardware issue and not software especially if you’ve installed a fresh OS. ",1518268432.0

In theory you could try to use a compressed disk image, but you’re not gonna get much benefit for the hassle.

P1nCush10n,"If you're using Time Machine, more than likely a large portion of that space is being consumed by the local snapshots.  They will drop off as space is required by other user processes..  Basically MacOS works on the principal of, ""if the user isn't using it, the OS uses it until needed.""

If you want to see how many snapshots you have drop to a terminal and run 

    tmutil listlocalsnapshots /

If you have really old ones and it's bothering that much you can delete them individually:

    sudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots <date of snapshot as show in previous command>

Example:

    sudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2018-01-05-140813

If these snapshots are few, but large, you may want to consider adding some exclusions to your time machine backups. I exclude my ""downloads"" directory for this very reason.

As far as Defragmentation is concerned, on an SSD system, don't.

Defragmentation was designed to move/optimze data layout on a physical platter drive, which was subject to delays in reads due to head travel, RPMs, etc.  SSD architecture has no ""travel"" or suboptimal places to store data within the silicon. If there are ""gaps"" in the current layout of your data, they will eventually be filled by fragmenting future files.  If you did manage to fill a drive the cumulative size of any remaning gaps would probably not buy you any sufficient space to be useful. ",1517946498.0

my_clock_is_wrong,"turn off ""automatically rearrange spaces"" for starters in system preferences->mission control - it just confuses things IMO. Then you can set up your layout.

How you arrange them is up to you but my layout has desktop 1 for every day stuff, finder windows, safari etc - desktop 2 is productivity app (xcode or photoshop etc -only one at a time though) - desktop 3 is documentation, desktop 4 is mail. 

Go into system preferences->keyboard->shortcuts and enable ""switch to desktop N"" for all your spaces. Then you can control + number to switch to that desktop number.

control + left or right changes to the next space - control + up is mission control (and you can control + left or right here as well) and control down for expose on the active application window. Control is right next to the arrow keys on an external keyboard so it's an easy one handed shortcut, otherwise learn the touchpad gestures.  IMHO mission control, spaces and expose shine when using a touchpad and you can easily get up to speed with flipping around multiple desktops with a few simple hand motions. Feels like minority report.

Thats my basic workflow - if I want to work on a thing like a photo or diagram, I move the app (photoshop, pages, whatever) to it's own desktop. I don't use full screen but that's a personal preference. when I'm done I go back to my 4 main desktops.

ciera22,"as others mentioned already uncheck automatically re-arrange. once you've done that you can pretty much create and manage spaces on each display the same way you would individual windows on a single display. just drag and drop and arrange them to suit your work flow (for example one space for your editor in full screen, another for terminal windows & ssh/ftp clients, browser window & documentation and output window on the other display etc). one of the cool things about this is macos will keep your layout even between restarts.

additionally you may want to look at tweaking keyboard and trackpad shortcuts. for example if ctrl+left/right (for switching spaces) doesn't work for you you can rebind that to something else in keyboard system preferences. similarly you can get more mileage out of your trackpad gesture options via bettertouchtool.

also if like using spotlight search put a check next to 'when switching to an application, switch to an open space' in mission control system preferences.this will allow you to automatically jump to the space containing the most recently used instance of that app when you type the apps name in spotlight search.",1517843344.0

I’d say in general I try to make a desktop have all the tools I need for whatever task I’m working on.

The external monitor is as I said for communication. But sometimes I create an additional desktop for it. It might have a full screen safari on it that I use to look up information. Or if I need to reference text files I may have Sublime open or even just Mac’s TextEdit.

### I don't understand, why are you doing this? 

Before we worked with a white list we got a lot of spam on this subreddit, together with vote manipulation this caused the quality of the subreddit to go down. 

### How do I get this domain white-listed? 

We will always keep an eye on what domains get submitted, if a certain domain gets approved consistently we will add it to the white list. We also frequently ask the community to give feedback on the list, we do this through a monthly feedback thread.

	1. Execute the following terminal command:
		“sudo mv /Users/usernametohide /var/usernametohide”
	This command will move the user’s home directory to /var.

	2. Then we update the user record for the Administrator account to point to the 	new home path:
		“sudo dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser NFSHomeDirectory /var/hiddenuser”

	3. Lastly, we remove the Public Folder using the Administrator accounts “long 	name”:

If you have a Mac and want to do windows gaming then I strongly suggest boot camp, windows runs like lightening on the native Mac hardware.

Windows 10 is free and doesn’t require any $$, that is if you don’t want to personalise it and don’t mind a small watermark. 

For antivirus the built in firewall is perfect for home use, especially if your router is configured for NAT. For AV head to Sophos home. It’s free, cloud managed and great for home use.

If you want to run windows or Linux, but not games, then totally use VirtualBox, or if you have the $$ VMware fusion. If your Mac is fairly new then it will happily run alongside your Mac even with apps like Photoshop and Xcode running.

If you are on a Mac OS, and you want to use an older version of Mac OS as a virtual machine, I believe you can.

I'm able to store usernames and passwords but also credit cards, security questions, software licenses, and anything else that I don't need regular access to. On top of that, it's cross-platform so all the same passwords are accessible on my PC and my Android devices (along with all my iOS devices), and I just find the experience and UI to be better than Keychain, even for randomly generated passwords. I also like the ability to copy usernames/passwords easily, show them on-screen in larger font for when I have to type in a password on another computer or device (damn you PS4!).

I've used both extensively and 1Password will always get my vote.

I can go on holiday without stress, and an informed, intelligent client who’s aware you’re sharing info with them is a happy client.

AnugNef4,"The dictionary files can be restored from a Time Machine backup. I just did this on a High Sierra system. What I found by poking around is that the .dictionary files are stored in three directories in High Sierra:

* ~/Library/Dictionaries
* /Library/Dictionaries

The 3rd directory is where I found the .dictionary files in a Time Machine backup. I did not use Time Machine to restore them. Get into a Time Machine backup directory, then the .dictionary files live under /System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX inside of directories named with a hash.

## How do I get my submissions approved? 

To get your submission approved simply follow these steps: 

1. Make sure your submission follows the rules as found in [the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/macos/wiki/config/sidebar).
2. After making sure it follows the rules, **[message the moderators.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/MacOS&subject=Request to review this submission by /u/crazyrobert2017&message=I would like to have my submission reviewed: [macOS 10.13.4 beta 1 now available for Mac]( https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/7sp2nc/macos_10134_beta_1_now_available_for_mac/\))**

Before we worked with a white list we got a lot of spam on this subreddit, together with vote manipulation this caused the quality of the subreddit to go down. 

### How do I get this domain white-listed? 

We will always keep an eye on what domains get submitted, if a certain domain gets approved consistently we will add it to the white list. We also frequently ask the community to give feedback on the list, we do this through a monthly feedback thread.

At the time as a company we didn't want to move off of El Capitan, however because of the new file system they use with High Sierra my image of El Capitan would not work on the MacBook. I talked with Apple support and they said if I went to a Mac Store, they would remove whatever OS it came with and roll it back to a recent version of Mac OS for me. Problem with this is the nearest Mac Store to me is about a 3 hour drive. I played with it a bunch, did a ton of restores, safe boot, internet recovery and none of it would take and we had to live with one of our Macs on High Sierra. The problem is 100% the fact that High Sierra no longer uses the Journal file system and when to APFS.

neoookami,"For the most part, it’s really personal choice between the three. Some websites will work better in one or the other, so I have all three installed at any given time.

The three big considerations are integration, performance, and standards.

Safari is absolute king of integration. It connects with your Apple services and is going to support everything super smoothly. OS level sharing panel? Sure! Apple Pay? Of course! Syncing between your iPhone and iPad? Do you even have to ask? Performance tends to be great, especially battery life. Where it tends to fall a little shorter is web standards, but still tends to do extremely well. You’re more likely to hit a website with trouble on Safari than you would Chrome or Firefox, but it’s not terrible common. Extension selection tends to be far more limited, but still covers the essentially like adblocking. It’s the only “real” browser on your iOS devices too. Firefox and Chrome both have to use it’s engine, and can’t benefit from adblocking on the platform which stinks.

Chrome and Firefox tend to be a bit back and forth. These days I find myself preferring Firefox between the two. They had a big update towards the end of last year which included some major engine and UI refreshes. Personally I really like the changes, hence favoring it. It’s gotten great on battery life, and it’s standards compliance is top notch. Though you’ll get the best performance in Google apps in Chrome still. Especially things like Google Docs. Firefox also has the nice element of being a major player in pushing for a free and open internet, which is something I consider pretty important myself. 

I mostly use Safari at the end of the day, with Firefox being my preferred backup browser and preferred browser on non-Apple devices. But again, it’s really a matter of personal preference. Safari really isn’t going to be beaten on integration, but if you don’t care about that as much it’s a moot point. Chrome and Firefox are gonna keep taking turns as who’s the “best” between the two. So just use whichever you prefer. At the end of the day it’s not that hard to move your bookmarks between them if you change your mind.",1516588099.0

,"If you want a super secure & even a secret encryption, I use Veracrypt.  With that program, you can create a folder within a flash drive or HDD of any size and then pick many different encryption methods.  I use either 256AES or Serpent, then the program has you use the mouse and wave it around to create a key for it so no key is the same.  Small learning curve when starting out but youtube videos have you up and running in no time.

The reason I like this one the most is simply that if someone ever took your flash drive and plugged it in, they would have no idea what encryption method you used OR that it was even encrypted. A step beyond that, on a Mac you have to enter your password to even use the program to then enter another password to decrypt. So its pretty secure when it comes down to it.

sfsdfd,"I applied a clean install of High Sierra on my late-2011 MacBook Pro. Literally started with reformatting the drive.

Right off the bat, I had trouble: High Sierra absolutely could not complete a Time Machine backup. My setup is a little unusual - I backup my machines via Time Machine to a Synology NAS that is mounted as an AFP volume. It works fine and consistently well for four other MacOS devices, and it used to work for this MacBook Pro - but under High Sierra, it just could not complete a backup.

It ran OK for a few months, then started to exhibit odd glitches. Apps froze at random; keystrokes in Word were weirdly delayed; Chrome started refusing to run TinkerCad, ostensibly because TinkerCad requires WebGL, which spontaneously stopped working.

It got worse. Apps locked up. Kernel panics started occurring - and with alarming frequency. The machine started struggling to boot: about 3/4 of the way through the sequence, it just started over.

I tried to figure out the problem. I dug through the console logs (and, lo, they were many) to ID the problem. I compared my MBP's properties and software base and logs with those of other Macs that are also under High Sierra and are running fine. No dice.

Last week, I reached my limit. I reformatted the drive and started over from scratch. So far, it's been stable - which refutes any thoughts that it might be a hardware issue. Still, this is disturbing: I have no idea when my machine is going to throw the same fit again.

the_corvinus,"Ok, so... One of the interesting things about how the MacOS works is it stores customizations, changes and preferences for programs in system files called ""Plists"" or Preference lists. These are just coded text documents in your User Library. Sometimes these .plists get corrupted and cause weird problems. So, when that happens, you can find them and delete them. What this does is forces the Mac to rebuild the plist from scratch, fixing any problem caused by such corruption. Now, one thing to know: this WILL kill  any changes you've made to Contacts through the Preferences menu, so consider yourself warned.

Ok, to delete a plist you're going to first open your Finder and locate the ""Go"" menu at the top of the screen. You'll notice that ""Library"" does not appear. Now, hold down the ""Option"" key on your keyboard, and watch as the ""Library"" option, suddenly appears. This is Apple's way of protecting system files from accidental deletion by people who don't know what they're doing. You however, you are not one of those people, not anymore.

So, click on ""Library"" in the ""GO"" menu and then find ""Preferences"" You'll see a whole bunch of files, all starting with ""com"" in this case you're looking for ""com.apple.addressbook.plist"" (The old name for the contacts app) once you find that file. I want you to drag it to the trash. 

Once it is in the trash, restart your computer. Log back in, and see if the problem is resolved. Maybe try uploading a photo again and see if it stays.

Hopefully this helps, let me know either way.",1515962947.0

I suspect the sync feature (promised but not yet delivered) will purge messages from all devices when deleted from any. Currently, purge seems to only delete on the device that deleted it.

Anyway, two methods to get transcripts. 

1. Select the conversation (your name\number), then Edit > Select All, then Copy, an Paste into a Text, Word, Pages, etc document. This will not capture date\time stamps, but should give you the entire history. You might have to scroll to the top of all history to cache it into the app, it seems to cache only the last 10-20 dialogs initially, but just keep scrolling till you don't see any more history. Once pasted, you can go back through and manually insert dates and times into the document if that is important.

jon_hendry,"If such an app were to be discovered in the app store, Apple can send out something that automatically disables it from running. (Or possibly even deletes it, but don't quote me on that.)

I'd be more concerned about Javascript in the browser.

But there's no point in being anxious about it, because there isn't really anywhere to go to escape it, short of selling your Mac and buying a G4 iMac or something similarly old.

Or you could buy a new Raspberry Pi 3, which are immune to the issue. On the plus side, they're only about $50. On the minus side, they run Linux, so you'd have to be okay with learning that.

Just hope that OS and browser updates make it harder or impossible to exploit those bugs, hope that CPU designers find a way to design future chips to block such attacks without giving up much peformance, and hope that those CPUs come out and appear in Mac hardware quickly.",1515821893.0

So the short answer is no.  Even if Apple were 100% perfect at keeping out the exploits in app store apps, that's not the only entryway for an attack.

What you need to do is keep your OS up to date. Apple has updated iOS11 and macOS High Sierra so that its latest versions mitigate meltdown and spectre, at least to some extent.  There may be more mitigations coming, so installing updates as they come is your best defense.

Apple also updated Safari for macOS Sierra. That should be installed as well where applicable, and if a user is running a different browser, they're going to need to keep those updated, too.

If you're OS is up to date, that's the really the best you can do.  I wouldn't go so far as to say ""don't worry about it,"" because security vulnerabilities are found all the time. These updates probably will not be the end of the story.  So, update, and be watchful for more when they come.

On the macOS side, I don't think restricting to solely the App Store is feasible anyway, unless you also want to say goodbye to Adobe Creative Suite and Microsoft Office.

So typically yes - there is a copy that is editable on your drive taking up space even when offline.

For Apple iCloud there are ways to optimize your storage.  See this article
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206996

For Google backup and sync - you have to chose what you want to sync down if you need to free up space.  Probably the easiest workflow is to have a folder called something like work in your google drive - then only sync that folder to save space.  Put your active working files into that directory.  When you are done - use the drive web app to shuffle files into backup folders in the cloud.  These backup folders are not synced hence not taking up space on your SSD.  (There are other ways to do this but this is a simple example that works with most cloud based storage)  ",1515682528.0
zenmaster24,"$cloud could be either syncing (in which case the data is stored on your mba and the cloud is a backup), or storage (in which case you are opening files from a cloud location, and the data is not stored on your mba). i think icloud is a sybncing cloud, and google drive is a storage cloud, but has syncing capability?",1515644740.0
anazhd,"If you want to save space, you should try CloudMounter, Expandrive, Mountainduck or Webdrive. It mounts the cloud drive like a normal or network drive so you can stream the file when you need it. Using iCloud itself is just a cloud sync, where the files on computer and cloud are synced so it matches.

Same goes to Google Drive, unless you have Gsuite like I do, so you can use the Google Drive File Stream,  (kinda same like those 4 services I mentioned before). But GDFS is nowhere near perfect, I have 1.5gb of work files on the cloud and GDFS keep cache around 1.1gb on my macbook. So, skip this.

My personal favourite so far is Expandrive, it cost you money, but it works and fast, at least on my network. ",1515739285.0
dewisew,"Lots of the posters so far have been correct about clients syncing your files and wasting space on your harddrive. I use Webdrive, which actually doesn't sync.

piggahbear,"So i'm learning about this area currently. When I mount my samba share it mounts as a /Volumes sub-dir and same when using an app like Expandrive, which honestly is a nice tool. When I use SSHFS I typically just Mount to ~/Sites/machine1 and the only problem I ever have with permissions is that root ssh is usually disabled so I'm mounting as a user but that leaves me unable to mess with anything that user doesnt own. Ive messed with sftp umask and stuff but no luck on that front. I would assume if you mount to /mnt/dir your permissions issues would just be related to those on the remote system.

wesley_wyndam_pryce,"posting this comment of mine that may be helpful to you:

I noticed some users in [this Apple Support post](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8086777?start=15&tstart=0) have said that using a terminal command to clear up LOCAL time machine snapshots first seemed to avoid the ""Your disk could not be partitioned"" error.

That's not ideal because you might very well want to keep your time machine snapshots.  However, if you don't mind them being deleted, you can try the approach described in the link above, which I will note here:

the commands are:

    tmutil listlocalsnapshots /

which should show you if you have any on your local disk.

and if you wish to wipe them:

    tmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 9999999999999999

which will REMOVE all local snapshots.

I don't know if those commands will help you - some users report that helping and the bootcamp assistant partitioning succeeding after doing the above. For myself, I encounter the same ""your disk could not be partitioned"" problem even after using the terminal commands above.

We evaluated Sierra, but several of our tools and workflows that have been solid as a rock for years (if not a decade) were unpredictably unreliable on 10.12. We're still hearing so many howls of pain from High Sierra guinea pigs that we're loath to join them unless absolutely forced to. Apple may force us to do so for the subset of Macs that support 10.13 and, in doing so, force us to internally support and switch among OS versions on a daily basis for the first time since Mac OS Classic.~~

~~Deliberately destroying customer goodwill, confidence, and satisfaction in this manner has hurt Apple before and will continue to do so again. Personally, this formerly effusively evangelical Apple user, developer, and shareholder is paying close attention to alternatives going forward.~~

The entry documenting this, the first for _Kernel_ in the list, was not documented until *4 January 2018,* the day after Meltdown was publicly disclosed. Any security-conscious user or shop running El Capitan (10.11.6) or later releases of OS X/macOS should have this security update installed already and is therefore, apparently, protected against Meltdown as well as they can be at present. I have little doubt that Apple will release another Security Update if they determine that OS X 10.13.2 or Security Updates 2017-002/2017-005 are not sufficient mitigation of the problem. As everyone has noted, this does nothing against Spectre (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715).

wasabipimpninja,"I am not sure how MacOS is affected by this, from what I've read on OSX Internals the memory layout is totally different from NT and Linux. The kernel resides in its own Virtual Address space. Generally Operating systems split the Virtual Address Space in half (other splits exists such as 3/1, normally 2/2 was common). With the kernel mapped into every process in the upper half of the Virtual Address Space. 

In macOS this is totally not true, a small SHIM exists in Virtual address Space which traps any calls, then does a whole process swap, and moves to the kernel Virtual Address Space. 
So in NT and Linux a rogue process can probe the VA and use this exploit to map what parts of the TLB is loaded, and possibly find the Pagetable address to exploit with something like RowHammer, OSX if you do this you'll only end up in the SHIM. The big problem with this exploit is because the NT and Linux kernels are shared and mapped across every process you can poke/probe the address space and find potential information as to what exists there, however in OSX thats already in its own totally different address space.

Swapping from the process VA to the OSX VA kills and flushes all TLB information, the only useful intelligence in OSX that this exploit could find its the processes own pagetable, do damage to it self? 
The fixes the Linux and NT teams seem to be doing is something macOS already does since day 1 of release, place the critical bits of the OS in its own address space.

jdickey,"Why is El Cap a ""prison""? Our shop skipped Sierra entirely, and our experiments with High Sierra have also uniformly failed; the tools and workflows we depend on every single day are simply too unreliable to be trusted. On El Capitan, as with every release since Puma (save Mavericks, which we also skipped), they're solid as a rock and we're productive.

I've commented *many* times (just on Reddit in the last year, highlights include [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/5pg2hr/rant_this_is_the_buggiest_hardwaresoftware_apple/dcr71p4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/5ue5vm/tim_cook_has_tweeted_from_his_iphone_75_times_and/ddtm3uy/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/61gkp1/im_switching_to_ubuntu_full_time_from_macos_and/dfekc4a/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/639n4z/macos_10124_vs_os_x_10116/dfswgq7/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/7afffi/as_of_now_should_i_upgrade_el_capitan_to_high/dpa54bp/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/7g9zuc/owc_aura_ssd_not_compatible_with_high_sierra/dqhpeq1/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/7jk6vz/should_i_upgrade_ive_heard_some_troubling_things/dr82yeh/)) about my worry/rage/disgust with current Apple trends; Apple are trying to make themselves into a new luxury marque and I'm not at all confident that it's going to work over the long term.

Burning bridges with the Mac community, which historically has saved Apple *at least* twice, seems not unlike the metaphorical whistling past the graveyard; you don't want to fall into any unexpected holes.

hollyjester,"First off, there is a difference between your current battery percentage and the lifecycle count of the battery. The whole iPhone fiasco deals with the latter. The MacBooks have twice the lifecycle limit of an iPhone battery, and it is generally a slower process to add cycles to your laptop battery than your phone.

The kind of throttling (at a software level) that was introduced for the iPhones is to deal with random shutdowns typically frequent in colder temperatures due to a battery past the lifecycle limit. That kind of throttling does not exist on macOS, though it may for watchOS.

You are more likely to experience CPU throttling from the power management unit when your current battery percentage is low. Or more typical for a MacBook is thermal throttling due to inadequate cooling. But this level of throttling has existed in every computer since voltage and frequency scaling was technically possible, so I don’t think it merits any kind of warning or explanation.

euclid15,Yep. I had to do a couple hard reboots today because of this. I was just trying to move some files around on my old Mac hosting a shared drive. My current laptop that was connected to the share would just lock up. Force quitting and restarting the Finder wouldn’t get me anywhere. After 2 reboots I ended up just screen-sharing and moving the files without going through SMB. All because I didn’t want to get up and walk over to the old Mac...,1514425507.0
psycho--the--rapist,"Hey OP, thought I would let you know of some success I had today, which may be worth you trying, if you're still struggling. 

In short the answer was to force SMB 2, instead of 3. 

Depending on the page you visit, it is extremely common (as I found today) to be given completely wrong information on how to go about this. Most pages will tell you that the relevant setting within /etc/nsmb.conf should be: ""smb_neg=smb2_only"". I tried this several times and Finder was still crashing so I had assumed it was not the answer.

However after some testing (mainly using the command 'smbutil statshares -a' to verify) I found the Mac I was working on was actually still using SMB v3.02. After some further reading and experimentation, I found the format of the setting had changed, to: ""protocol_vers_map=2"". Believe it or not this is not even detailed in the relevant man pages, which indicate you can disable SMB1, or SMB1&2, but not 3. However, after implementing the above, rebooting, and verifying using smbutil, I found all my issues went away (pending further testing of course!)

Here is the best page I have found to mirror the success I had: https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/22215/etc-nsmb-conf-changes-in-macos-10-12-sierra

I really hope this helps you because it's really frustrating!

sandblazer,"After getting escalated up an Apple support call chain multiple times over the course of 80 minutes I found out that the issue lies with the SMB implementation in High Sierra not respecting ACLs, thus causing the flaky behavior. The last tech I spoke with said there were even problems when they tested it Mac-to-Mac and Mac-to-Linux.

It figures that after months of waiting on a fix that the time I would finally get impatient and give them a call is when they would release the fix just a few days prior. 

Essentially yesterday I reported this problem occurring on 10.13.3 and the answer essentially was: ""Oh, we just fixed that in 10.13.4 which was released in the last 7 days.""

Here is the release notes page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208533. They drew my attention to the bullet under ""Enterprise Content"" which mentions: ""Properly evaluates ACLs on SMB share points"".

They acknowledged the workarounds everyone was doing by downgrading the protocol version (which is bad practice, but left people with little choice), but said it was an ACL problem which is no longer in their bug tracker system as an active item to be fixed, implying Apple thinks they've fixed it with this 10.13.4 release. I upgraded last night and am watching the host today to see how it behaves with SMBv3 accessing some of our shares.",1522771824.0

tubezninja,"Well, there's actually quite a few different things out there all saying that they're UNIX, so you'll really have to define what your starting point is, exactly.  You've probably already seen [this lineage chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg) that shows where a lot of modern *NIX based ones were derived from.  [There's also this version.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Unix_timeline.en.svg)

To say that Linux is ""based on UNIX"" is a bit misleading.  It's UNIX-*like*, in that it closely resembles how UNIX works in many cases, but anyone involved in its development will steadfastly deny it ever having a single line of UNIX code.

Meanwhile, the macOS kernel (and derivatives: iOS, tvOS, watchOS, etc.) traces its lineage from the BSD family of UNIX-based operating systems.  So there is a clearer direct relation to UNIX there.

Certainly, there's been changes.  I mean, UNIX is starting to push 50 years old, and the original Bell Labs UNIX continued development even after the branch-off that eventually leads to macOS, meaning there's some divergence.  But you'll definitely find closer correlations at the code level to UNIX on macOS, than you will on linux.",1514417691.0

jon_hendry,"It's correct. That's just the Mach name for Intel architecture CPUs generally. It's been that way since NeXTSTEP which never ran on 386.

The 64 bit distinction is only important when using the arch command to run a particular architecture binary in a fat binary, if there are both 32 bit and 64 bit Intel binaries in it and you wanted to run the 32 bit architecture on a machine that would normally default to running the 64 bit.

The arch binary itself has both 32 bit and 64 bit executables:
/usr/bin/arch: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64] [i386:Mach-O executable i386]
/usr/bin/arch (for architecture x86_64):	Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
/usr/bin/arch (for architecture i386):	Mach-O executable i386

2) Wipe NVRAM: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063

I've also deleted the sleepimage, thinking it might be corrupt:
In order to do that in High Sierra, you need to disable System Integrity Protection by launching a Terminal in Recovery Mode and typing: csrutil disable
I've removed the image in Recovery Mode as well:
To do so, I mounted my Harddrive in Disk Utility (still in Recovery mode) and navigated to the location of the sleep image there.

I've also let OnyX do all maintenance, I could think of.

This leads me to think that it comes ready to go without me doing anything to it, I'd hate to format it and choose some option that wasn't what it was built for. 

The video instructions online don't answer this question because they show the old version, the NON PRO version, which you did in fact have to format, it did not require High Sierra or APFS. 

I picked the pro version, which was only 50 more dollars because I watched YouTube videos of people with the same MacBook I have that were getting read and write speeds of 1100 write and 1300 read. Which is INSANE. 

Right now I get about 500 write and 850 read, which is already blazing fast.

However, I wanted to start fresh and wanted 1TB of internal storage. 

I wonder how fast you can go using external boot drives in the OWC Thunderbolt drive bay's. I know they will use III 2.5 SSD's and although external because they are ESATA to Thunderbolt 2 it's as if you had an internal one.

AaWw101,"I've had my share of issues with High Sierra. For me, Mac Mail has been especially bad, getting worse and worse over the years. Pre-High Sierra releases, I noticed straight out bugs in Mail -- weird ""reply all"" behavior, email sorting bugs, search never working right. With High Sierra, Mail is now super slow, with a lot of the bugs still in place.

The slow speeds with Mail may be because I do a horrible job of keeping my inboxes clean and organized (thousands and thousands of messages in multiple accounts carried over since I came back to Mac in 2008), but you'd think a modern OS and mail client could handle this. So, I finally made the switch to Airmail 3 last night, something more modern, but now I have to deal with the learning curve. Email basics with Airmail are fine, but I need to learn all of the little ""hidden"" features.

A couple of other places I've run into problems with High Sierra:

1) Disk Utility -- First Aid
I have 10.13.3, and First Aid hangs every time ... I can't Force Quit, so I have to do a hard reboot. I want to run First Aid every month, really as an early warning system, in case there are problems with my main drive.

2) Safari ...
Random slowdowns here too. Trying to Quit sometimes stalls out, requiring a Force Quit. Ugh.

Parallels has a lot of features that balance VM performance over native environment performance. Plenty of room to tweak.

Now - I really wouldn't run ""other Office programs"" on your Mac. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and a bunch of others are available as native Mac applications. Running those will not only be more efficient and appropriate for your Mac, they'll definitely reduce the computational load of Parallels.

It works fluidly and offers the latest and greatest features in terms of compatibility with my iOS devices and Watch (unlock feature). 

If you enjoy Mavericks, you’ll definitely love High Sierra’s new Features (considering you haven’t used the newer features on the other versions like Yosemite, El Capitan and Sierra).

benji,"No answers but confirming I get this too. Taking it further, with adobe apps on High Sierra I've managed to get a ""workspace switch loop"" going. Swapping to one app causes it to swap to another workspace, where it then focuses something else which causes it to swap back to the first workspace. Over and over until I do something to stop it. Adobe apps seem to struggle with multiple workspaces. Microsoft apps behave differently again.

rant: I don't understand what Apple was going for with window focus and workspaces, the way it behaves makes no sense to me. Not just on High Sierra, it's always been this way. I want to be able to setup a workspace for an app, and have all of that apps windows live within that workspace, and cmd-tab to that app, would swap to the workspace it's in and bring it to the top of other windows. Instead they made it apps can span multiple workspaces, so cmd-tab simply makes the app active, but doesn't swap workspaces or raise the window unless you're already in it's workspace. The way it works currently, cmd-tab switching does different things if you are in the same workspace as application than if you're in a different one.

I work with 7-8  apps open all day, frequently swapping between them to do my job. My pain is the actual action of swapping between apps breaks my concentration on the task I'm working on. Swapping between 2 apps in one workspace with cmd-tab is generally ok, but once you go past using 2 apps or try to use workspces to organize things, MacOS gets in the way and demands you pay it attention making impossible do the simple task of swapping to a program #3 without thinking about it. Slow expose and workspace switching animations, further add delays which break concentration. ",1513457299.0

,"VPN is always going to make you more secure, especially with everything going on with Net Neutrality, but let’s put that aside for a second and give yourself a scenario

Say you are on a bus, and you decide “shit, great time to check my bank statement, no one is around and I kinda wanna see how rich I am”, so you go to your mobile banking app, or even worse, their webpage. Now their Webpage will be HTTPS, which is secure to a point, but still can’t stop a hacker that’s nearby you. You type in your information, and that hacker is like “Merry Christmas to you too, steals your info, and buys the new iPhone X off your credit card, or buys Bitcoin, converts to Monero, and switches back to Bitcoin and now no one can trace where that money went.

Say you had a VPN turned on (NordVPN is the best hands down, next is PIA), all that information you typed in goes through a “tunnel”, an encrypted tunnel that makes it so that no one can see what you are doing on your phone. Hackers nearby can’t, your ISP just knows you are using Data, the only people that know are you and the VPN provider. This is also something to think about at work. I work as an IT Security analyst and run through logs of data to see where the internet is being used and we will block websites (Facebook, YouTube, stuff that doesn’t need to eat up our data, so that our internet is being used for what it should be, work. If it’s slowing down our internet speed and it’s not crucial to work, it’s getting blocked) with a VPN, they bypass this, unless they block the port your VPN is running off of, usually this doesn’t happen, because most work computers have a VPN, but if it does Nord still has a way to do this (I believe it’s obfsoculate, fudged the word up), but what it does is basically makes it look like you aren’t on a VPN. China blocks all VPN’s, so does North Korea, so this is used in those areas to bypass that. TOR is also a good internet browser to install for being anonymous. Usually you should download this with a VPN turned on, as the government is opposed to free speech, and hate TOR, but it’s perfectly legal.  

Now I recommended two, and the reason is they keep no logs, so all that info you just stored, it doesn’t get saved anywhere, it’s like you are entering it into a shredder. You can save the passwords and stuff to the phone or to LassPass, but the encrypted information is basically being shredded once you are done pulling or sending the information.

Totally speculating here, but if everything you've described is accurate, it's possible you have something running that's allowing remote connections. A quick way to check is to open a terminal and do *sudo lsof -Pi | grep LISTEN* [1]. After you enter your password, it'll show you a list of everything that's currently waiting for incoming connections. Not saying this will definitely expose something, but maybe you'll get lucky.

My suggestion would be:

1. Save your documents somewhere safe, eg removable hard drive
2. Save them again somewhere else, eg iCloud, Google Drive etc.
3. Make sure you saved them, right? Don't forget photos, documents, music and video that you might want to keep.
4. Make a time-machine backup, this is for insurance only, don't restore from it since it may still contain malware/spyware programs and settings that you don't want to keep. 

Do these next steps somewhere where you have good internet, as you will be downloading 5-10GB.

5. Follow the [reinstallation steps](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904) - be sure to reformat your startup disk, this will completely erase and reset it back to factory - zapping any malware in the process.
6. Install your applications again, be careful about the sources. Eg, don't install any pirated software downloaded from dodgy websites. Especially since this could compromise your security. Only install software obtained from legitimate locations. Also, don't install those ""[purple monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BonziBuddy)""-like software, they often carry a lot of spyware baggage with them.

First of all, you need to disable SIP, otherwise you won't be able to copy anything to the Core Services folder. Then after you've gone through all the steps listed above, you additionally need to copy over a file from Sierra called NetworkDiagnosticsUI from /System/Library/CoreServices/Network Diagnostics.app/Contents/MacOS/Network Diagnostics to the corresponding folder in High Sierra. Otherwise Network Diagnostics will just crash the second you try opening it.

This is what I did and what worked for me. Network Diagnostics is currently running for me without any issues on High Sierra, as you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/CtizQ).

Edit: Forgot to mention that I installed Sierra on a small partition of my drive. That way I didn't have to erase everything just to get those files. I didn't even try getting them from the installer itself, so I don't know if that would work.",1513118136.0

Petelero,"If you’re a power user, don’t bother.

I’m working in a production company that uses Macs. We’re having mostly the 2013 Thrash Cans plus a couple of Mid 2012 Tower MacPros running legacy applications and hardware.

The Thrash Cans are running at 32gb configurations and the old Xeon E5 processors. So I’m running Yosemite on these Thrash Cans. Yosemite has proven to be pretty stable and fast compared to El Capitan and Sierra.

We also have iMacs and those iMacs are running on Yosemite as well. I had to bring some El Capitan and Sierra machines down to Yosemite due to severe performance issues. We’re handling TBs and TBs of video footage that needs to be processed on the fly most of the time.

I’ve noticed this trend of OSes becoming increasing power hungry. Yosemite was able to perform on 4gb. On EL Capitan 4gb setups could barely make it and 8gb was unstable. Sierra was the complete destruction of 4gb setups. 8gb setups could barely run properly. All the above setups I’ve mentioned are running on SATA drives. Even on SSDs, with EL Capitan and Sierra, we observed a similar drop in performance and stability as well. Performance levels are exponential to your hardware configs.

I’d strongly advise you against installing High Sierra on your 2009 mbp. In order to get decent performance, you need to have at least 16gb or RAM and running SSDs as your main boot drive.

If I use a browser I use it in fullscreen to declutter my desktop and because it's the app I spend by far the most time in. Since it's native, everything just works SO nicely in fullscreen on macOS. I think Maxon is the single other browser on the web that supports a non-overlapping menubar when you move the cursor to the top for that rare feature you need hidden in the menus. When clicking on a mail notification it splits my fullscreen browser to the left and the e-mail to the right. PERFECT for a quick read without leaving my fullscreen app. The screen space used for Safari's interface is very minimal compared to others. I don't have a favourites bar because it pops up when I click the url textfield. There's a single button that slides open my reading list from the side for pages I saved for later.

,"I have used all three extensively and recently went back to Chrome. I prefer Safari over Firefox for better performance, but Safari's bookmark management features and pop-up control features are not up to par. Additionally, as you've seen with extension support, developers kind of ignore Safari or leave out key features in their extensions that they add into extensions for other browsers. Also, apps I use for work that run in a browser are often not supported in Safari.

It's a shame really because Safari is a great browser and performs better than FireFox. FireFox feels heavy to me. Safari makes better use of screen space and definitely runs faster than FireFox, even its newest version. I could just never get comfortable in the FireFox world.

Safari in its newest version has great controls over tracking and individual website permission control, such as location access and notifications, that will allow you to decide how each website can interact with you and your computer. I find this function in Safari to be better than the others. Safari can also access the keychain so if you use websites for work that use basic authentication, you can store those credentials and access them with Safari, which others can't.

Having said all that, I found that Chrome has more extensions, broader support from developers, better bookmark and pop-up management features, and is probably a little faster than Safari, though that's hard to fully discern because Safari renders pages in a different way the Chrome. So, for all that, I've gone back to Chrome. For me, Safari's advantages don't overcome it's weaknesses.

Sorry if that's not the answer you were looking for, but I've spent some time on this subject and thought my experience might be helpful. It's really a personal choice so finding any one definitive opinion may be a challenge.

I was going to update this month, but your post and others make me I think I should leave it for a couple of months more. Maybe longer. I don’t know if I will really notice any major improvements anyway.
