seb59,"Prior using any control technic, it's good to identify its strengths and weaknesses. Although this can ends up in a troll battle, my point is that fuzzy system are just a way to represent a non linear function. It's a great modeling tool, well suited to formulate rules using 'human' understandable rules.
If you don't have any prior knowledge on how to control your system, then other methods could be better suited. Neural network may sometimes be easier to to tune. 

Whatever, it's better to provides your controller with relevant info.  In  your case, why don't you try using the frequency and the amplitude has input to your fuzzy control.?

seb59,"Several hints:
MATLAB is mostly a software that deals with numeric computation. In general, there is no trivial way to compute the integral of a function. You may uses the symbolic toolbox to compute the analytical expression of the integral. But it is subject to severe restriction  (the integral must be solvable). You may also decide to use a numerical integration. This method will provides an approximation of the result but will definitively more general.

So your problem may be solved using Matlab (or may other software) but you should be more specific about what kind of result is expected

If the integral to be computed is int(mx, dx) then the primitive is 0.5m.x^2+cte. The problem is then trivial since it's expression is known ",1543617763.0

angrmgmt00,"Practice!  If you want to get good at anything, and you're like most of us (i.e. you're not a savant), you have to work at it.  It's good that you've taken a course, because having direction for your practice can be very helpful.  To that end there are also resources online that can guide you in studying MATLAB, several of which are featured in the sidebar of this sub (to the right --->).  My favorite among those is MATLAB Cody, and specifically the [Cody Challenge](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/problems?term=group%3A%22Cody+Challenge%22&sort=created+asc), which teaches you how to solve specific problems using MATLAB features.

For more general coding assistance, there are over a billion results for a Google search on ""how to write code"", which is overwhelming (despite most of the results being distinctly *underwhelming*).  It can be tough to pick out the good stuff from the bad, and tougher to know where to start.  However, there are some fundamentals that you can learn about (essentially the modules in any introductory programming course) that  make it easier to get good help:

1. [Variables](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/create-and-edit-variables.html) and Basic Data Structures
2. [Control Flow](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/control-flow.html) Statements ([Loops](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/loop-control-statements.html) and [Conditionals](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/conditional-statements.html))
3. [Functions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/function-basics.html) (aka Methods; MATLAB has many already made for you, like the sum function and the sine function, etc.) and [Operators](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/operators-and-elementary-operations.html)
4. [Objects](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/object-oriented-programming.html) (this is at the upper end of the basics, and might be something to hold off on for now)

Each of these topics is crucial to understanding programming in general ([object-oriented programming](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/object-oriented-programming.html), specifically), and breaking the whole topic down to these four elements can help you make the task of understanding easier.

With those in mind, the process of writing a program becomes easier to understand.  You need some way to store both input and output data (item 1), you need to do things with that data (item 3), you need to direct when and how many times to do those things  (item 2), and when you're ready, you can combine some of the previous 3 items into 'classes', which are the cookie cutters for objects (item 4).

Do you have any specific trouble with any of the four things I listed?  Is there a specific problem you'd like help with?  Read some of the links I gave you, and if you're struggling with something, make a new post asking about it.  Lots of people here want to help you, but it's easier to answer more specific questions!",1543595340.0

So defining the problem myself, trying out code, looking at file exchange and matlab functions, and testing what they do by writing minimal working examples, and then moving on from there.

Weed_O_Whirler,"Writing code is problem solving much like solving a physics problem or a math word problem is problem solving- you're just letting a computer do a bunch of the math for you so you don't have to do it by hand. And whenever you're problem solving, normally the hardest part is figuring out what you have to do, not necessarily doing it. 

Whenever I'm starting a new MATLAB function, I always do the same thing- I start by just writing comments, and then writing calls to sub-functions which don't even exist yet- just defining their inputs and outputs, and then writing those sub-functions. Let's say I had time-tagged position measurements, and I wanted to function which estimated the velocity of the particle at the measurement times by fitting the position measurements to a  ""degree n"" polynomial, and then taking the derivative. I would do something like this:


    function vel = estimate_vel(t, pos, deg_n)
    % check if the input data is valid
    % fit the position data to a polynomial, degree n
    % take the derivative of the polynomail
    % evaluate the derivative at time t

Then, after I wrote that part, I would fill in sub-functions under neath each comment, thinking about the inputs and outputs I'd need. For instance, what do I need to check to see if the inputs are valid? Well, I need to know that `t` and `pos` are the same length, and I need to make sure that the length of the inputs are at least `deg_n + 1` otherwise, I can't do a polynomail fit of the points. If either of these conditions are false, I want to show an error message and exit out of the program. So, I would do something like:

    % check if the input data is valid
    is_valid = check_validity(length(t), length(p), deg_n)
    if ~is_valid
        disp('Error: Input data is not valid');
        vel = NaN;
        return;
    end

Then, I'd do this for all of the the comment blocks, and only after that do I start to write those sub-functions. 

Resist the urge to start writing code right away. Make sure you do everything else first before you start writing. Once the code is organized and all your inputs/outputs are defined, often times the code itself comes easy.

CuriousCutlet,"This problem can be formulated as a simple integer linear program (ILP) and solved using MATLAB's `intlinprog`. Let `f` be the vector of given integers, and `c` the limit. The decision variables is a vector `x` of same length as `f`, with value `1` indicating that the integer in the corresponding position from `f` is selected and `0` indicating that it is not selected. The optimization problem to solve is then,

        max f'x
    st: f'x <= c
        x ∈ {0, 1}

where `f'` indicates the transpose of the column vector `f`. In MATLAB, this can be solved as:

    f = [ <your input column vector> ];
    c = <your upper bound on the sum>;
    intcon = 1:length(f);      % all decision variables are integers
    lb = zeros(1, length(f));  % lower bound on x
    ub = ones(1, length(f));   % upper bound on x
    A = f';                     % inequality constraint matrix
    b = c;                     % upper bound on the sum
    % Solve the optimization problem
    x = intlinprog(-f, intcon, A, b, [], [], lb, ub)

You can read the documentation for `intlinprog` [here](https://in.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/intlinprog.html) for more information. The advantage of this approach is that it can easily be scaled for any length of the input vector and any arbitrary value `c`. The disadvantage is that it will find *only one* optimal solution, whereas like /u/Morton_Fizzback rightly noted your problem can have potentially multiple optimal solutions. If you wish to find all of the integer optimal solutions, you might have to use a commercial optimization solver like Gurobi/CPLEX.",1543668440.0
Morton_Fizzback,"First of all, it seems like you often will have more than one combination of elements that will give you your maximum especially since your vector contains only integers.   
Anyway, my guess would be to use C=combnk(v,k) in a loop over k. This takes you input vector v, and gives you all the different combinations of choosing k elements from v. Then for each k you calculate the sum of C (along the second dimension). Lets call this sumC. Then you set all vales of sumC larger than 10 to 0 (sumC(sumC>10)=0). And then you find the max of sumC (maxsumC) as well of the index (or indices if there's more than one combination giving you the max). You do this for each k from 1 to length(v), and then you find the max of the maxsumC and that's you answer for the maximum (probably exactly equal to 10, since you're working integers). Then lastly you need to have saved for which k's and for which rows of C (for the given k) you got your max, and that should give you your answer.",1543572692.0

jamaicamonjimon,"I was an intern with EDG (Engineering Development Group) last year, and now work full-time there.

**Interview Process (EDG):**

The interview process for EDG is similar for both intern and full-time positions. There is normally a technical phone interview along with some general questions regarding your interests and background. For full-time positions, this phone interview is followed up with a set of onsite interviews. The technical interviews have a strong focus on critical thinking and communication skills.

**Internship (EDG):**

As an intern in EDG, you are assigned to a specific development team based on your interests. You are invited to all of the team meetings, and will work closely with a mentor to complete a project. These projects take approximately 3 months to complete.

As an intern, you will learn about, but will not provide, technical support. Your only deliverable is the project.

**Full-time (EDG):**

The full-time EDG position is a little different since your time is split half-and-half between technical support and project work. You work in a month-long rotation: two weeks of support followed by two weeks of project work.

I like technical support for many reasons, but here are some of the most important ones:

1. The people - I am surrounded by incredibly smart people around my age. A large number of my colleagues in EDG are subject-matter experts with Masters or PhDs.
2. The problems - I get to work on and solve incredibly interesting issues that customers are facing. Almost every case teaches me something new about MATLAB, which will be invaluable once I transfer to a development team permanently.

I also like the project work, because I get to choose projects based on my interests. As the name suggests, EDG is all about development - the projects are a great opportunity to develop skills ranging from a specific programming language like C++ or JavaScript, to domain-knowledge in areas like compilers and automatic code generation.

Once you find a team that's a good fit for you, you transfer onto the team permanently. This normally occurs after 1-2 years of joining, with the average being 1.5 years.

As a side note, most people in EDG transfer to development roles, but you are able to transfer into any position in the company. Some people transfer to Sales, others become QEs (quality engineers) - it's your choice.

**Company Culture:**

In terms of the company culture, I think that it's pretty great. Everyone that I've spoken with has been more than happy to sit down with me and talk, whether it's to discuss potential projects or to walk me through how to solve a problem. If I had to pick one word to describe the environment, it would be ""collaborative"".

[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating\_guis/share-data-among-callbacks.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/share-data-among-callbacks.html)

I prefer to update the callback so that it includes additional parameters, but there are complications to that, which I was lucky enough to learn the fun way.  One example is:

`slider.Callback = @(src, event) slider_callback(src, event, data_obj);`

But the `data_obj` has to be a handle class so that you can update it as the program goes along.  Otherwise it gets sent to the callback by value; and, that value never updates.  That could be fine, like if the `data_obj` were instead a struct that contained handles to other objects... etc. etc.  That's kinda how they do it in GUIDE.  If you look at a callback function signature there's an extra handles parameter that gets passed into every callback function, and you'll have the callback set up to be something like:

`@(hObject,eventdata)FileName('slider_Callback',hObject,eventdata,guidata(hObject))`

To explain your current behavior, note any code’s right side is fully evaluated before any assignments are made to the left:

>A(ind) + increment

>[1,2,3]

Then this 1x3 array is assigned sequentially to the left side:

>A(1)=1

>A(1)=2

>A(1)=3

Hence A(2) & A(3) are unchanged and left at 0

Note, even though “true” & “1” look the same in MATLAB’s output and act the same in “if” statements, they behave differently for referencing/assignment. For example:

>ind1=[true,true,true]

When you call with `ind = [1, 1, 1]`, it is just the first index three consecutive times (which assigns in turn, `0+1`, `0+2`, and then `0+3`, which is what remains).  If you just want the sum of `increment` at positions denoted by your index vector to be assigned to A, you can just multiply:

    A = zeros(1, 3);
    ind = ones(1, 3); % include zeros if/where appropriate
    increment = 1:3;
    A = ind*increment.'; % zeros will multiply out values you don't need

If you want to add increment to A in all positions, you can just add the scalar to A, and it will auto-size.

Of course you can re-use the same names of you want, but it might make it harder for people to do searches for information on your project since they will get swamped with results for unrelated things.

Most language package distribution systems I know, including pip, npm, cran, and ctan, have the programming language somewhere in the name.  So to make it easier to discover and remember you might want to follow a similar pattern.

Regarding the software itself, this can be very helpful.  A couple of questions:

   1. Does it handle dependencies recursively?  So if your package depends on package A, and package A uses your project to depend on package B, does package B get pulled in?

Judonoob,"So, this was a ballsy question as it looks at Matlab as ""the cup is half empty"" viewpoint. 

Matlab is where I got my foundation for mathematical programming. So for me, matlab makes sense. I've branched out since then to R and Python, but in terms of ease and documentation, it continues going downhill.

The one thing you mentioned was incompatibility struck me as extremely puzzling. I'd argue that compatibility is one of Matlabs strongest suits. Matlabs foundation is built on C and Java. I don't work for the company, so I can only imagine most of the functions that become deprecated and replaced are due to backend improvements. 

Pythons best plotting package, Matplotlib has documentation that leaves much to be desired. Case in point: I spent roughly 20 hours trying to plot a timeseries that after a tremendous amount of troubleshooting, came down to an old version of both Pandas and Matplotlib not playing well with eachother. When I say old, the versions were only about a year old. That doesnt happen with Matlab.  

Packages with Matlab can be a little frustrating and gimmicky at times. For me, vanilla matlab and the statistics and machine learning toolbox are all I need. But for anything deep learning related, Tensorflow and Keras are my bread and butter. 

I think you have to do what I did going from Matlab to Python, and that is accept the differences for what they are, and live with it. Matlab is fundamentally powerful and easy to use. Python is fundamentally flexible and open source.

>SeismicAltop,


>Matlab has established its footing well for the last 35 years so.  Matlab is based on old government funded projects on linpack, eispack, and others in 60s and 70s for solving dynamic systems' problems.  It has built its momentum and followers.  Academia and industy adopted Matlab to solve numerical and dynamic systems with all the convenience of plotting features embedded.  Python is a late comer, borrowed lots of features from Matlab.  You can see much similarity in NumPy, Matplotlib, and others libraries.  


>Some schools teach object-oriented Python as the first programming language.  ECE community still considers C as a primary language for embedded system designs.  Matlab is a closed system so it is maintained consistently bu Mathworks.  Python and libraries may be not well maintained since these are open sources, that is, lots of frustration when the function calls are different in different versions.

mathisfakenews,"Matlab has quite a few weaknesses and problems but I don't think a single one of them is on your list.

However, for people who use it regularly, essentially nothing you have written is a problem. ",1543011377.0
123abc-123xyz,"You use Matlab because the C engine behind the matrix manipulation capabilities of the software are superior to anything else out there. You use Matlab because it remains an industry standard for many fields. You use Matlab because it has an intuitive scripting interface for rapid technical computing. You use Matlab because Simulink is extremely powerful for systems engineering.

Your points are relatively weak, but of course Matlab has many deficiencies, as does any other computing language. That being said, I think each of your points can be addressed and/or countered. 

1) In my experience this doesn't happen frequently for any of the core methods. Maybe it happens in some auxiliary toolboxes? But even there I haven't seen it much. And there are nevertheless ways to handle it. 2) Matlab isn't very good for graphical interfaces and plotting unless it's relatively simple. If you are trying to make a publishable-quality figure, I'd recommend alternatives. That being said Matlab gives you quite a bit of control and the basics don't take long to pick up. You can make a feature-full plot in just a couple lines. 3) Actually plot and ezplot are doing different things and as such have different syntax. Note that ezplot is intended for purposes when you have a function instead of vectors. That's why the function is the first input. ezplot isn't really used much outside of introductory tutorials anyway. 4) I disagree, exceptions and errors in Matlab are very descriptive. You mention Python here and in my experience the error and/or exception descriptions are very comparable across the two frameworks. 5) You only install Matlab once and in 2018 it's not too much to ask for 20 gigs, IMO. Not to mention you don't have to worry about manually installing any dependencies or libraries like Python. That being said you don't have to install the entire beast if you don't want to.

It seems to me that you're not using Matlab properly. Your sampling frequency (related to the Nyquist frequency) determines your simulation time step (reciprocals of each other), which influences your time variable. Seems like you're not defining your time variable properly (with linspace or whatever) and this is causing issues with your plots. In fact, there's a possibility than your filter's responses that you're plotting are altogether incorrect due to incorrect sampling frequency or the time variable.

You could use python too or any programming language, but MATLAB combines the high number of packages and graphical performance that really helps. I may have used only Monte Carlo Simulations, but that also holds true for optimization problems, solving differential equations and modelling many-body interactions. For pure programming (a.k.a. developing apps and such) it is useless, but MATLAB is very reliable for scientific programming and for teaching, too.

Matlab's a lot better these days than it used to be, and unless you're using some of the rarer toolboxes, quite stable - I've got bits that more or less originate from my B.Sc thesis and still run fine. Python has increased in efficiency a lot, but... oh dear, it's been 15 years ago, our actually working alternatives were the likes of C, or if you were a real computational mathematician, FORTRAN.

Matlab errors can be cryptic, if you don't note that it tells what called the function where the crash is. In many cases the crash is in a built-in function, whereas the actual cause may be in the calling script or 1 - 2 functions deep. The IDE helps a lot. (You haven't seen error messages until you start seeing Java errors - Matlab runs on top of a JVM.)

Back in the day, our tutorials didn't include ezplot (and these days, it appears to be about to be deprecated in favour of fplot), but they did include xlim, ylim and zlim commands for setting custom axis limits.

So, Matlab's nice for prototyping some code fast, once you're familiar with it. For some people looking for free alternatives, there's at least Octave and Scilab.

Here are my top use cases for Matlab:

Testing and distributing libraries ive written in C#, or C++/CLI that are compiled as .Net assembly (.dll). Matlab is often a common ground among engineers, so it's minimal effort for someone else to test or use functionality of something I've written in a C language if it's in the form of a .dll.

Quickly testing math related programs, especially those involving image or matrix manipulation (in matlab they are the same thing).

Quickly plotting a simple graph. Pasting data into a variable in your workspace and then plotting couldn't be easier.

Converting Matlab functions to C using Matlab Coder. There is no denying Matlab has a good amount of resources, allowing certain functions to be researched and optimized to the point of being superior to similar functions in other languages. Detect checkerboard points and spline are two that come to mind.

As far as some of the complaints you have.. Matlab is incredibly backwards compatible when it comes to base functions. More so than Python, at least (Python 3.4 and Python 2.7 have serious incompatibility issues). And plotting couldn't be easier.

FrickinLazerBeams,"Is that the output of your ODE solving code? Or the function representing the DE itself? That's definitely not the output prototype of the existing DE solvers in Matlab.

If that's the output format of the DE solver itself, you need to be assigning those outputs to variables when you call the function. They don't get assigned just because you defined them as outputs in the function definition. 

If that's the function defining the DE itself, rather than its solution, you could evaluate it after the solution is computed to get all of the derivatives etc. at the time steps specified by the solver. Returning the values at each invocation of the function during the solver iterations is probably not what you want, since most DE solvers adjust their vector of time points dynamically as they converge to a solution. If you really need this you could look at the documentation for `assignin()` but I wouldn't really recommend that. 

A variable being displayed to the console unexpectedly is usually because you missed a semicolon somewhere. The editor should hilight this for you. Unless you're simply seeing the output of your call to the DE solver in the console? This is still because of the lack of a semicolon, and again the other variables aren't being stored because you're not assigning them to anything. ",1542900426.0

The standard formula for relative error is something like:

    relativeError = (theoreticalValue - approximateValue)/theoreticalValue

Dividing by the theoretical value scales the absolute error (the numerator) by the value expected from analysis, making it *relative* to the ""actual"" value.

> I have used the integral function on each section, is this the value I should compare to to acquire relative error?

Take a look at the [documentation for integral](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/integral.html).  [Adaptive quadrature](https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2016/05/23/modernization-of-numerical-integration-from-quad-to-integral/) is not the same as [composite trapezoidal integration](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrapezoidalRule.html).  The [wiki article on it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule) tells you about [error analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule#Error_analysis).  MATLAB has built-in [cumulative trapezoidal rule integration](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/cumtrapz.html), and [complete trapezoidal rule integration](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/trapz.html), but given the first part of the assignment with the mandatory for loop and conditionals, you might need to implement it yourself...

> My code is showing exactly 50% CPU usage on a core i7, meaning it is using all the physical cores without hyperthreading.  Any attempt to make it do beyond 50% actually makes the execution time worse. 

So, etsting this has been on my to-do list (ill get to it eventually...), but I think that this is actually using 100% of the CPU (i.e., all 8 logicsl cores), at least for matrix operations that report 50% utalization.

The reason that (i think) this happens is because MKL is setup so that you tell it to use the number of physical cores in the system, and it then will detect if SMT/hyperthreading is enabled and will then assign either 1 or 2 threads per core depending on if it is or not. Im guessing that the system onlysees this as 1 thread in hyper thereaded cores, hense the 50%.

Of course it could also be a bug in matlab, or a bug in mkl, of just that hyper threading doesnt help, but none of those explain why forcing more threads actually hurts performance if you are really only using half the cpu. On the other hand, if you are already using all threads and force more you just end up thrashing, which will hurt performance.",1542599067.0

For a  quick explanation of the theory. In general, convolution via loops is an O(NM) operation (N size of kernel, M size of data), whereas the fft is an O(N\*log(N)) operation.

2. Try a different version of X11. If you're on the most current version, try the previous stable release. Maybe try the newest unstable beta code.
3. If that doesn't make the problem go away, try changing other stuff. X11 is incomprehensible arcane witchcraft with a config file.

If you want to keep the good index notation after the convolution, you should define a new array which account the transient state. A good way is like that:

conv(h,x);

n\_conv = n\_h(1)+n\_x(1):n\_h(end)+n\_x(end);

where n\_h and n\_x are the index array of h and x respectively. You can obtain n\_h from impz with \[h,n\_h\] = impz(...)

In your particular case, it will give the same graph as if no x-axis data were given, because both x and h start at 0. However, using the index array as define here is a good practice to graph the correct information whatever the starting index of the arrays are.

You also only want to deal with a single frame at a time when possible - uncomopressed video uses a lot of memory fast. Combined, these should make it quite a bit faster.

EXAMPLE: instead of

    vidObj = <...>
    figure
    for nn=1:N
        imagesc(data(:,:,:,nn))
        xlim([minX,maxX])

Do this instead:

    ff = figure;
    for nn=1:N
        if nn == 1    % generate the full figure on the 1st iteration
            imagesc(ff,data(:,:,:,nn))

BillyTheClub,"I think it has to do with the unsupported use of the c style printf specifier: ""%g""

To concatenate a number into to a string you do it with array syntax. In a basic example

    for i = 1:10
        disp( ['Current index is ',num2str(i),' out of 10'] );
    end 

For your case I would rewrite the input command as follows

    for i = 1:1:r_sat
        for j = 2:1:c_sat
            while saturated_data(i,j) < 0
                saturated_data(i,j) = input(['Please replace the value at temperature ',num2str(saturated_data(i,1)),': ']);
            end
        end
    end

The key difference is that you put the temperature into the string before you pass it to the input function. In your implementation it is trying to pass a string and a double as two different arguments.

cincymatt,"This is basically a trig/geometry problem.  I think you could probably sort out a way to do it other than brute force (taking points on each circle and checking distance, then searching points around the closest two, until you find a minimum. There are at least a few observations to get started:    
    
- the circles will not intersect if    
 1. The distance between the center points is greater than the sum of radii
 2. The distance between the points plus the radius of the smaller circle is less than the radius of the larger circle (one is inside the other, but not touching)
- if they intersect, the two points will lie on a line perpendicular to a line drawn between the two center points.
- there is only one intersect point if the distance between the circles is equal to the sum of their radii

I’m not going to work this out, but there is probably a relationship between the radii, the distance between circles, and the distance along the perpendicular line to find intersection points. If you can’t find that, then maybe an fmin search of distance between points where the angle around each center point are the variables.

So one thing is that if possible, updating may solve your issues. I believe with later versions of Matlab they have it so it will ignore NaN data.

The you need to iterate through the Newton-Raphson method a bunch of times. The exact number of iterations depends on a check with a tolerance value, which can be something like:

    if abs(E - E0) < tol:
        break

Otherwise, continue iterating with the current approximation E being taken as initial approximation E0 for the next iteration:

    E0 = E;

The iteration is done with a while loop, which always evaluates to true, unless the stopping condition is met.

    while 1:
        E = E0 + (M-E0+e*sin(E0))/(1-e*cos(E0));

1) you use stuff before it is defined. e.g.,

    covar=cov(weekly_return);
    sigma=sqrt(weight'*covar*weight);

Literally none of those variables had been previously defined when this appears in the code.

2) an extra `end` in

        std_return(i)=weighted_return(i)*(1/sigma_ewma(i));
        end    % <--- what is this ending???
    end

3) should `
var_95_hull=varhist(std_return1,0.95,vp);` be `
var_95_hull=varhist(std_return,0.95,vp);`?

4) do you really want to weight each point based on the average variance, or weight each point based on the variance and then use those to average the points?

How many $10's can you give them back? Well, 15.75/10 = 1.575, so the whole number up front is 1, that means you can give them back 1 $10 bill. Now you have $15.75 - $10 = $5.75 worth of change to give. Repeat the process until you have no change left.

If x were trapped in an object or cell array, it would make sense bringing it down into a temp variable--even if it changes size--if you're using it more than once in the loop.  However, if x is just sitting in the workspace using a well named mask would be my preferred approach.

Three things about this conditional statement:

1. Try to use anything other than `i` for your iteration variable.  I use `idx` in the general case, and if I'm iterating over something specific, I name it after that (e.g. if I'm iterating over a frequency range, I'd use `freq` as my iteration variable).  MATLAB is pretty smart behind the scenes, but there's no reason to try to confuse your iteration variable and the imaginary number!

3. In [the last question you asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/9u26h5/how_to_find_k_value_using_for_loop_statement_when/), I mentioned the `break` command.  See the documentation for that, as it's what you need here to ensure that you stop when your condition is true.  As of right now, even if your condition were true, your code wouldn't do anything, and instead would just continue on to the next iteration!

If you want to see the plot for `G` **and** the plot for `ki*G`, use the `figure` command prior to calling `rlocus`.  This creates a new figure window and makes it active, so that your next plotting command (in this case `rlocus`) uses that new window:

    figure
    rlocus(ki*G)

Don't do that in a loop, however, as you will quickly be overrun with figures!  Wait until after the loop, when you've got your value, and *then* use it.

Finally, since you're not actually using your iteration value, and you're actually looking for a condition to be met, you might want to use a [while loop](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/while.html) instead of a for loop.  Take a look and see what you think.",1541610466.0

avataRJ,"First, specs. What kind of information do you need to read from the SVG? Lines only? Any optimization, or just drawing the lines good enough?

SVG defines a line as (example code from [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_line.asp)):

    <line x1=""0"" y1=""0"" x2=""200"" y2=""200"" style=""stroke:rgb(255,0,0);stroke-width:2"" />

(W3schools does also have the specs on other SVG objects, which may be relevant - maybe polyline?)

So if it's all lines, the first task is to make a loop which seeks all relevant objects, and for each object type reads the coordinates and stores them into an array.

Then, depending on what kind of G code you're expected to produce, one way would be to just loop so that you output coordinates line by line by e.g. going to beginning of the line with a G0 (rapid movement) and ""draw"" lines by going to the endpoint with G1 (linear interpolation).

If you model a specific tool, you may need to use e.g. laser on / laser off commands to ""draw"".

You may also need to consider collision avoidance, so in that case, unless the next line starts immediately (e.g. with polyline, or lines drawn to the same coordinate points), you may need to move the ""tool"" away from the ""part"", then G0 to a point close to the next point, G1 approach the part, and the G1 draw. (If you have more than lines, then you need to appropriate e.g. circular interpolation G2 or G3 command.)

So, the simple way is to list tags you're interested of. Load file, read until a tag is found, read coordinates from that tag, add to list and mark if you need to draw or not. Let's say we're drawing a line from (0,0) to (5,0) and then a polyline (0,500), (100,400), (200,500), (300,400), (400,500), (500,400) and (600,500):

    <svg height=""700"" width=""800"">
      <line x1=""0"" y1=""100"" x2=""600"" y2=""100"" style=""stroke:black;stroke-width:1"" />
      <polyline points=""0,500 100,400 200,500 300,400 400,500 500,400 600,500"" style=""fill:none;stroke:black;stroke-width:1"" />
    </svg>

First your code notices line, and ID start and end points. Next tag is polyline, and then you'll have one start point and a number of continuous points it'll need to draw. I'd probably store that as (fill iteratively, also count number of points npoints):

    points = [0,100,0;
              600,100,1;
              0,500,0;
              100,400,1;
              200,500,1;
              300,400,1;
              400,500,1;
              500,400,1;
              600,500,1];

Note that ""starting points"" are marked with zero. Outputting from that to G code would be simple

    for i = 1:npoints
        fprintf(file,'G%.0f X%.0f YF.0f\n', points(i,3), points(i,1), points(i,2));

The *Out\[\]* means the output after compiling the previous line of code. Again, your screenshot isn't MATLAB. In MATLAB, you should create a script file (\*.m file), and then put all of your code in there and then press Run.

> Is that a space between :=? 

There is no space in between : and =. The ':=' means 'is defined as' aka the assignment operator. This piece of code means when you call the DH2HomTrans function with a bunch of parameters, the program will calculate Ti from them. Kinda like when you type *cos(60)* on your calculator, the *cos* function is defined as the cosine of the input parameter. Again, I'm gonna warn you that this isn't MATLAB code, and so on you'll get doubly confused for nothing. The assignment operator *is defined as* ':=' in MATLAB is

FrickinLazerBeams,">honestly, I have no idea what I've done in my code

This is the core problem here. You're just typing code at random that seems vaguely related to the problem you're trying to solve.

Don't do that. It will never work aside from random dumb luck, and even then you won't learn anything.

Read each line of your code and think about what it does. If you're not sure, read the documentation, and experiment in the console, until you are sure what it does.

Think about what you *want* to do, and then write code that does it. It's not a magic spell, it's a list of very specific steps that will be executed. Write the steps that you want to be done. If you don't know how to write those steps *figure out how*. You have to know what code to write before you write it, not the other way around. ",1541361423.0

This code does the following:

1. declare and initialize iteration variable to zero
2. declare and initialize iteration limit to four
3. begin a for loop, re-declaring iteration variable and initializing it to zero again
4. declare and initialize a scalar quantity 'squared' as two to the power of the iteration variable, performing the operation [element-wise](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/array-vs-matrix-operations.html) despite using two scalars
5. declare a new variable, and initialize it to the ""sum"" of a scalar quantity (aka just the quantity), then output to the command window
6. proceed to next iteration count, return to step 4, repeat until iteration variable reaches iteration limit minus one

If you can generate a sequence of indices, you can use them to index the vector.  The don't even have to be in ascending order.  For example to reverse a vector you can use:

    x = rand(30,1)

Here is a hint: suppose you want to extract elements of a vector `x` which meet a certain condition `cond1`. If you were doing a loop you would do it something like this, in pseudocode:

    for each element of x
        if x(i) satisfies cond1
            append x(i) to v
       end
    end

But its much easier to do it in Matlab. You just write

    v = x(cond1)
assuming `cond1` equals 1 in the `i`th element if `x(i)` satisfies `cond1` and 0 otherwise.
To do two conditions:

    v = x(cond1 & cond2)

You've already defined `cond1` (actually you've defined `~cond1` - you should look that up if you don't know that syntax).

TheBlackCat13,"Short version: If you are using a version after 2017a, use `A==""Yes""` instead (note the double quotes).  For earlier versions use `strcmp(A, 'Yes')` (this also works in later versions but is not as clean).  

Long version:

`A=='Yes'` does an element-by-element comparison of the sequence of characters in `A` and the sequence of characters in `'Yes'` and gives you a vector of `1` and `0` values for where they match and don't match.  You can think of it as doing `A==['Y', 'e', 's']`.  If `A` is no, you get `['N', 'o']==['Y', 'e', 's']`, which of course doesn't work because the sizes don't match.  By comparison `A` being `['Y', 'e', 'a']` would give you `[1, 1, 0]`, since the last character doesn't match.

`A==""Yes""` and `strcmp(A, 'Yes')`, on the other hand, check whether the whole sequence is the same.  `strcmp` directly compares the whole sequence of characters rather than doing it element-by-element, returning a `1` if the whole thing matches (different sizes of course do not match), and `0` if it doesn't.  So `strcmp('No', 'Yes')` would give a `0`. 

`A==""Yes""`, on the other hand, first converts `A` to a string, then does a whole-string comparison.  This is because using double quotes creates a string variable while using single quotes creates a character array.  For character arrays, `==` is element-by-element, while for strings it checks the equality of the whole string (giving a single `1` or `0` rather than a `1` or `0` for each element).  And operations involving both character arrays and strings automatically convert the character arrays to strings, so `A==""Yes""` is the same as `string(A)==""Yes""`.  But strings were only introduced in R2016b and double quotes only started being used to create strings in R2017a.  

Note that the documentation is inconsistent, the term ""string"" and ""character array"" were used interchangeably before R2016b, so many places still refer to ""strings"" when they really mean ""characters arrays"".",1541081018.0

If you dont need more that 16 gb of ram at once? little to none (youll be able to cache more data in memory for faster access, but thats about it)

If you do need more than 16gb at once? A HUGE difference.

More ram is tremendously useful iuf youre running out, and not much help if you already have enough.

Define large. a few GB? a few hundred GB? a few TB?

> Does having a high end video card make a difference in the speed of running analyses

If you have the parallel computing toolbox you can offload some tasks to the GPU. If the task is embarrasingly parallel and compute intensive enough to saturate the GPU and make up for the I/O to/from the GPU you might see some good improvement. If you dont actively use it it wont be all that much better than integrated just for, say, making figures and other graphical tasks.

OTHER THOUGHTS

* as someone who owned a ""power laptop"" for 5+ years, I can confidently say Id rather have gotten something ultra-portable and a desktop. cost/performance is better on a desktop, and you can even set things up to connect to it remotely to run things on the desktop via the laptop. Just something to consider.

* If you think you will be using matrix operations a lot, I would stick with intel over AMD. Rynex has a lot going for it, but one area it is really lagging in is AVX, which is heavily utalized in matrix operations (and a few other high-performance codes, e.g. `fft`).",1540959537.0

Video card doesn't matter much, unless you do machine learning or want to accelerate some functions with GPU. Then your best bet is high end nvidia GPU. I would say at least GTX 1080 if you want a reasonable acceleration for ML.

Anyway, you can still ""solve"" the equations in this case. If you are in the infinite solutions case, then you have a hyperplane of solutions whose dimension matches the rank of the degeneracy in your matrix (e.g. the multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue in the square case). But this is easy to solve since you can make arbitrary choices for these free components and solve uniquely for the rest. This produces a solution. Apparently MATLAB chooses zeros for the arbitrary coefficients. 

If you are in the no solutions case, then you can consider the collection of vectors, b - Ax, where x ranges over all vectors in your space. This vector is never zero, but its norm varies continuously so it has a minimum. This is a unique vector, x*, which satisfies |b - Ax*| is minimal. In other words, it finds the vector which comes closest to satisfying the equation. The method is based on the Moore-Penrose inverse (google it). ",1540531744.0

A few thoughts. Feel free to take em or leave em.

* get a 1tb 970 pro. Its faster (by a little), will help ensure you dont run out of space, and since quickly pricing out those specs on dells website is looking at $20k+ you can afford the few hundred more.

* if you do a lot of AVX-heavy operations (especially matrix-based operations) the xeons will blow away any epyc chip. Even without AVX512 they have a significant advantage using AVX2+FMA3. With AVX512 they just fly. I get ~3.2/1.6 TFLOPS (single./double precision) on my i9-7940x....But, if you dont use much AVX, epyc might be a decent option. Youll still have the NUMA issue to deal with (in my experience MATLAB is entirely NUMA blind, but that was running on an ancient linux kernel, so newer systems might do better)

* If you do a lot of matrix based stuff, link MATLAB to the most recent MKL version. I have some codes that do this automatically when you start matlab that id be happy to share if your like. With AVX512 enabled cpus you very well may see a noticable improvement, since many of the newest updates to MKL have to do with improving AVX512 support/efficiency

* idk what OS you plan on using, but Windows was unstable as hell on my machine. In your situation id probably go RHEL, but thats just me. My machine currently runs linux mint, and has been very stable. Performance is also much better in MATLAB than it was on windows (I see a factor of 2x improvement in more than a few codes)

* Id throw at least 3 more of the save HDDs in (i know you say no custom stuff, but adding hard drives really is easy and much cheaper to do yourself....just saying). I say 3 more since that gives 4 total, which allows raid 10 (mirroring + striping) to increase data protection and access speed. Id also go for at least 7200 rpm drives, more if you can. My machine uses `zfs` to manage my 10 x 8 TB raid6 array, and it has works quite well so far. It also (to my surprise) seems to utilize AVX512 , at least in its raid 6 (what it calls raidz2) mode.

* If you can id consider throwing in a m.2 optane drive or 2. My machine has 2 32gb ones - one for a permanent swap decive and one for the ZFS ZIL SLOG (kind of like a write cache for the array)

* The gv100 should be fantastic for deep learning, due to its tensor cores (basically, these make mixed fp16/32 matrix operations hardware accelerated, and these operations are pretty common in many machine learning methods)

* if its going to be accessed a lot remotely and transfer a lot of data (the MySQL part makes me think this is likely) get the x550-t2 dual 10g NIC upgrade. It would be silly to have all that power and be limited by network I/O",1540570373.0

You're pretty close until the last bit.

You need to work on two things here. First, you have to understand the math before you can work on writing code. A program is just a list of instructions, and you'll never be able to write instructions for doing something that you don't know how to do.

Second, you need to learn how *indexing* works.

On the first topic, do you understand how the perimeter of the polygon is being calculated? The perimeter of a polygon is a collection of line segments, right? Do you know how the length of a line segment is calculated? In a polygon with N vertices, how many line segments are there? Which polygon vertices are the endpoints for each of these segments? Try writing a list of these out by hand for some simple examples like a triangle or quadrilateral.

On the second topic, indexing is how you talk about a particular element in a list of elements. If x is an array (a vector) of numbers, x(3) is the third element in the list. You should read about this in the documentation. Then think about whether it makes sense to ever write x-(x+1). Combine that with your new understanding of how to calculate polygon perimeters from above and think about what you should actually write instead.

Also take a closer look at the formula given in your assessment. How does it fit with your understanding of the perimeter of a polygon? Does it resemble an equation you're already familiar with, like the Pythagorean theorem? ",1540471390.0
DemoniWaari,"Maybe using a helper variables in the for loop would clarify things a little. For example you could have 

    Dx=x(i)-x(i-1); Dy=y(i)-y(i+1);

    seg_length=pythagoras(Dx,Dy);

Then you just loop it like you did before and sum the lengths together as needed.",1540471250.0

Gray levels/grayscale just means that at each pixel location, an image has a 1-dimensional bit depth.

For an RGB image, you have three 8-bit numbers representing each of the color channels (Red, Green, and Blue). Each can be from 0-255. To calculate a mean gray level, you would need to first convert it to grayscale (Grayscale(i,j) = (R(i,j) + G(i,j) + B(i,j))/3).

This automatically exits the while loop if it runs for an unreasonable number of iterations and throws a warning to let you know. 

If it *should* be getting the condition theres probably something wrong with the code. If I had to guess, `Qh` is going to effectively 0 (or perhaps a negative number) in the inner loop before its condition is met, so it doesnt alter `E_Q` and the outerloop effectively re-runs the exact same thing over and over again (or, if `Qh` is negative, it would increase `E_Q` making it never reach its condition).

larsie001,"A bit info would allow me/us to help you a bit better!

I'm guessing that you have a vector for each of the two solutions, and a vector for all the time values at each entry! That means 3 nice vectors of the same dimension; let's say for 500 time points; meaning you have 3 vectors of 500 long (A, B and T).

Finding the point where they first equal can be done in multiple ways. I would go with the following: 

1. Test the entire 2 vectors for equality:    
testForEquality = eq(A,B)    
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eq.html    
The resulting array should give zeros and ones based on the equality.    
Example:    
>    A = [5 4 3 2 1]    
>    B = [1 3 3 5 1]    
>    testForEquality = eq(A,B)    
>    Now testForEquality would equal: [0 0 1 0 1]    

2. Now, extract from T all the times where the values are equal;
T_equal  = T[testForEquality]

3. Extract now from T_equal  the earliest time:
T_earliest = min(T_equal)

A possible and very probable bug in this might be that the values of your solved ODE system are never precisely zero! This will happen almost guaranteed, as computers work with fixed precision. The way around this would to check not for equality, but for maximum distance below a tolerance which is a few orders of magnitude bigger than the precision of your computation. For MATLAB with float I would guess to test somewhere around 10^-10 first.

The updated algorithm would then be:

1. absDifference = abs(A - B)

2. testForEquality = (10.^10 > absDifference )

3. T_equal  = T[testForEquality]

4. T_earliest = min(T_equal)

Note that the vectors are unlikely to actually have the exact same value, which is why we test for a sign change, rather than testing for zero.

First, rewrite your system so you'll get something in term of cos^(2)( θ ) and sin^(2)( θ ).

 cos^(2)( θ ) = 4(a-x^(2)\-y)^(2)

sin^(2)( θ )=(4/9)(2-x^(2)\+y)^(2) 

then, adding the two equation will give you

 cos^(2)( θ ) + sin^(2)( θ ) =  4(a-x^(2)\-y)^(2)\+ (4/9)(2-x^(2)\+y)^(2) =1

In matlab you create a function like this

    function res = g(x, y, a)
    res = 4 * (a - x^2 - y)^2 + (4 / 9) * (2 - x^2 + y)^2 - 1;

fft zero pads the end of the signal. If you want different behavior you should manually zero pad it

`lFFT = fft(Lo_D, imgFFT);` should probably be `lFFT = fft(Lo_D, size(imgFFT,1));`.  Same for `hFFT`

note that fft returns frequencies in the following order: `[0:df:nyquist-df,-nyquist:df:-df]`. You can make it return `[-nyquist:df:nyquist-df]` using `fftshift(fft(...))` and `ifft(ifftshift(...))`",1539911797.0

diogenes_cat,"As stated in another comment, the loop initialization should be changed to i = 1:length(t).

This won't change the result though, since after the loop finishes, x\_f is a scalar (your plot isn't empty, it contains exactly one point). You want x\_f to be a vector, so in each iteration of the loop you should assign the result to an element of this vector:

`x_f(i) = (1/w*(w^2-wo^2))*((w*sin(wo*i))-(wo*sin(w*i)));`

Since you know the size of x\_f, it's good practice to pre-allocate it (before the loop):

`x_f = zeros(size(t));`

&#x200B;

By the way, you can achieve the same result without a loop (which usually means better performance):

`t = 0:500;`

TheQueq,"The first key to efficiency in matlab is vectorising for loops.  In some ways, this makes your code particularly well suited.  The key is logical indexing, which will allow you to operate on all the elements in a matrix that satisfy a certain condition.  However, the approach that you use may include some entries which have been modified and some entries that have not been modified, which makes it difficult to reproduce the exact behaviour efficiently.

As other posters have pointed out, your approach to correcting errors may not be doing what you think/want.  For one, it assumes that the mean of the surrounding values will evaluate to an acceptable value.  Without knowing the nature of your data/problem, the most apparent solution to me appears to be replacing all values below a given threshold with that threshold value.  This is as simple as the following line:

    A(A<threshold) = threshold;

If you are confident that your original approach of replacing with the average of the surrounding values is appropriate, and also that the boundaries don't need correcting, then you can get similar behaviour with the below:

    ROI11=A(1:end-2,1:end-2);
    ROI12=A(1:end-2,2:end-1);
    ROI13=A(1:end-2,3:end);
    ROI21=A(2:end-1,1:end-2);
    ROI22=A(2:end-1,2:end-1);
    ROI23=A(2:end-1,3:end);
    ROI31=A(3:end  ,1:end-2);
    ROI32=A(3:end  ,2:end-1);
    ROI33=A(3:end  ,3:end);
    mnROI = (ROI11+ROI12+ROI13+ROI21+ROI22+ROI23+ROI31+ROI32+ROI33)/9;
    B=A(2:end-1,2:end-1);
    B(B<threshold)=mnROI(B<threshold);
    A(2:end-1,2:end-1) = B;

The above code has the difference that it will operate on the entire matrix, so if A(3,4) is corrected, then A(4,4) will not use the corrected value in its own correction.  The above code could probably be made cleaner - and possible faster - with higher order matrices, but this approach should work, and I expect it to be faster.",1539792417.0

roberto_m,"First of all I'm going to tell you, I realised you might feel frustrated, but don't despair. Most academic papers aren't exactly forthcoming in their implementation details, unfortunately, and also many of them have the habit of coming up with their own non-standard notation, as it seems to be the case here.

As for the problem you're asking about, I don't have access to the paper and it's a bit hard to understand how to implement it just from the equation you pasted, as the notation is a bit muddy. That inverse Nabla operator makes me think of a reintegration operation (being the inverse of a gradient an integral). It's also not clear what the index _i_ is. If it's the _x_ and _y_ dimensions, then it's possible that you can implement the inverse nabla using the `cumsum` function in the appropriate direction. Using your code above:

    cumsum(res_x ./ sqrt(res_x .* res_x + e), 2)
    cumsum(res_y ./ sqrt(res_y .* res_y + e), 1)

(Note the dimension of the sum: I used 2 in the first line because the _x_ direction on Matlab images is actually the second dimension. Also, note the use of the `./` element-wise division, the `/` you're using in your code is incorrect.)

apefred_de,"Import xls: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/xlsread.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/xlsread.html)

basically something like this

    data = xlsread('filename.xls','A6:F22');  %imports all values from A6 to F22 into a matrix

But keep in mind that your decimal symbol is comma and not a dot, I don't exactly know if matlab works with this notation!

&#x200B;

Then you can utilize the `find` function to find your value in your temperature column

[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/find.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/find.html)

    [row, ~] = find(temp<=data(:,2));  %temp is the temperature you are searching for

This gives you the row of a temperature that is equal or larger than the one you searching for but probably this isn't the smallest delta! So maybe check the row before this element. 

Quickly hacked together, not nice and room for improvement but I think easy to understand:

    delta1 = abs(data(row,2)-temp);
    delta2 = abs(data(row-1,2)-temp);
    
    if delta1 <= delta2
      row_nearest = row;
    else
      row_nearest = row-1;
    end

What you can do to interpolate:

* Simple linear interpolation
* What you can also do is a curve fitting like `polyfit`  ([https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/polyfit.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/polyfit.html)) to get basically functions density(Temperature) and so on",1539531723.0

Second, this might be setup such that each worker is getting sent a copy of the ENTIRE data. What does memory usage look like using `parfor` vs `for`? If `parfor`'s usage is considerably higher this is happening. Im not sure the best way to fix it, since I try to avoid using `parfor` whenever possible (vectorized operations are multi-threaded and considerably more efficient). Maybe try putting them in a [1 x 4] cell array instead of combining them along the 3rd dimension???",1539469939.0

If you really need to parallelize this calculation, do it inside `lagrange_remap`. You want to make sure you leave the threads up and running for use in subsequent calls though, the overhead of creating the threads each time would be bad, much like what you're seeing with `parfor`.",1539515608.0
cincymatt,"Edit:  I reread your question and see that you specified the Mex function as single-thread, so my comment below is dumb.  To answer your question, that is technically how parfor is used, but it is normally used when the loop has a bazillion iterations of a simple calculation, rather than a few heavy loops.

To preface, I don’t have experience with this application.  However, I do have *some* experience with parfor.  Usually, it is useful when you have many iterations of a for loop, and each is executed in short form.  In your description, you only have 4 cases (although the graph suggests that it varies?).  It seems the brunt of the overhead is within the mex function, and it is uncertain how it is carrying out its calculations.  It is possible that the code within the mex function is already multithreaded, and by asking Matlab to multithread you are multiplying the number of threads competing for the available cores.  Obviously there is some resource (#cores, ram, Matlab heap memory, etc) that benefits from sequential evaluation.    
    
 I would check to see if the Profiler has any recommendations.  I’ve shaved orders of magnitude off of evaluation of mex functions just by being more precise with data-types (as the Profiler suggested). Is this something that will used long-term? If so, then it might be worthwhile to dig into the mex function.  If you have an Nvidia gpu, you might be able to utilize [CUDA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) for gpu parallel-processing. Also, Matlab can use remote kernels, if you are at a university with a computing core.    
    
Then again, if this is for research or other short-term projects, it may be better to run them overnight and move on with your life :)

cincymatt,"It really is a beautiful method.  Those guys thought of some great stuff since they didn’t have a modern cluttered mind.    
    
 Since others are either assisting with the Matlab syntax or calling you out for trying to crowdsource your homework, maybe I can help with the overall concept.  You have a function and want to find the x such that f(x) =0, or the point where the function crosses the x-axis.  In Euler’s day, you couldn’t ask a computer to run 1k points and then take the closest to zero, so you had to be smart about your guesses.  So Euler and this other dude come up with a method for guessing an x-value based on the function value and the slope at some other point.  The first iteration needs a starting point, so you supply an uninformed guess ( x_0 ).  Plug x_0 into the equation to get the function value, and take the derivative at that point to get the slope ( the derivative is denoted as f’(x) and is often called the ‘slope’, ‘tangent’, ‘rate of change’, or ‘delta’ ).    
    
  So what good are these values?  Well now we know 1) how far from zero we are, 2) how fast the function is moving toward/away from zero, and 3) if it is moving toward zero or away from it ( by the sign of f/f’ - if both are positive or negative, the result will be positive ( +/+ = -/- = +), and therefore moving away from zero ).    
    
Consider the following two cases of a Furbee walking along a mountain and trying to get to sea level.  He uses his current location ( x_0 ) as the starting point and uses his altitude f(x_0) and the slope of the hill f’(x_0) to estimate how far and in what direction he will have to walk to get there.    

- f(x_0) = 100 m  | f’(x_0) = -1 m/km  | f(x_0)/f’(x_0) = -100 km    
- f(x_0) = 100 m  | f’(x_0) = + 1000 m/km  | f(x_0)/f’(x_0) = + 0.1 km    

    
So they both start off the same altitude, but the slope of the hill is different.  So now to make our next guess ( x_1 ) as to where the hills will reach sea level.    
    
- In the first case, the slope is negative, so he is going the right direction, but x_1 = x_0 - f(x_0)/f’(x_0) = x_0 - ( -100 km ) = x_0 + 100 km. Compared the the altitude, it is a fairly large distance.    
- In the second case x_1 = x_0 - f(x_0)/f’(x_0) = x_0 - ( + 0.1 km ) = x_0 - 0.1 km.   So he is close to the shore, but needs to turn around and to the other way. 
    

So we have very different follow-up guesses with changing only the slope.  Since the hill probably isn’t linear, when the Furbee in case 1 walks the 100 km to point x_1, it is likely that he still isn’t at 0 elevation. He can then measure his altitude f(x_1) and slope f’(x_1) to make his next guess of where the hill will intercept 0 altitude ( x_2 = x_1 - f(x_1)/f’(x_1) ).    
    
  Hopefully, he is closer to sea level and the next guess will bring him even closer.  This method will *normally* result in smaller distances for each iteration, but will likely never reach exactly zero.  This is why you specify upfront an acceptable range of values ( e.g. 0 +/- .01 ), and in case that range is never reached, a max number of iterations.

jkool702,"Ive come across a few legitimate uses for `eval`. Not many, but they do exist.

One example is [this](https://pastebin.com/BDZhPJuN) function. The point of that function is to automatically copy all your variables into a new workspace when you are debugging. They can either be discarded or saved back into the main function workspace, making it act as a way to test out a solution. The new workspace also is open, so if you have e.g., nested functions and cant make new variables in debug mode, this solves that (i use it *all the time* for this purpose).  At any rate since the variable names have to be dynamic, you sort of have to use `eval` to deal with them, but care is taken to isolate and only evaluate the correct variables (which was surprisingly tricky).

As far as securing it, I'd thin overloading `eval` with the following function would mitigate most concerns

    function eval(evalStr)
    %% Overloads eval and checks for (and rejects) system commands before executing it.

        evalStr=char(evalStr);

        if ~isempty(regexpi,evalStr,'system\(|unix\(|dos\(|\!')
            warning('The requested eval command has been determined to contain a system call, which is not supported. The command will not be run.')
        else
            evalin('caller',['builtin(''eval'',''',evalStr,''');']);
        end

    end

EDIT: this function has a couple typos. See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/9n7gbo/one_matlab_command_you_should_never_use_why_the/e7lw0nb/) comment for the fixed version.

This should reject any `eval` command that contains a system call, and run any other `eval` command using the builtin `eval` command in the callers workspace, which should be the same as if you didnt overload `eval` at all.",1539259357.0

    >> y2 = eps(y1);


we would expect that the largest number that would start giving errors would be on the order of sqrt(y1+y2), which of course cannot be computed using floating-point arithmetic.

Then, if it were me, id try and figure out a easy but not trivial beginner project that is actually related to what you do, and try and code it up. Maybe a particular data analysis method.

A few tips:  

if you arent sure what something does, run `help <command>` or `doc <command>` to bring up the help documentation

Pay attention to the syntax warning and error text that matlab shows you. This seems obvious, but a surprising number of people ignore this info coimpletely and then wonder why they cant figure out some error they are having.

Try and use matrix operations where possible. MATLAB is built for matrix operations, and they are both powerful and fast. 

example:

     % sample data
    x = randn(10,10);  % [10x10] matrix of normal random numbers
    
    % ""loop method"" = slow to execute and more work to write
    xSum=0;
    for n1=1:size(x,1)    % loop over 1st dim
        for n2=1:size(x,2)    % loop over 2nd dim
            xSum=xSum+x(n1,n2);    % add current value to sum
        end
    end

    % ""matrix method"" = fast
    xSum = ones(1,size(x,1)) * x * ones(size(x,2),1);",1539001512.0

J-man474,"There's a couple issues with your code, although the idea is right.

&#x200B;

Firstly, in order to access the 2x2 submatrix of `A` you have a few options, such as:

`A=rand(4)`

`A(3:4,3:4);`

`A([3 4],[3 4]);`

Your version of `(3,4:3,4)` is three independent values of `3`, a vector `[4 3]`, and `4` all separated by a comma. You may want to refer to the documentation regarding array indexing if this is confusing.

&#x200B;

Secondly, when you call `sum` you're not calling `A` so all you're doing is summing the three inputs I laid out above. As a result, calling `B=sum(3,4:3,4)` will always return `14`.

&#x200B;

Putting these together, your code should look more like this:

&#x200B;

`A=rand(4)`

`B=sum(A(3:4,3:4);`

`A` is a 2D matrix. If you wanted the 2nd row and 3rd column of `A` you could say `A(2,3)`. If you wanted rows 2 through 4 of column 3 you could write `A(2:4,3)`. To understand what the `2:4` is doing, you can type `x = 2:4` into the command window, and you'll see that x is `[2,3,4]`. In MATLAB, to build a vector you use the command `starting_value:step_value:final_value`. However, if you only put in two numbers, then MATLAB assumes `step_value = 1`. So really `2:4` is the same as `2:1:4`.

AlphaSquid_,"Brute force seems excessive, linear algebra is more reasonable. 


As stated by youself, you can formulate this problem as a simple linear equation Ax = b, and solve for x. Linear algebra tells you that the solution of this problem is a vector x0, plus a combination any vectors located in the null space of A.

The solution x0 can be found super easily using the [sudo inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%E2%80%93Penrose_inverse) of A, and the nullspace using the command *null(A)*. Then chose a combination of vectors in the nullspace to obtain an integer solution
Example:
 
     A = [1     1     1     1     0     0     0     0     0
          0     0     0     0     1     1     1     1     0
          0     0     0     1     0     1     0     1     1
          1     1     1     0     0     0     0     0     1
          1     1     0     1     1     0     0     0     0
          0     1     1     0     0     1     0     0     1
          0     0     1     0     0     0     1     1     1
          1     0     0     1     0     1     0     1     0
          1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1];
     b = [10    28    22    15    18    16    22    19    45].';
     N = null((A));

The nullspace has only dimension 1, the solution is easily found

     sol = pinv(A)*b + 0.5*N(:,1) % +0.5*N : make it integer
         = [ 4, 3, 1, 2, 9, 5, 6, 8, 7]

1)  Get the grayscale intensities from each pixel (if RGB then average them, but for uCT images it shouldnt be RGB)

2) plot a histogram of all the grayscale values from all the pixels in the image

3) manually choose cutoffs that roughly seperate the different peaks in the image. The peaks represent different mineral grains

4) everything below the lowest grayscale intensity peak's cutoff is porespace (in pores there is nothing that will coherently reflect the xrays in the CT scan, so there isnt much recorded by the detector and hense it is dark).

This is highly dependent on the cutoffs, but for more exact methods you should look into the digital rock physics literature.

FrickinLazerBeams,"That's not how switch/case works. You're comparing booleans, not the value of the discriminant. ",1538333607.0
J-man474,"When you open up a switch/case block with `switch discriminant` All cases are comparing the case value to the value in the switch statement, and checking to see if they match. In this example your discriminant is 0. So this is how the code would run:

* In the first case, it evaluates `discriminant == 0` which returns `true`, which is interpreted as `1`. 
* It then compares that case value of `1` to the switch statement `0` and it sees `0 == 1` which is false, and it moves to the next case. 
* The next case is `discriminant > 0` which returns `false`, and is interpreted as `0`. 
* It is then compares that case value of `0` to the switch statement `0` and it sees `0 == 0` which is true, and it runs that block. 

This means that if your discriminant was greater than 1, neither code block would run as it would not equal either 0 or 1.

&#x200B;

So how would you fix this? In the first case, simply call `case 0` to check if the discriminant is 0. however, your second case is a comparator, which doesn't work with switch/case blocks, as you can only call for a direct comparison with the discriminant. For this reason I recommend you only use if/elseif blocks to achieve your goal here. 

&#x200B;

However, in the event that you are required to use a switch/case block to complete your homework, consider how you could evaluate the discriminant to a boolean value *before* you enter the switch case, and go from there. Let me know if you need more help with that. ",1538334777.0

MATLAB has built-in formatting in the editor that is typically used alongside the [publish](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/publishing-matlab-code.html) feature, but it also serves to demarcate sections of code.  To use it, you prepend `%%` to a line, and then enter a title for the section or don't; either way it starts a new section of code.  Each section is set off from the others by background color (visible in the link above).  In your use case, this would help you keep your functions organized within a single script.  If you start this way and find that the script is still too long or unwieldy for your liking, you can extract the functions to their own files as needed.  If you find that you need more encapsulation, you can then collect functions and data structures into classes.  Another consideration might be that you notice some of your functions may be useful in future work; these are great candidates for extraction to separate files.

Some example descriptions:

* I have a transformer designer for my research that is currently at 23 files, with the main file being around 1300 lines.  It's a monster, but a significant portion of the main file is documentation for the other students in my lab, whose expertise lies elsewhere.
* I also have a GUI power quality analysis tool that is a single function file of about 500 lines, with nested functions, which was submitted as a course assignment.
* Over the summer I worked on a program at a large company that had something like 50 separate MATLAB function files, 5-10 MATLAB classes in their own files, and which was COM-managed by a sprawling VB.NET program of dozens of .vb and .resx files.

jkool702,"Depending on the specifics of the algorithm, nested functions might be the most efficient way to implement this (in terms of compute time, not necessairly in terms of code organization), for one simple reason: they allow in-place replacement.

example:

say you want something that does `x = x + y`

any function of the form 

    function x = myAddFun(x,y)
        x = x+y;

and then calling 

    x = <...>
    y = <...>

will create a temp copy of the input x, leaving you with 2 copies of x in memory. This is particularly annoying if `x` is very large.

Using nested functions though, you can do

    x = <...>
    y = <...>
    myAddFun

    function myAddFun
        x = x+y;
    end

and not need a 2nd copy of x, since `myAddFun` is applied directly to the variables from the calling function (instead of using pointers to the variables in the calling function which trigger the copy-on-write mechanism when you try to alter them)",1538192944.0

I would suggest you at least try alternatives and see what you can come up with. Even you bin them, that's still a useful result. 

> My main repo is already incorporated in git but i'd like it if my smaller independent projects could be tracked in git as well, keeping compatibility with my main repo.

I think this is a problem better tackled by a good directory structure, rather than git submodules. The structure I use to solve this problem is roughly

    apps\
        app1\
            src\
            lib\
            tests\
    lib\

Applications (apps\app1) are larger projects, which warrant their own libraries, files, and test cases. lib will contain general purpose libraries - Tools which can be used anywhere, for anything.

Figuring this out would help me use git submodule, but I don't want to perpetuate an X/Y problem so I'm open to all suggestions for MATLAB workflow. 

/u/designtofly has a good recommendation with packages. You can also make classes with static methods and get a very similar effect, where you can call functions using [class].[method]. I like this method so that I can have better visibility over closely related functions.

Also, you generally add folders to your path, not files. So even if you have a million functions in /lib/m/, you don't need to add them individually.

> I want protection from breaking the codes used years ago as it's important to track the process and just not the results of scientific analysis.

That's true, but git and code comments are not the best tools for this.

Git is a useful tool for corroborating changes and version control, but it doesn't guarantee good understanding of a code's history. 

Code has to function and be reviewed, but it can't be so thoroughly commented about how it has changed to the point that it impossible to review. Code is also a part of a much larger whole. Without understanding how it interacts, local-only documentation is useless.

External documentation, with full prose, and few limitations is the best way to track significant changes over time. External documentation is also great for understanding architecture, which will drive the necessary interfaces for functions. ",1538180734.0

If you're sure you are forbidden from using if/else, there is already good advice in the thread.  If not, I say [go for it](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/if.html).",1538077568.0

Using the function you create in problem 3 will directly allow you to solve problem 4; it will also allow you to re-run your simulation with different parameters easily.  Think about [looping](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/loop-control-statements.html) over the function call, and [plotting](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot.html) each output with different parameters on the same plot using the `hold on` command.  That's just one potential use, there are others that you will discover if you continue using MATLAB and Simulink.

B0oN3r,"now you put vector t as a subscript in x, matlab doesn't like that. A subscript should be a real, positive integer (this is you error, I guess?)

You can either write a loop:

    x = t
    for n = 1 : length (t)
        x (n) = sin (t(n));
    end

using n as you indicator. So at n = 1 t = 0, at n = 2 t = 0.05 etc

more elegantly you can just use matrix operation:

    x = sin (t);

where matlab will just do the sine elementwise. This is usually faster for matlab has hard-coded loops which are usually faster than home written loops.

for info type either

    help sin

or

    open sin

TCoop,"There's quite a simple fix - Have your optimizer solve for fits of all curves, not just one at a time. 

> I've used fmincon and fminsearch previously, but I haven't found a good way to iterate through fits for all of the different curves, only single curves at a time.

Since you're fitting a curve using a scalar value, I assume that the function you are using is returning the sum of absolute error, or sum of squared errors? Well, if you want to fit multiple curves, just include the errors from fitting the other functions, too! I've had experience using this method where I need to solve parametric problems where multiple thermodynamic conservation laws need to be maintained. 

Here's a quick example.

    % Load input vectors for curves and goal shape for curves
    load inputVec1 inputVec2 goalVec1 goalVec2
    KnownParam = [1, 2, 3];
    
    % How you probably are doing it now
    % Setup function handles for individual problems, which return a scalar value that represents the badness of fit
    funcFitQual1 = @(unknownParam) calcNormErr( goalVec1, calcCurve( inputVec1, knownParam, unknownParam))
    funcFitQual2 = @(unknownParam) calcNormErr( goalVec2, calcCurve( inputVec2, knownParam, unknownParam))
    % solve problems individually
    fitSol1 = fminsearch(@(x) funcFitQual1 (x))
    fitSol2 = fminsearch(@(x) funcFitQual2 (x))

    % How you can also do it
    % try to solve both problems by adding up their badness of fit
    fitSolBoth= fminsearch(@(x) sum(funcFitQual1(x), funcFitQual2(x)))

    %% Inline functions
    function Output = calcCurve(inputVec, knownParam, unknownParam)
        % Some Function which you are trying to fit to data
    end

    function errSumAbsNorm = calcNormErr(goalVec, curveVec)
        err = goalVec - curveVec;
        errNorm = err ./ goalVec;
        errSumAbsNorm = sum(abs(errNorm));
    end

The solver will find what creates the best fit for both problems. You can string together multiple problems this way, but you do need to have some concern for the errors you are working with in each problem. If the error generated by one fit is several times larger than the other, the optimizer will solve that problem better than the other one. ",1538015602.0

This approach works well as a first step towards getting started on nearly any problem.

You can think of any number of ways of solving this.  But if you were writing it down on paper, I would probably do something like this:  Find the smallest number in the original list, write it down in a new list, then cross it out from the first list.  Now find the smallest number in the updated original list, add it to the new list, cross it out, and just repeat this until you've gone through every item in the list.  This is best done using a for loop, which would loop through every index of the original array.  It would then find the minimum value of the array, and add that value to a new array, while deleting it from the first.  (A copy of the first array can be saved of course, so you can show both at the end).

Another approach might be to loop through each index of the array, and determine if an element is greater than the element after it.  If it is, simply swap those elements.  Continue looping through the entire array until you do a loop where you don't do any swaps, and have that be your exit criteria.  This is best done with a while loop, and a counter for the number of swaps.

Neither of these approaches are terribly efficient.  But for right now, you're not looking to write efficient code.  For right now, you should be learning how to take ideas in your head, and get them into code.  As you go through this process, always be thinking, ""How can I make this faster?"", and you'll continue to improve.  The important thing is though, that you make an honest effort to figure out how to actually write the code yourself.  This is an extremely easy assignment compared to things you'll use MATLAB for in the future, but it will teach you a lot if you work through it, and will make your life much easier moving forward if you have a strong foundation!",1537799342.0
beauterson,"[Here](https://brilliant.org/wiki/sorting-algorithms/) is a nice overview of different sorting algorithms, you could set up a fairly rudimentary one by implementing a for and while loop. But there's a thousand ways to do something like this, the assignment is getting you to understand the syntax of Matlab. 

I'd start by looking at *for* and *while* loops. 

Also googling '*sorting methods matlab*' gave me [this.](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45125-sorting-methods?focused=3805900&tab=function) In which you can look at the code to understand how they work.

What you'll learn with Matlab (and any coding) is initially a lot of it is knowing what and how to search for what you need.

Start out by thinking of the algorithm/process you want to use before you worry about the Matlab language itself.

I suggest switching the default help browser view from the shitty little window to the full size browser, but some people prefer the online documentation.

Try to start with easy problems, or maybe try to demonstrate something you already know the answer to. For example (I'm assuming this sort of statistics is relevant in econometrics?) simulate a random walk and demonstrate that it is a Martingale by finding the average value of x(n+1) given x(n); or something similar. Another easy statistical exercise is to show that events with exponentially distributed intervals demonstrate Poisson statistics.

Since you're starting, focus on building good habits and skills rather than taking the quickest route to the answer. This will matter when you're doing more complicated tasks.

Plan your data structures logically, and do it before you plan your code. (this will be somewhat futile at first, until you're more familiar with Matlab data structures, but start thinking about it now and trying your best, and it will happen naturally as you learn).

Think about when some task should be contained in its own function. Is it going to be used many times? Is it an operation that is useful outside your particular task? It should probably be a function.

wg90506,"As a general rule, to make your code more concise and also run faster, get in the habit of *not* using for loops in Matlab. Matlab stands for 'matrix laboratory' because it's good at working with matrices, and fairly poor at for loops.

So, with that in mind, the best way to do this is to just use the indices. The logical statement

> J == 77

returns a matrix with values of 1 where your matrix (J) is equal to 77. Furthermore, to find the indices, you can use the 'find' function. 

> find(J==77)

The find function returns the indices where the input is logically true (1).

Finally, you want to extract the actual values and put them into two separate matrices. Remember that J(indices) will give you the value of J at whichever index you input. 

So, a concise function would be:

> K = zeros(size(J)); %Create the base matrix for values of J == 77;

> L = zeros(size(J)); %Create base matrix for values of J != 77;

> inds = find(J == 77); %Determine indices where the matrix is equal to a desired number (77)

> K(inds) = J(inds); %At the indices where J == 77, set K = J

> L(~inds) = J(~inds); %At the indices where J != 77, set L = J


As a note, my assumption was that you want K and L to have the same size as J. I'm a bit confused by your code, as you are deleting certain rows/columns if they aren't equal to 77, but you can fix that easily.",1537546544.0
Koedlt,"The any function can come in handy in this case. Also, it is usually a good idea to avoid hardcoding anything in your code. So instead of hardcoding the number 77 you could define a variable like the following:

> nr = 77;
>
> J=[1 2 3 77 5; 77 1 2 77 3 ;1 2 3 4 5 ;1 2 3 4 5 ;1 77 3 4 5 ;1 2 3 4 5];
>
>
>
> nrInRow = any(J==nr,2);
>
> K = J(nrInRow==1,:);
>
> L = J(nrInRow==0,:);

So in 3 lines of code you have done it! Now, if you want to use your code for a different number than 77, you simply change the variable value. Since this is a short piece of program, changing the hardcoded value wouldn't be too bad. But imagine that you had written that number 77 in different parts of a very long code! You would have to look through whole the code, whereas when you define a variable you only change it in 1 place :)",1537549567.0

1. automate splitting the data into different blocks. Shouldnt be too hard since they seem pretty well seperated.

2. Starting with 2 possible levels, brute force every combination of assigning levels to each block. i.e., all blocks assigned to level 1 get curve fit together, and all blocks assigned to level 2 get curve fit together. Repeat for 3 levels, 4 levels, etc (I wouldnt go too high)

3. Compute a ""fitness attribute"" of some sort for each case. Penalize cases based on how many levels you use (since more levels will always fit the data better, but e.g. if 3 levels is sufficient and 4 doesnt help much penalizing 4 more than 3 will cause 3 levels to have higher overall fitness than 4 levels)

That's exactly what is meant by ""index exceeds matrix dimensions"".

The real issue is that your instructions have somehow resulted in you asking for a nonsensical thing - and **that's** a lot more important than the error itself.

Sure, I could get rid of the problem by repeating the list three times - now you'd have a 15th element to give me when I ask for it - but has that really solved the problem? Probably not. If I was asking for item 15 I probably needed something found on a different list.

Example one say you have a 4x4 matrix called “mat”, and somewhere in code you are trying to call “mat(5,4)”. This is the first example that MATLAB would give you “Index exceeds matrix”. The second way that would give you the same issue is, let’s use “mat” again which is once again a 4x4 matrix, say instead of calling a specific row and column, you just specify “mat(17)” sort of how you would specify a specific index for an array that has at least 17 indices. Well you can do this for matrices as well, except for this example since I said that “mat” is a 4x4 matrix that means that there is only a total of 16 indices.

       prob_f(i) = M(i) * M(i*?); % Here I take M(i) which is going to range from 1 to ?, then multiply it by the i*? which would give me the incremental 3rd value.
    end

for g:
    
    M(round(size(M,2)/?,1)) = []; % Here I find the middle element and delete it

for h: 
 
    lucky = 7 .* ????(3,4); % ???? is the function to use, look for MATLAB functions that create an array/matrix of a single value.

This works. If you want to do the array as a whole you can write a for loop around it. I just can't seem to find a way to get commas into the string rather than spaces.

&#x200B;

Long story short, use a while loop to handle the last few values.

&#x200B;

You can also opt to make a string array rather than a vector, and then write a csv. That would fix the comma problem.

I am going to try that now, hang on.

jkool702,"A couple ogf notes i didnt see mentioned in the other replies:

1. it is recommended hat you use `1i` and `1j` rather than `i` and `j`. The reason is because `i` and `j` can be set as variables, and if they are then `1+i` will not give the complex number with 1 real and 1 imaginary unit, but will rather add 1 to the variable `i`. Using `1+1i` always gives the correct result.

2. This probably wont matter unless you plan to transfer ther data outside of MATLAB, though there was a fairly large change in how matlab deals with imaginary numbers between R2017b and R2018a. R2017b and older stores imaginary numbers as 2 seperate arrays - the real; part is in one and the imaginary part is in the other. R2018a and newer uses a single interleaved array, meaning it stores the real part of the 1st element, then the imaginary part of the 1st element, then the real part of the 2nd element, etc.",1536964924.0

    X = [x1  x2  x3  x4  x5 ... xn];

    X = [x1       x6       x11           xn-4
         x2       x7       x12           xn-3

Once you have your matrix like that, you can see how easy it will be to compute the average of every 5 elements: simply call `mean(X,1)`.

Note that your vector `X` must be of the correct size to be turned into a rectangle--you'll probably have to pad the ends in order to make it such, and then treat the last column separately. For example, if you only have 3 values in your last column and you pad it with zeros, your mean will be too low. It's pretty easy to determine the adjustment factor for the last column, I'll give a bit of help:

Let's say our block `X` is 25 rows by 100 columns (e.g. you're averaging every 25 elements), but you only have 2482 elements. This means your final column will have 7 elements and 18 zeroes (assuming you padded with 0 in order to create square matrix).

When you compute the block mean, your final column with be 1/25 * (x_2476+x_2477+...+x_2482 + (18 zeroes)).

So what computed was

    (x_2476 + x_2477 + ... + x_2482)/25

when what you wanted was

     (x_2476 + x_2477 + ... + x_2482)/7

So the easy fix is to simply multiply the final mean value by `7/25`, and you should arrive at the correct value. I'll leave it to you to determine the formula for the multiplier in the general case.",1536930353.0

NedDasty,"For a crystal clear response, here's what's happening:

You're creating a vector like this:

    x = 1:10;

What's happening is the `1:10`algorithm is making something this:

    x = [1 1.9999999999999 2.99999999999999 3.99999999999999999 4.0000000001 ...

The reason for this is because the computer can't represent floating points to infinite precision, so things get rounded and numbers get slightly off. Note that this is only sometimes the case.

When you say ""locate the position where x == 3"", the computer can't do that; there is no location where x == 3.

There are two general ways to fix this:

1. Round `x`:

        idx = find(round(x,6)==3);

2. Find the element with the minimum distance to your target:

        [~,idx] = min(abs(x-3));",1536931085.0

maedhros11,"The error message produced here is very self-explanatory.  In general, before coming to a help board like here, you should try to interpret the error message (notice that Matlab will even tell you where in the code the error is occurring).  Think about what your outputs are (specifically, what are their sizes).

I ran the code that you have posted here, which still uses `std` and got no errors, but like you I received an error if I change `std` to `normalize`.  Regardless of which one you're using, the input is `data([(i- stperiod +1),i],j)` which is 2x1 vector (is this what you actually intended?).  If you look in the help functions, you'll see that when given a vector input, `std` returns a scalar:

>If A is a vector of observations, then the standard deviation is a scalar.

However, that's not the case for `normalize`:

>If A is a vector, then normalize operates on the entire vector

This means that if you call `N = normalize(A);` then the size of `N` will be the same as the size of `A`.  So for your code, for a given *i,j* pair you're trying to store the results of `normalize((data([(i- stperiod +1),i],j)));` (the left hand size) which is the same size as the input vector (in this case 2x1) in `Roller1(i,j)`(the right hand side), which is size 1x1.

​

**Edit:**

I think you have a little more work to do here in general - for example, I don't think that your indexing is achieving what you're actually trying to accomplish (is `data([(i- stperiod +1),i],j)` supposed to be a 2x1vector, or is it supposed to be 250x1?).  Also, I'm not sure that it's necessary to use nested loops for what you're doing; both `std` and `normalize` can work across a specified dimension so you should be able to account for your second dimension (the j-counter) without a loop.  But especially given the size mismatch you're experiencing, I wonder if you're misunderstanding what the normalize function actually does.  If you provide a little more information about your goals then I might be able to help.

bike0121,"The convergence of fmincon and other nonlinear optimization algorithms can be very sensitive to the initial guess. Are you starting from a “reasonably good” guess? As u/redditusername58 mentioned, you start at a point with constraint violations - while the optimizer can often work even with initial violations of constraints, I’d suggest starting where feasibility is already at zero (i.e. no collisions) if at all possible.

Also, a sanity check that I like to do when optimizing is to hold all but 2 or 3 variables fixed and then make a contour plot to visualize a lower-dimensional subspace of the design variables. I then check whether changing certain variables has the intended effect, and whether the optimization routine can correctly locate the optimum of that subspace. Visualization also can help you better understand what the design space looks like (i.e. is it multimodal, is it sufficiently smooth, convex...). If visualizing gives weird behaviour, I’ll often be able to tell whether I’ve done something wrong either in my code or in formulating the optimization problem.

Edit: Also, be careful if your objective value is always going to be on the order of 1e-27 (or anything below machine epsilon). This isn’t always an issue, but If it’s ever added or subtracted from a much larger number, there will be problems due to round-off error.",1536000550.0

1. Most of matlab seems to be tuned to run on intel hardware (e.g., as /u/trialofmiles mentions, MATLAB's BLAS implementation is Intel MKL).

2. A fair bit of MATLAB is still single threaded, and some single threaded processes (e.g., `fread` and `fwrite`) just dont have good parallelizable alternatives. The generally faster clock speed will help you a bit here.

3. If your codes utalize high-performance AVX (e.g., BLAS/LAPack operations), Intel's AVX units are much stronger, especially on skylake xeons (and skylake-x). Intel has a 2x advantage with AVX2+FMA, and a ~3.5x advantage for AVX512+FMA (depending on how good your cooling is, which determines how much the chip will downclock for AVX512)

4. This is the main one. MATLAB is not NUMA aware. This will cripple high-performance parallel function (e.g., BLAS) which expect  uniform memory access times.

WalterFStarbuck,"So I don't know about any real high level solution to what you're looking to do, but off the top of my head here's how I might go about it.

Break up your laminate area into a grid size - ask the user for this. It will basically be the resolution you want to have to deal with. Then you step through the laminate area one grid at a time. If the grid is more than X% dominated by a ply, then make the grid solid. I'd start with X = 50% but it may make sense to make it 75% or 25% or something in between. 

Alternatively, you might be able to use the image processing toolbox to find areas smaller than some user-set value and just fill them in. That would allow you to preserve the outer contour of the optimized ply shape. That honestly sounds like a more robust solution than breaking it up into a grid but a grid might be easier if you're cutting plies by hand. If you're working with pre-preg, you might be able to make printouts of the contours with a plotter and make cutting masks. You can do that to some extent with wet layups, but you'll have trouble keeping fibers aligned.

Edit: From a manufacturing standpoint, your fourth picture looks almost unusable. It is so scattered, that I would either go back to the optimization and tweak it or see what the difference is in just adding a ply all around.",1535926152.0

You're better off taking the memory hit up front.   The only way around that is cell arrays, which are arrays of pointers to other data objects.   You still have a penalty for resizing the cell, but it's only copying nn elements, not numel(C) elements.   Of course, not being contiguous in memory anymore means no optimized operations.

I made your input array `A` also be your output array `C` so that you don't have to hold both in memory at the same time.

However, changing `C` or `A` after declaring this pointer will force MATLAB to instantiate both as separate arrays in memory.

phsics,"> I'm really new to MATLAB, and firstly, I struggle a little with knowing where to put the '.' symbol before an operator. My understanding is that you put '.\*' before multiplying something with a vector.. So, please feel free to tell me if I've written my functions out incorrectly (syntactically wrong for MATLAB) for this question.

This is a good question to ask as a Matlab beginner. An operator preceded by '.' makes it an ""element-wise"" operation. Usually, operators are applied in a matrix sense. For instance, consider 

    a = [1 2]; 
    b = [3 4]; 
    c = a*b; 

This should give you an error since \* is trying to apply matrix multiplication on a and b, but their dimensions are incompatible. In contrast, if you did c = a\*b', b would first be conjugate transposed, so then it is multiplying a 1x2 matrix by a 2x1 matrix, so the operator makes sense and results in a 1x1 matrix (aka a scalar). In contrast, if you do c = a.\*b (note the dot), you will get a new 1x2 matrix, where the first element is equal to the product of the first element of a and the first element of b, the second element of c is the second element of a and the second element of b, and so forth. 

So use operators without the dot when you want them applied in a matrix sense. Precede them by a dot when you want them to be used on each element. ",1535421053.0
Mazokum,"Regarding the question about plotting the difference of the two functions, if you want to know where the functions intersect (where both functions have the same value at a given time) is the same as looking where the difference of the functions is 0 (if they have the same value m1-m2 at that point is 0).

However you are working with real numbers and you can't compare real numbers as equals when working numerically (since there is always some error). In this case you are looking for the place where m1-m2 == 0, but you are evaluating the function in a set of times (0.1, 0.2,...) and maybe in this set of times the difference never reaches 0 (but it reaches 0.0001). So you must establish a tolerance and say ""Ok, if the difference is less than 0.0001 I'll consider it to be 0"" and go for that point. Here is where the absolute value comes in, you have to find the place where

jkool702,"> floor(YYYYMMDD/100) = YYYY*100 + MM 

I think this is supposed to be

    YYYY = floor(YYYYMMDD/10000)
    MM = floor((YYYYMMDD - 10000*YYYY)/100)
    DD = YYYYMMDD - 10000*YYYY - 100*MM

With this filtering the data using `YYYY`, `MM`, `DD` and `time` is fairly straightforward. Say you want data from the first 4 months of 1969:

    dataSelected = data(YYYY == 1969 && MM <= 4,:)",1535474431.0

indestructible_deng,What have you written so far?,1535384204.0
2PetitsVerres,"I'm going to assume that your data is of type ""table"". (""modern"" data type for this kind of application, usually created with ""readtable"") To check that, you can try the following command: (anything after the '>>' is a command, that you will have to put in your script. The rest in the answer)

    >> class(dataset1)
    ans =
        'table'

If the answer is 'double' (instead of table, or anything else actually), you can adapt this example, but really, in your case it should be table. Just ask, if it's not table.

To select data from a table, there are two steps:

1. you need to know which rows have the certain value that you want.
2. you need to use this information to extract these rows.

Let's do it step by step. First we check the criteria. If I want to find which rows have 42 in the column 'A', I can do this:

    >> my_criteria = (dataset1.A == 42); % (the parenthesis are optional, I include them for readability)

This creates a my_criteria vector, containing (in your case) 286 boolean. You want a condition on the column A and B, so you will have to combine them with '&&' and '||' (boolean and and or operators. Check the documentation)

Second step is to use ""my_criteria"" to extract the good rows. This is called indexaction. In MATLAB, you can use a boolean vector to extract (index) values. So I want to extract values from dataset1. To do that, I use the indexation operation (that's the parenthesis) which needs to know 1. which rows to take, and 2. which columns to take (I will take all columns)

I can do this like this:

    >> dataset2 = dataset1(my_criteria, :);

We index the table dataset1 with parenthesis. Before the comma, I say which rows I want, by giving the vector that I have created before. It will extract all rows where the value is ""true"". After the comma, I say which column I want. Here, ':' means ""all columns"".

If this doesn't work, could you just copy paste the result of 

    >> dataset1(1:3,:)

so that we see the organisation of your data? (this will show us the three first lines of your dataset1)",1535374315.0
ziggittaflamdigga,"I'm assuming the 286\*6 in your question is the size of the matrix you're working with, I'm also assuming you're working with a table or a spreadsheet or something formatted, for example in a 4x5 matrix, like:

x = \[1, 2, 1, 1, 5

1, 1, 4, 5, 2

2, 4, 5, 6, 2

7, 2, 3, 4, 6\];

And you want to know where all of the 1's are. You could do:

binmat = x == 1;

And you should get a Boolean/logical array like this:

binmat = \[1, 0, 1, 1, 0

1, 1, 0, 0, 0

0, 0, 0, 0, 0

0, 0, 0, 0, 0\];

So, if your columns correspond to A, B, C, D, E and you want to store only those values, you could easily say:

A = binmat(:, 1);

B = binmat(:, 2);

And so on. Depending on what you actually need to do with it, you could do a few things.

If you need to count all of the values in all of the classes that correspond, you could use nnz(binmat). This will give you the total number of entries in the whole table that equal your input value (in this case it's 1) which will give you 5.

If you want to populate class A with only the values that meet your criteria, you could do A = binmat(:, 1) .\* x(:, 1) (period multiplication is used when you want to multiply two vectors or matrices element-wise, i.e. \[1, 2\] .\* \[3, 4\] should give \[3, 8\]. For A, you would get \[1; 1; 0; 0\]

If you need to add them all, you could do A\_sum = sum(binmat(:, 1) .\* x(:, 1) );

There are a few additional things you could do as well, but this is about all I can give you without knowing your specific problem and having a representative dataset suited to your application.

I should say, by explicitly declaring everything as a separate variable as I have, I'm not taking advantage of how MATLAB memory management works, so if you can reduce this to something like A = x(x(:, 1) == 1) and likely get the same result much faster, but I find that sometimes the less memory efficient method makes it easier for other people to read and understand your code or for you to remember exactly what you were doing at some point in the future.",1535507770.0

Let’s say you had 1000 samples of stereo audio; that would usually be a 1000x2 matrix. If you have some other single-channel sound that you’re trying to pan, one way to think is: you’ll have a 1000x1, you need a 1000x2, to add to that original. So you could, say, start with the first column (left channel) gradually scaling to zero. `scale_left = linspace( 1, 0, 1000 )’` . Note that prime; linspace produces row vectors, so you need to transpose.

Since you’ll want the same energy in your signal by the end most likely, you can just subtract the left from 1 to generate the right: `scale_right = 1-scale_left`. Then combine: `scaled = [ scale_left .* single_channel, scale_right .* single_channel ]`.

""2. Principal component analysis is a quantitatively rigorous method for achieving this simplification. The method generates a new set of variables, called principal components. Each principal component is a linear combination of the original variables. All the principal components are orthogonal to each other, so there is no redundant information. The principal components as a whole form an orthogonal basis for the space of the data. For example, in the cancer dataset, if you are using x predictors and then MATLAB PCA reduces this to y (<=x). These are not the actual data (columns) which you are using, these are derived columns out of the predictors by MATLAB. If you want to see the data of these 7 components out of the trained classifier, then you can use the following command:

ziggittaflamdigga,"Perhaps instead of a script you could write a custom function?

Provided enough additional information, I could write you something that should work for you fairly quickly (depending on the version of MATLAB you are running and how quickly you'd need it), but if you'd like to do it for yourself then writing your own custom function as a callback should work well.

For example:

your\_btn = uicontrol(arguments, ..., 'Callback', @yourfunction)

Regardless, if you used GUIDE or wrote it from scratch, there may be a couple of ways to do this.

Assuming you wrote it from scratch and it only provides a single function, this should be enough.

Make a new function called ""yourfunction.m"". Such as:

function yourfunction(argument)

disp(argument)

end

You could choose to explicitly print, as my example, or you could silently pass through this function if you were doing object-oriented code. Just make sure you put a "" < handle"" (without quotes) after your class definition if you want it to this feature. Inheriting from ""handle"" helps to ensure you're referring to and updating the same object. It's a bit more complicated than that, but additional info is available on Mathworks' website.

If you want arguments to your function, you may need to try something like @(x, y) yourfunction(x, y) as your callback. More information on this should be available if you search for MATLAB anonymous functions. This, combined with inheritance from the handle class, is particularly useful if you have other GUI objects that should be updated if the user updates a field and you when don't want to explicitly state ""obj = obj.doSomething"".

Inheriting from the handle class allows you to call a method, update the values stored in the class, and have it carry over without many complications.

Assuming you worked with GUIDE, you should be able to:

1.) Launch GUIDE by typing ""guide"" (without quotes) into the Command Window. You can create a new UI or modify an existing one.

2.) Create a button by clicking the Push Button icon.

3.) Launch the Inspector tool by double clicking on your (new or old) button.

3.) Create a callback function by finding the Callback field in Inspector and clicking the pencil and paper icon.

4.) Navigate to the function that GUIDE  created for you (should still work if it already existed).

5.) Write the MATLAB code that you want to execute on pressing the button.

Huwbacca,"Late to the party, however...I'm a cognitive neuroscientist and I live inside matlab.

The number one thing that helped me learn matlab - no expert, but also pretty damned handy with it by the standards of my field - have a project.

I am a terrible textbook learner. Going through abstract exercises or trying to learn stuff by rote is totally impossible for me. Without a  clear, actionable goal I struggle so hard to learn stuff. As soon as I had tasks that I had to/wanted to achieve it became easier because I no longer had to think about ""trying to learn matlab"" (which is hard and demotivating to me).

Also, one thing that's great about having a project that contains multiple types of problems is that it will allow you to overcome a big problem that a lot of textbooks don't cover, which is how to think programmatically.

There is a little bit of art to being able to dissect your idea and abstract what programmatic features will be needed.

The order of operations to achieve the goal, how the logic would have to work.

Particularly when you are using matlab for data manipulation, you should really aim to try and visualise each stage of the data 'journey' and how it changes.

My recommendation if you're in cog-sci... Programme a cross-modal go-no-go task... Make an experiment where people have to respond to a blue flash or a high pitch sound, and not respond to any other colour or sound. Record the data, then analyse it from like 3 people.

This will serve you great if you can get this even half working, and once you know what programmatic steps you must take, I guarantee you it won't be long til you're able to google your way through most questions.

saliciouscrumb,"Based upon what you're describing, I assume that your initial track map has x position,y position, local radius, target local speed, and time steps between each point as its parameters in a matrix. I'll refer to this as a ""track map matrix"". As the car approaches a new x/y position, it uses that local speed as a set point to determine whether it should be accelerating or braking.

I'm not sure about how complex your vehicle dynamics model is, so I'll simplify and call the limit of your vehicle's acceleration as ""available traction force"". The maximum discrete acceleration or acceleration in a straight line is (available traction force)*(time step). I'll call this the ""speed delta"".

In most racing series (damn you formula D) a driver must brake on a straight prior to corner entry so they don't exceed the maximum speed prior to sliding. Drivers will know where these braking zones are ahead of time rather than try to predict them on the fly.

You can do something similar by adding braking zones prior to corners within your track map matrix. Try to run a loop that compares your local speed to the previous local speed in your matrix. If the delta between your two speeds is too high then your vehicle will overshoot and that previous local speed needs to be reduced so that it is equal or lesser than the speed delta. Run this loop over your entire track map matrix and you've now created braking zones.

I hope this helps.

Most of those are fine, so long as n and X are positive integers.  However, \`factorial(n-X)\` requires n to be greater than X.  When you call X=0:40 and n=20, then n-X will be negative for half the X values.

Try plotting X=0:20.  For the third plot, you may need to change X=0:40.

Weed_O_Whirler,"`lsqnonlin` and `fsolve` are made for different purposes, but in the case where your data is ""perfect"" (that is, it is simply a set of equations), then they will essentially do the same thing. 

`fsolve` is for solving a set of equations, like what you have. It's what I'd expect you to use in this situation. 

`lsqnonlin` is a numerical solver used to fit data. It is designed to work with noisy data. If your data had noise in it, `fsolve` wouldn't work because you couldn't actually drive the solution to zero. That's why `lsqnonlin` minimizes the square of the error, so that it gets the error as close to zero as possible. If you don't have any noise, the least square error is zero, thus the same as `fsolve`",1532018012.0

First, I was trying to overload indexing in a MATLAB class I was working on.

The documentation and examples I could find were no help at all.  MATLAB's oop is a mess in general, but handling indexing is a nightmare for anything non-trivial.

Second, someone came to me because his plots weren't making sense.  After hours of stepping through the code I finally figured out that a small fraction of his results only had one trial in them.  This led a function to wrongly re-interpret those trials as vectors, which was leading it the code silently doing the completely wrong math on those results. 

Third, I had to update code that was written for an 8-year-old version of MATLAB that we no longer had available.  This code used several functions that were fine at the time, but had since been removed by MATLAB.

2. make the message all lower case, but figure out where the upper case letters or special characters are (using isstrprop as you already are),
3. literally add the key to the message but modulo-ly, (play around with `'a' + 'b'`, or `mod('a' + 'b', 'a')`),
4. Convert things back to characters with char,
5. Use logical indexing to make the upper case letters upper case again, e.g.:

`index = isstrprop(mes, 'upper');`

`key(index) = upper(key(index));`

You'd have to make special consideration for the spaces and punctuation, figuring out how to insert them into your key (everything would be much better if you could just ignore them though, again using logical indexing).",1531494269.0
EphemeralMemory,"What are you trying to do? This post is vague.

imfuse works with 2D images, either greyscale or RGB from what I can tell. If you have 3D images, you have a sequence of images. You can take two slices of that and imfuse them. TO buld on that, you can take an ordered amount two different slices (each individually), imfuse them, to create a 3D stack, or slice by slice from two different 3D stacks imfuse them slice by slice.

You may see where I'm going from here, but 4D images typically have a forth dimensional component besides spatial location. You can imfuse all you like, but if you want a multidimensional stack (it looks like) you may have to reduce it down to a 2D image, imfuse it with another of your choosing, then build the multidimensional image slice by slice.

So yeah you can do it, it probably isn't even that hard, but the way you do it may have to be slice by slice, and you're going to have to make sure what you're doing makes sense.

* Object oriented programming in MATLAB
* Construction of graphical user interfaces and dynamic programs
* If you are familiar with C, look into MEX programming

will import all of the variables into a struct C, whose field names are equal to the original variable names. For example, if you had previously saved the variable `x` into `cloes.mat`, you can access it with `C.x`.

Note that, because Matlab uses [copy on write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write), you won't really see a performance hit by doing the following sequence of commands:

    >> C = load('cloes.mat');

Weed_O_Whirler,"You shouldn't name variables the same name as your functions. Since variables are indexed using the same method as function arguments are passed, when MATLAB sees `xp(1,2)` for instance, it doesn't know if you are handing in 1 and 2 into the function `xp` or are grabbing the first row and second column of the variable `xp`. If you fix that problem, you might fix the `t` problem. 

Also, your function definition implies you are handing in `t` but at no point do you use it, it's just being assigned by the `ode` function. Are you actually handing in `t`? If so, are you hoping to use it somewhere? And if you're not, you're going to get an error because you defined your function to take it. ",1531190864.0

`xp(1)= x(2);`

`xp(2)= x(1)+(0.2 * (x(1))^3);`

These lines would simply compute the value of xp for a given value of x.

If I understood right, what you should do is first define the function xp(t,x). Then, you use ode45 to solve it.

Something like this:

Put this in the xp\_func.m file. (I changed the name as a function cannot have the same name as a variable)

`function` `xp = xp_func(t,x)`

`xp=zeros(2,1);`

`xp(1)= x(2);`

`xp(2)= x(1)+(0.2 * (x(1))^3);`

`end`

Now that your function is defined, you can call ode45 like this (either from a separate script file or directly from the command line)

`[t,x]= ode45(@xp_func, [0,20], [0,1]);`

`plot(t,x(:,1));`

Optrode,"Start with the scholarpedia article on spike sorting. Then look for a spike sorting package. I think KiloSort would perhaps be appropriate to your data. This is not likely to be an easy task, seek help.",1531013939.0
Optrode,"To elaborate further:

If the data you're working with is in the format you say it is (data from each channel is the same size), what you have is data that has not gone through spike detection. Now, this is all assuming that what you're trying to do is detect and measure the activity of individual neurons. Doing so requires finding spikes (action potentials) in the signals for each channel, and then sorting them into groups representing different neurons (hopefully). Again, the Scholarpedia spike sorting article explains this in some detail. That article also explains how some kind of filtering step usually comes before spike detection.. I don't know if your data are already filtered or not, but if not you may need to filter each channel before going further.

Anyway, the process of spike detection and sorting is fairly complex, and teaching yourself to do it via MatLab would take months at the very least (it took me the best part of a year). That's why I recommend using a pre-existing package like KiloSort. KiloSort is designed for data like yours, which comes from MEAs. KiloSort will make use of data from multiple channels at once, whereas many more traditional methods will do the sorting process to each channel individually, or at most in groups of four, which isn't as effective. 

Now, if your objective isn't to isolate individual neurons, then nothing I've said applies. But I rather suspect that's what you want to do, in which case everything you're doing so far is quite useless. I have no idea why you want to make a sparse matrix. I'm afraid it really sounds like you're chasing your tail.

Incidentally, what is your background in neuroscience? Do you have a firm understanding of the basics of action potentials, etc.?

Disadvantages Matlab:

1. The matrix handling is much more intuitive in python than in matlab [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) removes restriction of the default 2 dimension behaviour of matrices found in matlab. The Scipy website summarizes scipy as

> ... a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.

Scipy seems to be inspired from matlab. Their graph plotting module is named matplotlib.

2. Matlab is paid software. Students may not be able to try it on their own at home unless the school gets an agreement to have 100% discount for personal computers of students. You can choose GNU Octave as a software with same syntax and functions as matlab that provides freedom to use it the way you want to without any stringent restrictions that come with academic licenses.

3. Literate programming essential to teaching new programming languages has its own limitations in matlab which isn't present in other free software alternatives like python due to the wide range of interest of users of python.

4. Matlab libraries (including ones that programmers write) can behave slightly differently in windows and unix due to the way the operating systems handle files with regards to case-sensitivity.

5. The IDE uses Java which is seems to be resource hungry.

Advantages of Matlab:

1. Matlab documentation is very easy to understand, with detailed examples.

2. Matlab IDE has everything that a beginner would need.

For your first error:

> Cannot connect to ROS master at http://10.0.0.1:11311

This is telling you that it's failing to establish a TCP connection on port 11311 at the host 10.0.0.1 using the HTTP protocol as the data layer.

Why it's failing could be a whole slew of reasons, but I am going to guess that the firewall is blocking incoming TCP connections on port 11311 on PC1.

First we should validate that there is an application (in this case ROS) actually listening on port 11311 for TCP connections using the HTTP protocol on the PC that is running ROS. To do that we can type this into a browser on the PC that is running ROS:

    http://localhost:11311

If ANYTHING shows up, that means that ROS is definitely waiting for a connection, and most likely there is a firewall rule blocking incoming TCP connections on this port.

If nothing shows up and the page times out, you will have to see why ROS is not accepting incoming connections.

The second error is expected as most likely the second PC has no idea that the hostname ""Deepcam"" should translate to IP ""10.0.0.1"". You can define this in the hosts file on the second PC so that you can do rosinit('Deepcam'); However, without figuring out the reason for your first error, doing this will simply cause rosinit('Deepcam'); to return the same error as your first error.

Do you expect to ""see"" a different FFT when using a different sin frequency but not plotting vs. frequency? (You may need to review how to generate the frequency axis when using an FFT. You may want to plot the summation of the two sin functions albeit with a frequency axis.)

Similarly for the summation... you may want to look into the discrete interval you're using for time (2pi) vs. the difference in your two frequency components (1 vs 2). For example, if I just do the following, the resultant FFT is *visually* different, but could be more pronounced if the x axis was generated with more points OR the frequency difference was significantly larger than '1':

    >> y=cos(x);
    >> y_fft = fft(y);
    >> plot(x,fftshift(y_fft))
    >> y = 0.5 * sin(x) + 0.5 * cos(2 * x);

Sclark7,"Im currently working on a research project regarding battery balancing topologies. I am new to matlab/simulink and any help would be **greatly** appreciated. I've been working on this for a couple weeks now and my research is dependent on this model for a basis to compare other topologies to. Unfortunately I can't get this circuit to operate as intended and cannot progress to my research until I can get an appropriate simulation.

Description:

This circuit operates by sensing the SOC and operating switches based on the inputs fed into the matlab function. Ideally, when the SOC is greater than the arbitrary threshold (1.8&#37;) it should open the controlled current switch (second from top) and close bleeder 1 or bleeder 2's respective switch/switches. i.e. if B1 SOC is greater than B2's by 1.8&#37; or more, the current switch will open and the top switch and top far right switch will both close, allowing the excess voltage to be burned off by bleeder 1. Same for B2 except that bleeder 2's switch will be closed.

Problems:

1. My initial conditions for SOC for B1 and B2 are 60&#37; and 40&#37; respectively, which should indicate to my system that the controlled current switch should open at t=0 and I expected to see the voltage decrease in B1's scope (shown in top left) at the start of the simulation....clearly this is not what happens.
2. The current through my controlled switch remains at a constant 17.5A throughout the simulation...so this switch obviously never receives a signal to open.
3. The nominal voltage for each battery is 36V, however the initial voltage for both B1 and B2 begins at 40V and approaches 80V as the simulation progresses. If the SOC and voltage are proportional, shouldn't B1's initial voltage be roughly 22 volts? (36\*.6) .

\*\* one error was fixed, forgot to increase the capacitance of my batteries so I no longer have oversaturated batteries. Simulation begins with each around 39V and approaches a max of 40V.\*\*

tMHA will consist of values sent to an external application. In the future, a separate program will be generatevalues in the tMHA string template format, and I need to convert into a matrix for manipulation before converting it back to the tMHA format. 

The first strategy to get from tMHA > matrix was using regexp to extract all spaces, semi-colons, and digits, and then a num2str to turn it into a manageable matrix.






    temp=tMHA(regexp(tMHA,'[\d\s;]'));
    n_gains = str2num(temp);


The second strategy was to play dumb and str2num the tMHA. Turns out str2num respects the role of semi-colons and brackets, and delivers the matrix I want perfectly formatted...





    n_gains = str2num(tMHA);


So for all of you who want the sanity check, run this command and see what you get...

for part 2, yes. See the below code as a start:

    uniqueIDs = unique(data(:,3));

2. temporary full time usage:  you legitimately cant afford the capital to build a sufficiently powerful system, and whatever computing in being done will make you enough money to cover the amazon server costs + more so that you can build up the needed capital.

If you are routinely in need of l""high power / high memory computing"" that will be in use a large percent of the time, the cost of cloud computing will very quickly outweight the cost of locally setting things up.I imagine this is especially true for those in academia, since most of the costs other than the upfront cost (electricity, tech support) are (probably?) covered by the institution (I would think this is the case anyhow,but am not 100% sure).

Some tips for matlab usage:

1. In general, I feel it is best to ""explicitly parallelize between different NUMA nodes, but to use functions with built-in parallelization (matrix operations, fft's, convolution, etc) for everything that is run on a particular NUMA node. In general, I found performance from using multiple NUMA nodes at the same time in things like matrix operations to be barely (if at all) better than a single NUMA node's performance. I usually did this by starting up a given instance using `numactl`. This requires implementing some system to manage different instances, but also bypasses the 12-worker limit of the parallel computing toolbox. It also tends to be much more memory efficient, since there is no ""sending a copy of the data to each worker"" that can happen with explicit parallelization if you arent careful about variable splicing.

* Note: The documentation for the parallel computing toolbox says ""up to 1024 cores"", but fails to mention that for anything over 12 you need a distributed computing license, which scales in cost based on how many workers you are using. IDK exactly how much the high end prices are. [this](http://inside.mines.edu/UserFiles/File/ccit/software/Matlab%20price%20list.pdf) (see page 3) is literally the only reference I could find, that shows (in 2013, at the colorado school of mines) that a 400-worker license was $23,500. This is only one data point for one scenario, but its probably safe to assume the high-worker licenses are ""really expensive""

2. Take the time to create a fast I/O function for your specific data type if it doesnt already exist.  I deal with SEG-Y data, and the best data loading tool (part of the open-source SeisLab 3.02) was loading data (plus implementing an IBM float --> ieee float conversion) at 30-50 MB/s. It took me over a year of on-and-off work, and it still isnt 100% done, but i have an I/O function that runs 4-5x for loading+converting the data. 

* something else that is still a work in progress, but that I thik will help a lot, is asyncronous data loading / writing. `fread` and `fwrite` run pretty fast in Matlab, but are inherently single threaded, and so if you have to wait for them you are not using a large percent of the comopute potential of the system especially true for xeon based systems like the one you are probably using to process terabyte- sized data). The idea is that, assuming you can split data into ""blocks"" and dont need all 5 terabytes for every computation (if you do then good luck with that...) then you can siumultaniously  dedicate 1 thread to loading the next block to be processed, one thread to writing the data that finished being processed to disk, and all the rest working on the actual processing. If you are careful, you can probably get away with this requiring 2x the raw data storage (+ whatever is needed to actually run computations without going into swap): one for the data being processed, and one for the combined reading/writing, where one instance writes data and the other then overwrites those exact memory addresses with new data (youll have to be very careful with syncing these up).

3. dont overdue vectorization. Vectorizing something into a matrix operation is (almost) always good, since BLAS is rather good at efficient memory management. Vectorizing with `bsxfun`, on the other hand, uses up a lot of memory, and you will be far better breaking up the operations a little bit then trying to run a `bsxfun` operation on a huge segment of data. Vectorize as much as you can without causing operations to dip into swap space, but as soon as you pass that point your speed will almost immediately slow to a crawl.

Hopefully these will be somewhat useful. 

PS using tall arrays and data stores is another possibility. These probably work quite well, but tie you down to Matlab. If you are using matlab as an environment to test and work out the bugs for something, and perhaps use it in practice a few times, but ultimately the code may be redone in another language that offers better performance and portability, then I would avoid these.",1529782352.0

screeperz,"Not too sure what you mean by connecting to servers. That said, if you are completely new to doing work on remote servers, learn to use the `ssh` protocol (it is the most common). Based on your description, it is also likely that you might have a cluster that crunches the numbers for whatever simulations you perform.

Matlab has its own scheduler, but there are many of them out there (I personally use slurm). Given that you don't have a lot of information on what you will be specifically working with, I wouldn't worry about learning how to connect to servers and configuring job schedulers (they are mostly designed for you not to worry about them).

Learning to use Matlab however is something I can help you with. First of all, its expensive, so make sure you get a copy from the University (most of them purchase Matlab licenses) for free if you can. The Matlab application is (among other things) an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which means you should be able to do just about everything from that one application (editor, debugging, documentation). The language itself and syntax is extremely beginner friendly and I highly recommend learning using the `doc <some-confusing-function-or-object>` functionality to better understand the language. Take on some small but easy programming tasks and implement them in Matlab.

TL;DR

* You might to find out a bit more about how you will utilize servers in your research. That said, I wouldn't worry too much about learning to use them.
* Try to get Matlab for free from the University.
* Matlab is a beginner friendly language with excellent documentation (`doc` is a lifesaver). Start by learning the syntax (find small but easy programming tasks and create a Matlab script perform it).

jkool702,"> My assumption is that at run-time MATLAB ""compiles"" everything such that any changes made after that point make no effect but I am not certain.

As I understand it, this is correct, but not the whole story. MATLAB uses a ""just-in-time"" (JIT) compiler, which (as the name suggests) compiles code on the fly as needed. It isnt compiled in the same way that, say, C/C++/fortran code is (where the entire code is compiled before runtime). This means:

1. You could have a function that is already running but not fully compiled, and as such changing a value might still have an effect. I could imagine it resulting is different parts of the code using different values for the same variable depending on if the code was compiled before of after the variable value changed

2. Theres no guarantee that, just because code has already been compiled, it wont get re-compiled later, even during the same run. If you have a code segment that only gets run evextremely infrequently and the rest of the code is long and demanding, I could imagine MATLAB removing the compiled code from memory. Maybe it puts it in swap, maybe it decided that recompiling later is better than spending time dealing with swap space. I believe you could also force this to happen by doing something like

.

    save allVarsTemp.mat -v7.3
    clear all
    load allVarsTemp.mat
    delete allVarsTemp.mat

*usually* changing values after the function has started running wont matter, but I have absolutely encountered a few experiences where changing the variable did effect an already-running function

angrmgmt00,"Pretty sure all posts here start at 0 karma.

As for your issue, a couple of things to try:

1. Initialize your variables with `syms`
2. Declare them as functions of `t`
3. (bonus) You can use 4 spaces before text on a blank line to display as code here.

So, try something like this:

    syms t z1(t) z2(t) z3(t) z4(t) zfin(t)

    z1 = 6*cos(10*pi*t - pi/2);
    z2 = 4*cos(10*pi*t + pi/6);
    z3 = 2*sin(24*pi*t);
    z4 = 8*sin(24*pi*t - pi/2);

    zfin = z1 + z2 + z3 + z4;

    simplify(zfin)

Also, the more you do with MATLAB, the better off you are doing it with scripts.  That way you don't have to retype (or press up, up, up, up... etc.) every time you want to try something again or modify it just a little.

FrickinLazerBeams,"I'm addicted to camelCase, even though I think it's not great.

I hate super abbreviated variable names. It was the convention in the very old days when storage and memory were at a premium, but it's impossible to make sense of code where the variable names are all like pibc, pilc, nvo, etc.

Variables should have descriptive names, like pointsInBaseCoords, pointsInLocalCoords, normalVectorsOrthogonal. That way you can read code and generally make sense of things.

i and j should never be loop indices, because i = j = sqrt(-1). That looks, in Matlab, as silly as using pi as a loop index.

In simple loops, especially non-nested or when the outer or inner of a nested loop is very brief, n, m, and k make good indices and are also commonly used for indexing in mathematical notation. For more complex or long loops, indices should have descriptive names, like vectorIDX (which might index a variable like vectorList), or imgID (which might index something like imgFilenameList{imgID} or imgStack(:, :, imgID)), so it's easy to know what it indexes. As a rule of thumb, if the loop is long enough that its `for... ` statement isn't visible on screen when you're editing the bottom of the loop, your index should have a descriptive name instead of a single letter. 

Equals signs should have spaces before and after. Arguments to functions should have spaces after commas. Indexes to arrays should not have spaces after commas if they're trivial, but should have spaces if they're complex, so arrayName(:,:) or arrayName(n,m) is okay for simple indexing, and arrayName(rowFunction(arg1), colIDX, :) is fine for complex indexing.

Binary operations in long mathematical expressions should be formatted to make the form of the expression visible. So simple sub-expressions can be done without spaces, especially if they're repeated. Larger expressions should be spaced out, like

    (n-1) * (exp(-i*pi*theta) - phaseOffset(theta, x))

Indenting should use the automated pattern the editor promotes. Hit ctrl-a ctrl-i to be sure.

Editor warnings should be resolved unless you have a **very** good reason not to.

Use line continuation to format long argument lists and matrix definitions.

It has its limitations though. 

C# / .NET I find to be a lot better for UI development, and larger applications with multiple contributing developers. Really prefer an enforced static type system and OOP at the forefront of the language for that sort of thing. 

Then for really high performance simulation, ultimately you end up in some native-compiled language like C++. Or C-style libraries wind up being more portable and usable across environments.

There is a subtle distinction here... the window should start and end at zero in a periodic sense.  You can review the Harris paper for this finer point.

> How do I chose the sampling frequency or the resolution frequency (as some call it apparently) of the FFT ?

Your sample frequency (i.e. sample rate) would refer to how often you sample your analog signal, which should twice the bandwidth of your signal.  The resolution bandwidth refers to how long of a record you should gather before you do perform your analysis.  Resolution bandwidth will be determined by how close your sinusoids can be in frequency for you to resolve them.  

> Is it possible to identify significant high frequency components (frequencies that have a high amplitude when plotting the amplitude vs frequency diagram) by using a threshold value ? If yes then how much should this be ? If no then what should I do ?

This is a legitimate way to use the fft.  You should review the findpeaks function in matlab.  This function is specifically taylored for this scenario.

Your threshold should be based upon the application, your signal conditions such as signal to noise ratio, and your tolerance for false positives and false negatives.

Use a taper anytime you have data that suddenly ends at the data edge. Otherwise you add in (often significant) Fourier noise.

Personally, I use cosine / Tukey windows for this purpose.

I'm including a little code to generate this and a small example showing why they are useful. In the example, the signal has only a single frequency (i.e., is purely sinusodial) meaning that, ideally, the fft should produce 2 spikes, one at `+f` and one at `-f` (where `f` if the frequency of the sinusoid). One example tapers the data edges before doing the fft, the other doesnt. Which looks more like the correct ""2 spikes"" result?

yourfavoritemusician,"I don't have matlab on my pc anymore (so i can't try out anything), but I should (hopefully) be able to help you on your way (at least a bit).

You didn't mention fs. This is your sample rate. So when you double your sample rate your sample plays twice as fast (try it out with your origional sound sample: soundsc(fmOut,fs) vs. soundsc(fmOut,2*fs)).

so if you have a (theoretical) sample rate of 100 samples per seconds. Than 60 samples would be 0.6 second.
So 'delay' is the amount of seconds you want to shift.
'd' is then the amount of samples you want to shift.

the line:

    y = zeros(size(fmOut));
Just makes a vector of the same *size* of 'fmOut' and fills it with *zeroes*. This is called preallocating. There are cases where you can remove it and it will still run. But Matlab will give a warning.
Preallocating is done so your computer can resever a bit of memory of exactly the right size. If you don't preallocate your pc would have to move all bits of memory to somewhere else every time you make your dataset bigger (which is incredibly slow).

A delay uses samples from 0.6 seconds ago and repeats them. What would happen if you start your signal (time=0). Where does your program get their samples from?
The line:

    y(1:d) = fmOut(1:d);
Is to solve that problem.

Now the for loop:

Check out the [matlab page](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/for.html). I think there is still a lot you can learn on for loops from there. 
The trick here is to just write it out by hand. Make your own signal (for example fmOut=[0,1,2,1,0], y is all zeroes and pretend that d=1). What would happen in your loop?

With regards to alpha and the images you showed:

You shouldn't really trust the images for these high frequency signals. If you zoom in/out you'll probably see them deform quite a lot. That's because the signal has more datapoints than your image can simply show. It's better to either zoom in (a lot!) or use some signal processing stuff.

But if you think about it: with alpha = 1: how high would you expect the amplitude your delay sample to be? Would it be exactly as high as your original sample? Or would it be slightly higher/lower? (as in your image). (Hint: Has your original signal died out completely when your delayed signal starts?).
",1529240893.0
exlipsiae,"Adding to the answers by u/yourfavoritemusician, I've tested the program and it actually works like it should. The issue with your echo part being greater than 1 can still very much happen though. From looking at the line 

>y(i) = fmOut(i) + alpha*fmOut(i-d);   

you can see it depends on the decay of your original signal and the delay you choose. If by d seconds (so your delay) it still has a high enough amplitude and you add the attenuated echo from the beginning of your signal (alpha*fmOut(i-d)), it might just have a higher amplitude than it should. To emphasize: [see the jump in amplitude right after your delay time if your input is just a continuous 1](https://ibb.co/bZpbqJ).  
Your program just assumes a natural sound with a certain decay in amplitude after a short time is used. It worked with the one I used, which was just a short generic sound file of a bell I found online, but apparently not for yours. 
Also, be careful to use the correct sampling frequency, the one your original sound is sampled at. You can just grab it like this

>[fmOut, fs] = audioread('bell.wav');

EDIT: btw I've just noticed your plots don't actually show your signals over the time, but over the sampling points. You can fix this by writing plot(t, y) instead, where t should be like t=0:1/fs:length(y)-1/fs.  That way you can actually see, where your delay and your echoed part start.

jkool702,"There are a few reasons why allocating a zero array in matlab doesnt necessairly mean you have room for it

1) Memory optimization. First, I'm fairly sure Matlab doesnt actually assign memory to the array until you write something to it. You can force it by using `zeros(...,'like',data) + ones(1,'like',data) - ones(1,'like',data);`

2) memory compression. Even if matlab actually requests the space, the OS typically has memory compression enabled by default, so it goes ""oh look, a billion zeros all in a row! I can compress the shit outta that!""

3) enough space for data =/= space to do stuff with it. This is especially true since MATLAb tends to ""play it safe"" and make extra copies of stuff when you try and change it until it is 100% sure you wont need the old version. As a rule of thumb, id say that if you want to run an operation of X MB of data, you need at minimum 3*X MB of storage : 1x for the data input, 1x for the data output, 1x for doing stuff with the data. This still isnt enough for every case, but its a decent ballpark imo. Note that this means that, as you become memory constrained, vectorization at the really big scale does more harm than good. Split up operations into the biggest data chunks that can be run without dipping into swap space, but no bigger.

> should I try to be more explicit in my calling of parallel implementation?

IMO: absolutely not.

For one, as someone else mentioned, explicit multi-threading uses up a lot more memory, which you dont have.

I have a bit of a different take on how Matlab runs code. Another commenter said that Matlab isnt suited to handle problems like this, and they are absolutely right. But, that isnt the whole story. See, in a lot of ways, nothing actually ""runs"" *inside* of Matlab. It doesnt matter what it is you are running - if you pause the code and in the debugger go to the bottom of the function stack, 100% of the time there is a call to an external binary. Matlab's sole purpose is to make setting up these function calls more user friendly, not necessairly faster. So, my personal design goal tends to be to figure out how to get into these external function calls as fast as possible, and have them do as much of the setup as possible. 

You *can* explicitly set up things like parallelization, but there is basically a 0% chance you set it up in MATLAB more efficiently than, say, Intel's MKL library does whenever you call a matrix operation, or the FFTW library does when you call an fft operation. 

If you manage to get your code to spend 95% of its time executing in these external high performance libraries, then (basically by definition) running the code in Matlab is at most 5% slower than running it in a ""fast"" language like C or fortran, and that is assuming the ""fast"" language sets things up instantly, since if it is going to call the same function you are calling (or, rather, Matlab is calling for you), once you hand things off to the function things move the same speed regardless.

The only possible exception ive found to this is in regards to I/O: `fread` and `fwrite` are about as fast as MATLAB can read and write data, but these are fundamentally single threaded. Setting these up to run asynchronously with some general data processing workflow (i.e., 1 thread is always writing the already processed data, one thread is always reading data to be processed, and the rest are doing the processing) seems like it would be quite beneficial.

vectors-bro,"Hi there. NetCDF files are valid HDF5 files. (See https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000332.shtml ) I’d recommend using a HDF5 library to read the data. I’m not sure what file format you mean by .img as there are many formats that use that extension, but typically the .img file stores raw bytes. Typically these formats have an associated header file that describes how much data is in the .img file, what the numeric representation is, and what ordering the bytes have (ie fortran/C or BIL/BSQ/BIP or ieee-be/ieee-le). Lots of options. 
As for an actual HDF5 library, I prefer PyHDF5 and python. 
In matlab, .mat files are actually HDF5 files, so you may be able to directly open the files with ‘load()’. 
To save the data in the .img, you’ll probably want to use ‘fwrite()’ to write raw bytes to a file.

For learning matlab, Mathworks has many tutorials that are useful. If you do not have a strong need for linear algebra, I would strongly recommend considering learning python. It is becoming increasingly used instead of Matlab depending on your specific field(and is free).

It looks like this is 1D so it is easy (and almost certainly interpolation). The big question is, do you understand what you're even trying to solve?

You are looking for coefficients of a curve:

   F =  c(1) + c(2)*x^1 + c(3)*x^2 + ... + c(n) * x^(n-1)

You need to solve for `c`. You have `n` unknowns (`c = [c1,c2,...,cn]`) and `n` pieces of information (e.g. at `x = 3, F = 5`). Now you put that into a matrix form.

    A*c = f

`A` is a Vandermonde matrix. It is essentially `A(i,j) = x(i).^j` (careful. I may have that flipped). Assuming it is well posed, you can invert the matrix via `c = A\f`.

That is the theory. Before you continue, try to understand where this came from. And then try to build your own Vandermonde matrix (again, I may have had my definitions flipped). Or, use Matlab's tool but *read the documentation* to make sure you understand the order.

for varvalue =1:50

You don’t have to change anything in how you call the sim command.

The question you’re really asking is less to do with matlab and more about basic curve fitting. Do it by hand, without matlab first. 

Start with the endpoints. How can you fit an exponential function to the points (0,0) and (1,1)? Remember you’re initially looking for something of the form ` y=a*exp(b*x) `

Once you have the correct function, then you can start to put it into code. But you have to start with an understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve - linspace can give you a vector you can use as x, but it won’t give you anything other than linearly spaced points unless you know how to tell it to do that. ",1528454671.0
,"I think you got it right with the last approach if I understand correctly. Linspace gives you a linear sequence from a to b, which gives you a domain fr your function. exp(x) gives you the exponential function values (i.e., image) over that domain. E^0 is indeed 1 and E^1 is indeed around 2.8.

If you do (assuming Fs is your sampling rate, into how many section you divide the line from 0 to 1 on the x-axis),

x = linspace (0, 1, Fs)
y = exp(x)
plot(x, y)

then you should see a nice exponential curve (cant test it at the moment myself though).",1528454647.0

Weed_O_Whirler,"So, looking at your code sample you posted, there are a couple of easy things you can do which will help a little. 

First, a lot of your `for` loops are unnecessary. For instance

    for i = 1:n
        SlrCH_tot(i) = SlrCM_avgB(i)*60
    end

can be replaced by

    slrCH_tot = SlrCM_avgB*60

You have a lot of similar `for` loops in your code you can replace. This won't buy you a lot, but some. Even your other loops with math in them you can say, for example `WP6inAVG = (Wp6inMIN + WP6inMAX)/2` and get them all in one go. 

Second, when you're creating all of your zero arrays, don't keep calling `length` over and over again. Every call takes some processor. Instead, say `n_days = length(days)` and `batt_day = zeros(n_days,1)` (and actually, you might save some time not calling the `zeros` function more than once. I'm unsure but worth checking if `batt_days = zeros(length(days), 1)` followed by `rain_day = batt_days` might be a little faster. I think the `zeros` function has unnecessary overhead. 

Third, similar to above, save off your logical indexing one time. e.g `idx_d = IDX == d` then say `batt_day(d) = mean(batt(inx_d,end))`

Those are just the pure MATLAB tricks for you. I didn't spend a lot of time actually looking at the math you're doing, but one thing is see if anything you're calculating MATLAB has a built in function for. The more built-ins you use, the faster your code will run. ",1528403624.0

lucasdwi,"There is a variable for mscohere that does exactly this. It would be right before your sampling rate in your example. So you'd want something like this:
    
    [Cxy,F] = mscohere(detrend(x),detrend(y),[],[],0.1333,42);


However, if you're also interested in the frequencies around 0.1333 Hz, then you can give mscohere a range of values that includes your target. For example, this:
   
    [Cxy,F] = mscohere(detrend(x),detrend(y),[],[],0.1320:0.0001:0.1340,42);
would give you coherence estimates from 0.1320 Hz to 0.1340 Hz in 0.0001 Hz steps.

For more detail, the Documentation for mscohere is pretty good for this question. For example, [this](https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/mscohere.html#bvi4lxm_sep_shared-f) describes the variable, f, that you need to play with.

How much data do you have to compute coherence with (i.e. length of x and y)? I only ask because the resolution of coherence estimates depends on your windowing (which, with the code you posted here, will default to 8 Hamming windows with 50% overlap), especially at such low frequencies.

First, fit a circle to the curve (look up circle fit by taubin for a function). 
Then calculate the polar coordinates of the pixels based on the center point of your circle. I will refer to these coordinates as rMeas and thMeas.
Create a ""grid"" of polar coordinates. You can use the meshgrid function for this:

[rGrid,thGrid]=meshgrid(linspace(min(rMeas(:)),max(rMeas(:)),size(image,2)),linspace(min(thMeas(:)),max(thMeas(:)),size(image,1)));

Here, ""image"" is your input image, which I am assuming to be an NxM double array.

Next, you will interpolate your image onto the grid using:

newImage=griddata(rMeas,thMeas,image,rGrid,thGrid);

Just in case there are any Nan Vals, use

newImage(isnan(newImage))=0;

It does sound like a solvable problem though.",1527766920.0
FrickinLazerBeams,"Interesting problem.

My first instinct is to set up a coordinate transform that parameterizes your trajectory, so your new coordinates are only capable of describing positions along the trajectory. I suppose your position variable would actually become a scalar - distance along the trajectory. Interestingly your measurement matrix will get really wild, and maybe nonlinear. Consider, the lateral acceleration you measure will be a function not only of the second derivative of your position parameter, but of the position itself and it's first derivative! You'll have to re-derive the Kalman filter in terms of those new variables.

In the general case I imagine this could become terrifyingly ugly, maybe even intractable. 

Depending on how perfect you need your solution to be, it may be easier, and almost as good, to apply some clever manipulation to the filter state variables between the prediction and update steps of the filter. For example if you know your position must lie on a particular path, you can raise the uncertainty of the position variable proportional to the distance between the current position vector and the known trajectory. Similar logic could be applied to the velocity and acceleration variables or measurements.

In effect this would reflect your statistical prior (and remember the Kalman filter is a fundamentally statistical concept) belief that the IMU is constrained to a known trajectory. The degree to which you ""force"" the filter to follow that trajectory is a reflection of your belief that it'd constraint is perfect. Really that may be the better option, since after all it's constraint can't be perfect. If you have, for example, a cart on a rail, the actual path of the IMU will not be exactly along the rail. It will deviate around turns as the cart tilts or flexes and shifts around in its mechanical slop on the tracks.

In any event, there will not likely be a pre-packaged solution for this. At best you may find some academic literature from a group that focuses on controlling theory, robotics, autonomous navigation, etc. It's a hot field right now so it's at least worth a Google scholar search. ",1527772650.0

The numerator has:

It makes a 3D scatter plot from (x,y,z,c) coordinates where c denotes the color value for each point. However, this will plot discrete data points instead of a line. 

You could also do it yourself by looping over your data with many plot commands, manually setting the color for each line segment. For instance, suppose you have vectors x,y,z,c where 0 < c < 1. Then you could do something like 

    figure; 
    for i = 2:length(x) 
        plot3(x(i-1:i),y(i-1:i),z(i-1:i),'color',mean(c(i-1:i))*[1 1 1]);

This would set each line segment's color to be the mean of the color at the two data points it is connecting. This could be generalized for any colormap, interpolating the value of mean(c(i-1:i)) onto whatever colormap you'd like to use instead of the gray scale I used above. For instance, to do black to bright green, you could replace [1 1 1] with [0 1 0], or you could interpolate onto whatever colormap you desire. ",1527441109.0

2PetitsVerres,"I haven’t try to compile the code so I cannot pinpoint the exact problem just by inspectionbut I have two potential remarks about it.

~~\1.	You said in another comment that you initialised all your variables in C. That is incorrect because when you write~~

    double FBbym[3] = {0};

~~In Dynamics.c, you actually only initialise FBbym[0] and not element 1 and 2 of the array because using {0} don’t initialise everything’ only one element, and it’s a local variable.~~

Edit: Never mind this point 1, I made a mistake. I would still prefer to see an explicit initialization to 0 of all elements but you code is correct for that.

\2. I see that you have global variables with initialisation at definition (in hexarotor.c). Are you aware that mes files work as a dll, and is only loaded once? That mean that if you compile them and run them, the first time q will be 1 0 0 0 as defined on the top of the file, but on the second execution, the value of q will be the value of the previous simulation last step. This could be fixed with the command

    clear mex

Or by moving the initialisation of all you variables in initialiseconditions

Try this clear mex if you usually have no crash in the first execution but only on later simulations.

My last comment would be to take a look at the aerospace blockset (a toolbox) if you have access to it, as it contains block for Euler dynamics, quaternions operations, dcm and so on. And if you don’t have access to it, have you thought about implementing you algorithms using pure simulink blocks instead of C sfunction?

Here's what I'd do:

* When you plot each entity, store the handle to the plot as a member (`obj.h = plot(...)`).
* When you want to update the plot, use either `set()` or simple dot-notation to update the `XData` and `YData` of the entity's plot (`obj.h.XData = current_x; obj.h.YData = current_y`).
* Make a call to `drawnow` after everything is updated. You may find you want to slow the animation down. If so, you can use `pause` in addition to/instead of `drawnow`

For example, you might upgrade and then notice that multiplying two matrices causes MATLAB to crash (not necessarily the case, just one possible side effect).

I would say the only good reason to upgrade MKL beyond the one that ships with MATLAB is to work around an existing bug in MKL that is causing you issues with a specific problem.

If you do have the slidefun downloaded and in the same folder, I believe you may be running out of memory. Which actually seems more likely as you mentioned the code takes a long time to run. Quickly looking at slidefun, if your data vector has N elements, it will create a N x N matrix internally.

For your case, N = 11440000 would need roughly one exabyte of memory if I got that code right.

I would look into another solution such as a for loop to implement that.

If you do not set a window size, it does return a single value, as specified in the comments:

`% windowSize = window size of moving spl calculation. If no windowSize is`

`% declared, the spl of the entire input signal will be`

`% returned as a scalar. If windowSize is declared, but Fs is`

`% not declared, the units of windowSize are number of`

`% elements of the input vector. If windowSize and Fs are`

`% declared, the units of windowSize are time given by 1/Fs.`

Note that if your sampling frequency is 190667Hz, it returns the average sound level for the second around each sample, when you set a window size of 190667. I'm not sure if that is what you meant.

If you just need the instant spl in db for each sample, no moving averages, no windowing or any of the sort, just running:

`spl_db = 20*log10(y/p_ref);`

2PetitsVerres,"First of all, if you do one of these method, please leave a comment in your code for other people (and for future you, when you open the file in 6 months) to explain what the line is doing, why you do it, and how it works.

So now to the method to use: if all the values of A are integers with a value in the interval [1, length(b)], you could use indexing like this: a = b(a):

    >> a = [1 2; 3 3; 2 1];
    >> b = [4 5 6];
    >> a = b(a)
    a =
         4     5
         6     6

So this works if A contains only 1,2,3. If that's ok for you, stop here.

If A does not meet the requirement (for example if you have A(i) = 42) but you want to leave these value in the table, you have to do a little more work.
Let's say that 

    >> A = [1 2; 3 3; 42 43];

First you need to find the indexes that you want to replace

    >> idx = ismember(A, 1:length(b)); % there are several ways to do this

Now apply the previous method combined with logical indexing:

    >> A(idx) = b(A(idx))

Then you can take advantage of symmetry to turn this into a 1D problem or two 1D problems if you've got a rectangle.

If you read the [documentation on `fzero`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fzero.html) you'll see you have the option to hand in `x0` as an interval instead of as a single number. When you do it that way, MATLAB will look for solutions inside that interval only. And if you look at the optional return parameter `exitflag` you can see what `zero` does if there is no solution there. 

So, in general you can step though range [0,10] in small steps, and check between two bounds, seeing if there is a zero there. You may want to plot the function first, to look at it and see how small of steps you need to take (just eyeball where the intersections happen, and make sure your step size is closer than the distance between intersections).

shtpst,"I don't think the documentation is especially clear on this. It looks like `fminsearch` is only capable of passing *one* ""input"" to the function. You are defining two inputs, `x` and `y`, and `fminsearch` is failing because it can't handle the two inputs. 

If you instead defined your function to be:

    f = @(x)(2-x(1))^2 + 10*(x(2)-x(1)^2)^2;

Then you can say that `x` is `x(1)` and `y` is `x(2)` and handle it that way. This would mean that you would then call the function

    f( [1; 10] )

Note that the input is a single vector, not two comma-separated values. You can then also call `fminsearch` as 

    fminsearch(f, [1; 10])

FYI, you said,

> trying to use fminsearch(f, [1:10]) doesn't work

In that particular instance, it might work (because the anonymous function `f` uses `x(1)` and `x(2)`), but you might not get the results you're looking for because you used the colon `:` operator, not a semicolon. That is, you said `fminsearch(f, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])`. If `f` only uses the first two values of the input, then this is equivalent to saying `fminsearch(f, [1,2])` instead of `fminsearch(f, [1, 10])`. If there are two different local minima, you won't get the answer you're looking for. 

:EDIT:

PS - I removed the element-wise `.^` operator from the definition. If you intend to use a power `^`, just use the power. If you get an error, blindly using the `.^` operator instead is probably not the right answer. Element-wise multiplication or power or division is exactly that - every element. The ""regular"" operators do exactly the same thing when your variable is a singular value, and they do *matrix* operations when the variables are matrices.

shtpst,"> The problem is the kinetic energy of the system increases with time whereas according to our teacher it shouldn't.

(Edit: long-term, for two particles, *peak* kinetic energies should stay the same in a conserving force field)

Is there a potential field? It *looks* like it - your code has a `P1` term, but *you never use it*. What is the *total energy* in a system? Kinetic energy **plus** potential energy. The **total energy** should remain constant. 

That said, your code is really difficult to look at. I don't think it's all correct either, but I'm not going to grade the project, I'm just here to offer advice. Specifically, the crux of your question seems to revolve around the calculation of kinetic energy, yet in your code you have:

    Ek(i,p+1)=m*(Vx(i,p+1)^2+Vy(i,p+1)^2);

What's the formula for kinetic energy? Is it `m*v^2`, or is it `0.5*m*v^2`? Then there are things like: 

    dt/2/m*(Fx(i,p)+Fx(i,p+1))

Which I understand that, by order of operations, is technically correct, but man is that hard to look at. Average force, divided by mass, gives acceleration. Multiply by the time step to get velocity. Again, I understand that's what you've got, just in a different order, but writing stuff like that makes it hard to read, which in turn makes it hard to debug. 

    fAvg = (Fx(i, p) + Fx(i, p+1))/2;
    avgAccel = fAvg/m;
    Vx(i, p+1)=Vx(i, p) + avgAccel*dt;

I hope you see that the above is easier to read. There is a ton of other [code smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) throughout, but this isn't my field so I can't tell at-a-glance if it looks like you're on the right track or not, and I'm not about to try to work everything out myself. Other things that look off (""smell""):

1.  You're overwriting and then using a system variable for ""the smallest possible number"" in your calculations (`eps`)
2.  You are using absolute value functions in your force equation.
3.  If your distance gets too big you set it to zero (`sqrt(rx^2+ry^2)<Rc`) (more on this later). 
4.  You use `atan(abs(ry/rx))` instead of `atan2(ry, rx)`. 
5.  It looks like your energy equation is incorrect. Off by a factor of a constant (0.5), but incorrect is incorrect. If the basics are wrong, there's probably other mistakes. 
6.  You define an equation for potential but never use it. 
7.  You're using global variables. 
8.  You seem to be artificially constraining the distance between the particles (with the `>Lx/2` and `>Ly/2` checks)


If I had to guess, I would say that (2), (3), (4), and maybe (8) above are the primary drivers for errors here. Regarding (3), you have a check in your code:

    if r ~= 0
        F = F1(r);
    end

Try adding an `else` and warning - 

    if r ~= 0
        F = F1(r);
    else
        warning('r == 0!');
    end

You get it a lot. You seem to simultaneously use `r` as an actual value and as a flag to the rest of your code to stop calculating forces on the particles. You get the `r==0` flag a lot, which again isn't necessarily bad, but may mean something is happening in your code that shouldn't be happening. 

I also just checked your force calculation, and I don't think it's correct, either. For the record, I tried `F = diff(P, r)`. I'm not positive this is the correct way to calculate it (it's been a while since I've taken physics), but the gist is that `sigma` should remain raised to the 12th or 6th power, while `r` goes up to the 13th or 7th power, respectively. You *shouldn't* wind up with sigma\^13/r\^13, you should get sigma\^12/r\^13 You've chosen `sigma = 1`, though, which means it doesn't really matter to what power you raise it, the result is always the same. Again, like the kinetic energy formula, maybe it's not an issue, but wrong is wrong and you'll get wildly different results if someone picks *anything* other than one for `sigma`. 

I'm not saying any one thing is to blame, but as a whole it's hard to read, which makes it easy for bugs to hide. It looks like maybe you're not always doing what you intend to be doing, which is how bugs happen. 

Regarding a fix, the easiest way might be to ""cheat"" the answer. If conservation of of energy holds, then you could normalize **total** energy at each step. Total energy at the current step *must* equal the total energy at the previous step. ",1525957822.0

Onto the subject at hand.

A while loop checks if the provided condition (n <= 1:exp(1) in your case) is true or false and enters the loop only if the statement is true.

You'll likely notice that the while loop does not increment the counter variable 'n'. You'll need to increment that variable yourself inside the while loop.

Finally, I'm not sure what your condition 'n <= 1:exp(1)' means here. You stated that you wanted to continue looping until your answer is within 0.01 of exp(1). Why not just say something like 'abs(euler1 - euler) > 0.01'? Of course this doesn't work for checking if euler2 and euler3 are correct and you'll need to add more code to make it work.

kaybobnelson,"So, from the picture and your title, it looks like you want to add two different sinusoids of different frequencies and different amplitudes. You set up your `t` and `FS` in a proper way, so that should be good. Where I think you might be getting lost is your understanding of sinusoids and amplitudes and frequencies. It looks like you're establishing A1 and f1 for one sinusoid, and then A2 and f2 for a second sinusoid. You then create the first sinusoid but you're not creating the second sinusoid. You are also not adding the sinusoids together. 

It looks like you're trying to choose your amplitudes and frequencies from the plot you're trying to recreate but there seems to be some misunderstanding there too. A1 is about the same as the max value, which could make sense, but A2 is zero, which won't be a sinusoid but rather just a flat line at 0. The plot starts near 1.0525, but I don't know why you chose that as the period for f1. Your logic for f2 appears correct, as it appears you're calculating the period from two points where it plot appears to start repeating and then calculating the frequency from that. Hopefully you can make your own corrections from that feedback.

Regarding the frequency domain, have you learned about the Fourier transform? Are you expected to already know about those in your class? 

As far as what it's called when you add two signals (or two sinusoids), I am not aware of any special terms beyond just saying ""the sum of two sinusoids"". Amplitude modulation is when have a constant frequency but you change (i.e. modulate) the amplitude over time to encode information. Frequency modulation is when you change the frequency over time to encode information. That's super simplified, but I think going any deeper might not be helpful for you right now.

Without knowing more, I'm not sure what else to explain. You may benefit from watching [3blue1brown's video on the Fourier Transform](http://www.3blue1brown.com/videos/2018/1/26/but-what-is-the-fourier-transform-a-visual-introduction) to help wrap your mind around combining signals of different frequencies and how that can be represented in the frequency domain.

3\) everytime you reach a branching point \(e.g., an intersection where there is a new road you can take\) record the lowest time out of every path attempted that lead you there. The idea is to backtrack the route from where you want to end up, and to only keep track of the shortest cumulative time from that point to the destination.

5\) Go to your starting point, and everytime you reach a branching point / intersection, choose the branch that had the lowest recorded time from the backtracking computation.

jkool702,"/u/MatlabGuy's comment describes *how* to do this, but doesnt touch on *whether or not you should*.

In patricular, there are 2 things to consider:

1) Solving small systems is always faster on a (modern) CPU than on a (modern) GPU, since a) you arent coming close to utalizing the GPU's potential, and b) although the raw computation runs faster, the data transfer to/from the GPU dominates execution time. As a rough ballpark estimate, depending on the CPU and GPU you need somewhere between [200 x 200] and [1000 x 1000] (at minimum, larger is better) to make it worthwhile. Idk if your problems are actually [40 x 40] like your  example image shows. but if they are anywhere near that size youll never overcome the I/O to/from the GPU.

2) When solving the system `A * B = C` using `B = A \ C` on GPU's, A MUST be a dense (i.e., not sparse) array. If the blocked diagonal array represents `A` in this example, it might be faster on  CPU's regardless of size, since by the time you hit the size where it would normally go faster on a GPU the effect of having to fill in and compute all the `0`'s might be the more dominent factor, and this will get worse the bigger that `A` is.",1525122142.0

When you want a global variable, use a [nested function](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/nested-functions.html) instead. Tip: make sure to define every variable in the parent function that you want to be shared before you call the nested function.

since you're trying to transform a string to a string, but let's set that aside for a minute.  I've certainly tried some desperate stuff in crunch time, myself!

You want the solution to the system of differential equations.  Since your two variables are x(t) and y(t), wouldn't it make sense to solve for those instead of their derivatives?  You already have equations in the derivatives!  Those are your givens!  You seem to have followed the [documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/solve-differential-equations-using-laplace-transform.html) faithfully up to that point.  Specifically, change:

    syms dX_LT dY_LT

to:

    syms X_LT Y_LT

and amend the corresponding entries in the subsequent equations.

Furthermore, the documentation has done you a disservice by following the same process for the Laplace transform solution as with the typical ODE solution; namely they have had you define you initial conditions `cond1` and `cond2`, which you would use as parameter inputs to dsolve, but never actually employed them!  In fact, there is a place in the doc where you are supposed to define them explicitly and substitute:

> `vars = [R L C I1(0) Q(0)];`

> `values = [4 2 3 1.6 1/4 15 2];`

but I would suggest moving that step to a spot a bit earlier:

    eqns = [eqn1LT eqn2LT];
    vars = [X_LT Y_LT];
    [X_LT, Y_LT] = solve(eqns, vars)
    X_LT = subs(X_LT, [x(0), y(0)], [-2, -2])
    Y_LT = subs(Y_LT, [x(0), y(0)], [-2, -2])

If the main goal is figuring out the frequency the drops occur at, you might be able to just `fft` the data and look at it. The [fourier transform of a square wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave#Fourier_analysis) should produce a set of spikes that are at different harmonics (i.e., multiples of the square wave frequency). This should be rather noticable, and then its just a matter of finding the lowest harmonic. What you have isnt a perfect square wave of course, but it isnt too far off either.

I ran a test with some data that crudely approximates yours, and the harmonics from the square wave are fairly evident. I added a 40 sample wide hole every 100 samples on a time series with 1001 points. If you assume 1 ms sampling (so the data length is 1 second), Then the pseudo-square wave has a period of 0.1 seconds or 10 Hz, meaning that after doing `fftshift(fft(x))`, these harmonics should be at 491/511, 481/521, 471/531, etc, which is exactly what happens.

There is definitely a lot to learn, but it will become second nature after a while. You need to get comfortable searching for topics online to find the correct Matlab function to use, and then you also need to get comfortable reading the documentation to understand *how* to use those functions.

If you [search ""solve a differential equation matlab,""](https://www.google.com/search?q=solve+a+differential+equation+matlab) probably the top result is the same as it is for me - [The documentation page titled ""Solve Differential Equation""](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/solve-a-single-differential-equation.html). 

At the top of the page, there's a list of page contents. The third option is [""Nonlinear Differential Equation with Initial Condition.""](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/solve-a-single-differential-equation.html#f1-7567) 

These page contents are always *examples*. If an example sounds like something you're interested in, give it a look. For this example,

    syms y(t)
    ode = (diff(y,t)+y)^2 == 1;
    cond = y(0) == 0;
    ySol(t) = dsolve(ode,cond)

That's the code to solve a nonlinear differential equation with an initial condition. Right below that is [""Second-Order ODE with Initial Conditions""](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/solve-a-single-differential-equation.html#f1-11214), and again the code is given right there as:

    syms y(x)
    Dy = diff(y);
    
    ode = diff(y,x,2) == cos(2*x)-y;
    cond1 = y(0) == 1;
    cond2 = Dy(0) == 0;
    conds = [cond1 cond2];
    ySol(x) = dsolve(ode,conds);
    ySol = simplify(ySol)

shtpst,"It looks like you're not writing the updated figure handle back to your `hObject`. Here's what I think is happening:

1.  Your visible/invisible buttons get a valid figure handle, so they're able to make that figure visible or invisible. Changing visibility doesn't alter the figure handle, so you can do this as much as you want. 
2.  When you go to the slider, you opt to make a NEW plot, with `handles.graph1 = plot(tempd1(:,1), tempd1(:,2), 'b*');`, instead of UPDATING the plot, as in `set(handles.graph1, 'XData', tempd1(:,1), 'YData', tempd1(:,2));`. 
3.  When you make a new plot on the same axes, you make the OLD plot handle, `handles.graph1`, **invalid**. You're ""collecting"" the *new* plot handle, but then
4.  You're not *saving* the new plot handle. The `handles` struct is an **input** to `slider_Callback`. 

Matlab doesn't have pointers; when you update a value inside a function, you are updating the **local copy** of that variable/struct. In your case, when you say `handles.graph1 = ...`, you are saving the new plot handle to the **local** `handles` struct. 

The last line of the code you posted is the solution - `guidata(hObject, handles)`. 

The `handles` variable is just a big struct that you can use to save anything you want. I've used it to store minimum and maximum values, color schemes, etc. I typically mock up my GUIs on graph paper to get the layout I want, then I can get the proportions and sizes in terms of grid squares. I save those values in the handles struct. 

The handles struct, in turn, gets stored to the *figure*. This gives every child object in the figure access to the handles struct. 

So, tl;dr - 

Update the `handles` struct stored in the parent figure by putting `guidata(hObject, handles);` at the end of every callback and function. If you don't do this, any changes you make to `handles` are lost when the function finishes execution. ",1524719153.0

Assumptions.

1) You have a vector of input parameters

2) On each execution of the for-loop you increase one parameter by 5 percent and test it while holding the others constant. You also do this for decreasing the base parameter by 5 percent.

Goals.

1) You want to add and subtract 5 percent from all the parameters outside the for-loop

Logistics.

1) You cannot add or subtract 5 percent all at once because you require the other parameters to remain constant.

2) This means we need multiple iterations of the parameter vector. Specifically N-many iterations where N is the number of parameters.

3) One way we can store all those iterations is an NxN matrix constructed from rows of the param vector, look into **repmat**. We need to store this matrix 2 times (paramPlus and paramNeg)

4) There is now an easily accessible list of values that we need to change, specifically the main diagonal of our matrix, on which each parameter appears once, look into **diag**. If we can change the values on the main diagonal, then each row of our matrix will be the same except for the value in the (i,i)-th position.

5) We need to change the way you index into these arrays in the for-loop. Now i represents the row in the matrix rather than the specific element, which means that you’re going to need to convert from linear indexing to row-column indexing when you grab param values",1524644452.0

If this is the case, while I can appreciate that since the language introduced ~, it’s reasonable to want to introspect how the function was called, but there is currently no way to do that within a function.

What I was proposing was effectively just separate functions for:

Here's why - a pendulum system is a *harmonic* system. It oscillates. Your PID controller doesn't have any method for dealing with those oscillations.

jkool702,"\>  As Matlab cannot solve linear systems in parallel in the GPU

Are you sure about this? According to [The documentation on GPU supported functions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/distcomp/run-built-in-functions-on-a-gpu.html) `mldivide` is supported on gpu's \(in 2018a, though i think it has been supported few at least a few matlab versions\).

At any rate, for the matrix size your dealing with I dont think GPU's will be the best option, unless you are typically much closer to \[1000x1000\] than \[10x10\].

I [ran some tests](https://i.imgur.com/xaTmd7G.jpg) on my system \(the CPU and GPU arent comparable to what your looking at, but this can still offer some insight. In particular this is a Ivy Bridge i7 @ 3.08 GHz vs a gtx 660m. Note the CPU doesnt have AVX2 or AVX\-512, which would give a \~2x / \~3x improvement, respectively\).

I tested 5 cases: using full/sparse cases on the CPU/GPU, and using singles on the GPU. I didnt test singles on the CPU, since 1\) they usually arent that much faster in matlab, and 2\) running on a CPU youd almost certainly want to use sparse arrays, and matlab unfortunately doesnt support sparse single arrays.

* For anything less than \~80x80, I/O to/from the GPU takes up almost 100&#37; of the time. To get to where I/O is relatively small compared to compute time, you probably need to be at least \[500x500\].
* GPU's fare better if you can settle with single precision. If you need double precision then \(consumer\) gpu's are severely limited....you really need quadro/firepro cards for that, and those are pricy.
* Your problem can utilize sparsity for the tri/penta\-diagonal arrays, but on CPU's for `A \ B` bothA andB can be sparse, whereas on GPU's onlyB can be sparse. This doesnt matter much for arrays smaller than \~200x200, but quickly becomes important. For 1000x1000 arrays, you get a \~5x improvement of CPU's vs a \~2\-2.5x improvement on GPU's \(vs the analogous full CPU/GPU operation\). Unfortunately you need arrays in this size range to make GPU's viable, so this makes it a bit harder.
* My GPU wasnt showing 100&#37; utilization until \[600\-800 x 600\-800\], and it is a childs toy compared to something like a titan V. \[1000x1000\] wont saturate a titan V's compute ability, and probably wont even be close.

Granted these are very different that the CPU/GPU youd be getting, but i dont think the situation will be all that different...I just dont think the problem is big enough to really benefit from GPU's, and if you see an improvement at all itll probably be less than if you had spent more on the CPU or to add a xeon phi co\-processor or something like that.

shtpst,"Well, you haven't posted the code that generates the problem, so everyone here gets to guess what the problem could be.

My guess is that, at some point, your script terminates somehow without closing the file or before the file gets closed, OR you try to re-open the same file before the first process finishes closing it. Does it happen when you only have a little bit of data to write?

If you weren't using `xlswrite`, then I'd say you're missing an `fclose(fileID)` somewhere, but since you are, you might not be waiting long enough between writing it and opening it to read again. Matlab glitches because it tried to access the file too quickly and then it crashes before it can internally close the file. 

The next time this happens, and you can't open the file with Excel because it's being used by ""another program,"" try going to the Matlab prompt and closing all the files that Matlab has opened with:

    fclose all

If that fixes your problem, you might want to put a small pause after you write the file. Even a half second pause is going to add a ton of time to your 2000 files, though. Maybe you're opening the same file and appending data? If that's the case then you might be able to get by with comparing the last opened filename and the current filename and only pause if they're equal. 

This is my best guess as to what's wrong, but again, you need to post some code snippet that can reproduce the problem if you want an exact answer. ",1524222149.0

Optrode,"I do chronic rat ephys, both LFP and single unit.

So, the traces in these graphs are the amplitude?  As in the result of applying `abs` to the output of `hilbert`?

One thing I am noticing is that there are oscillations in the 'beta amplitude' that look suspiciously close to beta frequency themselves.  I suspect that you might be seeing an effect that occurs with signals with characteristics that are imperfectly matched by the filter's frequency response, such that the amplitude of the filtered signal varies with the signal's phase.  I would recommend checking to see if the amplitude of the beta signal systematically varies with the phase of the signal.  For example, you could try the following:

`polarscatter(angle(beta), abs(beta));`

Where 'beta' is the filtered and Hilbert transformed signal.  If you see that the amplitude is systematically varying with phase (producing an ovoid pattern in the `polarscatter`), then you should regard those periods of  ""bursting"" activity as artifacts of the filtering process...  Probably something you would want to know about before progressing any further.

Providing that you find that this is not what's happening, I would suggest that you could take advantage of the fact that the variations in amplitude that you're trying to measure are themselves close to sinusoidal, by a similar method:  Filter the amplitude of the beta signal (using a filter of relatively high bandwidth, i.e. one with low frequency resolution and high temporal resolution) and then obtain the amplitude of the oscillations in beta power.  Then choose a cutoff so that when the amplitude of the oscillations of beta amplitude (amplitude of the amplitude oscillations...) surpass that threshold, you say that a ""burst"" is occurring.",1524063709.0

In general, you can always use the vector operations of & and |, although it's worth noting that the scalar operators can be faster, since they will shortcut your boolean operations.

    function y = func(t)
    y = t.^2/2;

That's it. Just save it as `func.m`, so Matlab can find it, then you can do `func(0)`, `func(1)`, etc. This is tedious to do for little one-off functions, though, which is why the ""anonymous function"" gets a lot of use. You could also do:

    func = @(t) t.^2/2;

Now, *until you `clear` Matlab*, you're also free to do `func(0)`, `func(1)`, etc.

urides,"I haven't worked with RK4 in a while but maybe I can steer you in the right direction. A couple of things first, though:  

1.) When you say you need to use matrices for dx/dt, etc. does that mean *each one* needs its own matrix or can you put all three in one vector/matrix? Think on this.  

2.) Do you *need* to specify 12 different increments (e.g. k1,l1,m1,k2,etc.) or can you create a vector of k1, k2, k3, and k4 so that each is a vector of 3 spatial terms? Same point as with above. 

3.) Label your initial values differently than their subsequent vectors. e.g. x0=0.0001; , etc. rather than x=0.0001;. This will help you avoid confusion and avoid problems. For example, you set t(1) = 0 initially (a 1X1 double scalar) but then you create the vector t = 0:h:1500; which is a vector whose value for t(1) is 0 *regardless of what you initially write for* t(1). Setting t0 = 0.0; and then t = t0:h:1500; means you'll actually be able to change the initial value of t.  

4.) For points 1.) and 2.) I ask because vectoring your derivatives and increments will allow you to think about the problem in its 1D analog.   
  
So think about the steps to a possible main program that uses RK4:  

**Main** script:  

1.) You initialize some parameters (a, b, h, etc.) and variables (x, y, etc.)

2.) You call on the RK4 function to give you values for the variables x, y, and z given specific inputs. (Hint: Is the RK4 typically supposed to generate *all* of the values for each variable for all times? Would it be easier/clearer to generate a value for each variable given a specific time?)  
  
3.) You use the output of the RK4 to collect your values of each variable in a vector/matrix.  

4.) You plot your spatial values, if necessary.  

Given these steps you need to think hard on what you *actually* need the RK4 to do for you. e.g. Should the RK4 be the thing to loop through all the time steps? (Why do you need the ""main"" program if this is the case?); What does the RK4 function actually need as an input?; Should this process (whatever it may be) be handled by the RK4 or should the main program do this?; etc. 

**RK4** function:  

1.) Take in necessary inputs  

2.) Compute a new value for each increment (e.g. k1, k2, etc.) given the inputs  

3.) Use these increments to obtain a new value for each variable (x(i+1),y(i+1), etc.)

4.) Output the new values to the main program.  

It might require a lot of rewriting but thinking about your code in this way will help make the steps necessary for each part clearer.  
  
To specifically address your question about the anonymous functions dxdt=@(t,x,y,z)..., etc., think about where the derivatives are required and more importantly, what is required to do with them. In other words, the RK4 needs the derivatives to tell it how to compute each increment (k1, etc.), right? Do the derivatives themselves change or simply the value of them with each step? It's a silly question, but the anonymous function (the @function) simply answers it in the latter by keeping the function the same while you change the variable inputs to get a new output. If you didn't want to use the @functions what would need to happen to ensure that you keep the each derivative the same but obtained different values for the derivative's output? Where would you store these values? Think about your code right now? Do you need to use the derivatives dx/dt, etc. for each increment step, or do you need the *value* of the derivative at each step?  
  
Could you generate the *values* of these derivatives, store them somewhere, and *then* use them for the RK4 steps? Answering this is the key to what you're looking for, I think. Good luck!",1523931859.0

It's not bad to use Matlab on an Apple computer. I would instead ask why do you want an Apple computer? The hardware isn't necessarily anything special, and it's got quite a price premium attached to it. 

I don't know if you are intending to buy used, new, or refurbished. But I would recommend going with a used or refurbished laptop. I use a Lenovo Thinkpad T440. I bought it in June of 2016. It's still my daily driver laptop. The biggest thing for me about this laptop is that it has pretty good specs (i5-4300, 8Gb Ram) and I use matlab on it regularly. More importantly, its price point is something that isn't going to hurt me a lot financially in the event it gets stolen and I need to replace it. (It was <$400)

- if you depend on a toolbox that only works on one platform due to a dependency like hardware drivers that only exist on certain platforms. This can show up with certain instruments and sensors.

On Windows and Linux if you need truly heavy duty hardware with lots of memory, disk, or processors there are vendors who can provide it (with a huge P.O. attached, of course). With Apple you have one vendor and that's it.

shtpst,"I think the command you're looking for is `vpa`. Try `disp(vpa(answer, 2))`. 

The comma and number there tells Matlab how many significant digits you want to see. 

:EDIT:

I'll add too that, generally speaking, Matlab doesn't ""know"" if your symbolic variables are going to be real or complex, so if you try using the `real(<your symbolic expression>)` or `imag(<your symbolic expression>)`, you just get the same symbolic expression out, wrapped in `real` or `imag`, respectively. 

You *could* do something like `assume` things about your terms, but honestly I've always found that to be a real pain in the ass and usually not worth the effort. You're really going to have an easier time with it if you manually rewrote your expressions as a real term and an imaginary term. Then you could do something like

    Z1_real = <stuff>
    Z1_imag = <more stuff>
    <same for Z2>
    solve(Z1_imag + Z2_imag == 0, x)

I'll point out too that you should probably use something more descriptive for a frequency variable. If you say `x` is frequency, okay... I guess that works. It's a pain to remember, though, because I've never seen a source that uses `x` as a symbol for frequency. What are your units, btw? You could use `w` or `omega` for a frequency in rad/s or `f` or `freq` for frequency in Hz. Remember, `w = 2*pi*f`, so expect to be off by a factor of ~36 if you use the wrong term.

SSJ3,"Looks like you're on the right track, and that code is likely going to stay almost the same for your problem here. Assuming your formulae are correct, after the end of the loop it would be very straightforward to plot the temperatures over time, and I see it already has a plot statement.

I find it curious that you're directly calculating the values at select points... are you certain you're not supposed to calculate at every point (all 150 nodes), and then extract the 9 points from the full solution? That would be more typical for a problem like this.

For that, I would recommend thinking about how to structure the formula so you can loop over the points and apply the same formula to each, rather than writing a hardcoded formula derived one at a time. Remember, with programming, most of the time if you find yourself copying and pasting nearly the same code, you can combine it into a loop.

Secondly, you could quickly run into a storage problem if you try to keep the entire time history in memory. Think about having one 150-node array representing the solution at j, and a second representing j+1, then at the end of the iteration put the j+1 solution into the j array and grab the 9 points you need and put them in their own array for analysis later.

I would not mind handing you a bunch of code for this, as I think I get the equations you're deriving, but I'd like to help empower you to figure it out on your own. Just let me know how far you get and if there's anything you struggle with!",1523793390.0

Regardless, you should avoid the use of `eval` for a variety of reasons, particularly if you plan to accept raw user input (e.g., from an inputdlg or text field), as the user could execute arbitrary commands (not just the ones you would expect from a calculator). 

You can work around this by using `str2double` to convert numeric values. If you need to allow single button pushes (e.g., push `9`, then `6` to enter `96`), you can build up an operand string--then convert to double whenever an operator button (e.g., `*`, `/`, `=`) is pressed (and execute the appropriate operation). 

If you want to build the whole operation as a single string (e.g., to enable the user to enter ""1+2*4+7"", see the whole string of operands and potentially edit them), you can do that too--build it as a single string like you've been doing, but use `regexp` to split into operands and operators, use `str2double` on the operands and interpret the operators (e.g., use an Nx2 cell array of `{'+', @add; '-', @subtract; ...}` and use the operator string to find the appropriate function handle).

The `dat(i1)` part is probably the problem.

The way you use `dat.a` is actually shorthand for `dat(:).a`, which grabs `a` from each of the individual structures making up the struct array and combines them. BUT, these are scattered throughout the memory space, so it takes a while to find them all (relative to if they were sequential).

Let's take a sphere that grows over time - this is a four dimensional function. x,y,z,t. If you took 2D slices of the x,y,z data, then you'd get a ""slice"" of the sphere - a cross section. 

If you plot the cross section at t=0, when the sphere radius is zero, then you get a point. As you continue to take slices, you wind up *filling* a figure, because you're drawing concentric circles, from r = 0 to r = rMax, at times t=0 to t=tMax.

box_o_foxes,"Mathworks has tons of documentation on their built in functions (such as 'plot'). Use it to your advantage! The reason your script isn't working is because it's the wrong kind of input. It's actually looking for specific points. 

Here's one way to approach the problem (although probably not the most elegant way, it's pretty simple/intuitive). 

Start by creating  your matrix of k values:

`k = [1:0.01:5];` 

Now you have ""saved"" values at these steps. Next is to run through iterations of each k-value. 

`for i = 1:length(k)`

Now add your if/elseif criteria here, but place ""(i)"" after all your ks and xs. Now, as your script iterates through each entry in your k matrix, it will analyze it and create a corresponding x-coordinate. 

`end`

Now you should have two matrices (k and x) that are the same size. 

at the end of your script, you can type 

`figure;
plot(k,x, '*')`

When you run your entire script, you should see your graph. 

Alternatively, you can manually create the graph by running the script (without the figure; plot(k,x) at the end) and then type those in the command window. 

As some general housekeeping, it's usually convenient (particularly when you're starting out anyways) to put 

`clear, close all`

on line one of your script. Every time you run, it will close all open figures and delete all your saved variables from your previous runs. You're basically starting from scratch every time you run your script. 


Generally speaking, if you want a calculation to run every time you run your script, it needs to be in your script. If you just want to use it for checking things or one-time calculations, etc. it's probably fine to just use the command line. 

Edit: Yes Matlab Gurus, I know relying on clear, close all isn't *best* practice. But I (and several others I know) found it useful when just starting out learning because it was one less thing to worry about in scripts. People who are just learning the basics don't generally need variables saved in their workspace, nor are they typically sharing their scripts with others. In any case, it's the coder's prerogative to blindly use commands suggested by a stranger on the internet - and to reap the consequences of not knowing what they do.",1523483275.0

Beard_Space,"Welcome to Matlab!

When you use Matlab there are essentially two types of .m files: functions and scripts. The .m file you have downloaded is a function - you can tell from the function declaration in the first code line of the .m file. Matlab functions can be called (used) by other Matlab functions, Matlab scripts or from Matlabs  Command Window (the bottom window in your case). So the way you should use the .m file you have, is to place it in Matlabs path (for ease of use, you can put it in /documents/MATLAB since Matlab will check this folder on startup of the program. When you have done this, restart matlab.) Now you can use the function by creating a new script (empty .m file) and pasting something like this:

    % Script to call dicom2raw.m
    clear all;   % clear variables
    close all;   % close figures
    clc;         % clear command window

shtpst,"Wow that code is painful to look at. Your ""picture of what you're simulating"" is pretty useless without a key or legend or explanation, etc.

There are a few huge issues with your code and a lot of little pointers I can give out, so we'll start with the big, painful truth first and move on down the list to little trivial things last.

The headline:

 **Your code doesn't find points of a cone that intersect with a dome.** Your code finds points of a cone that **are also** points of a dome. Maybe the code you've written works for you as-is, because you *happen* to have sampled the cone and the dome on the same grid. If the points of the cone are not **exactly** equal to the points in the dome, then you will not get any results. To test this, try something like adding pi/1000 to your cone (or dome) points. I think you'll come up with zero results. The reason is because you're not looking at or calculating an *equation* of intersection between the cone(s) and dome(s), but instead just using the `intersect()` function. I understand that you want to test for intersection between two geometric figures, but Matlab's `intersect()` function tests for intersection of two *sets*, not two *shapes*. You are passing in two arrays of points, but Matlab is treating them like two lists and checking which points (or, rows in your case, using the `'rows'` specifier) are common between them. 

Now, that said, here are things you can do to clean up that code to make things easier to work with and look at. 

1.  For your plot, use `axis equal` to get the same tick spacing on each axis. It looks like you span ~0.8 on the z-axis (I'm assuming), but only ~0.6 on the x- and y-axes. Matlab **will** distort your plot to try to fill each axis *unless* you tell it not to. Make your plot, then call `axis equal` to get the view uniform. 
2.  You keep calling `if isempty(cone1)==0`. The function `isempty()` returns TRUE or FALSE. You are saying ""if TRUE==FALSE"" or ""if FALSE==FALSE"". You don't need the `==0` or `==1`. If you want to see if the `cone1` is empty, just use `if isempty(cone1)`. If you want to see if it is NOT empty, just use the NOT `~` operator, as in `if ~isempty(cone1)`. If you want to check multiple conditions, just do something like `if (isempty(cone1)) && (~isempty(cone2))`, etc. 
3.  If your intention IS just to get the points in the cones that are equal to the points in the domes, then just append them all together and run one big `intersect()` test. You could do that like:

    cones = [];
    for currentCone = 1:numel(Cone1_cell)
        if ~isempty(Cone1_cell{currentCone})
            cones = [cones; Cone1_cell{currentCone}];
        end
    end

The above snippet looks at how many entries are in your cell array `Cone1_cell`, and then, for each entry in that cell, checks if that entry is empty. If it is not empty, then it *appends* the contents of the cell to a `cones` matrix. The result will be one long matrix that contains all entries for all cones. 

You do that, and then the same thing for the domes (CupBig and CupSmall?) and then you can do one call:

    matchingPoints = intersect(cones, cups);
    CovFind_Outputs = size(matchingPoints, 1);

I should add that I'm assuming that your points are in an Nx3 matrix, where `N` is the number of points. If you have that tranposed (3xN), then you would need to append to cone by using a comma instead of a semicolon, and check the number of matches by checking the number of columns `size(matchingPoints, 2);` instead of the number of rows `size(matchingPoints, 1);`. 

If you decide you want to do a more sophisticated form of intersection testing, then I would suggest you loop. Right now you *say* you have ""a ridiculously high number of loops,"" but you don't. You have a ridiculously high number of *elseif* statements. You could recreate almost your *entire function* as follows:

    cups{1} = CupBig_coordinates;
    cups{2} = CupSmall_coordinates;
    matchingPoints = [];
    for currentCup = 1:numel(cups)
        testCup = cups{currentCup};
        if ~isempty(testCup)
            for currentCone = 1:numel(Cone1_cell)
                testCone = Cone1_cell{currentCone);
                    if ~isempty(testCone)
                        newPoints = intersect(testCone, testCup, 'rows')
                        % OR do a more sophisticated intersection test here!
                        matchingPoints = [matchingPoints; intersect(testCone, testCup, 'rows')];
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
    
    matchingPoints = unique(matchingPoints, 'rows');

The code above, in plain English, says:

1.  Stash all cups in a cups array, then
2.  Get a cup from the cups array, then
3.  If there is a cup, get a cone from the cones array, then
4.  If there is a cone, do the intersection test (Or do a more sophisticated intersection test here!), then
5.  Get the next cone.
6.  If there aren't any more cones, reset the cones and get the next cup.
7.  If there aren't any more cups, you're done. 
8.  Get the unique intersections (don't double-count any points). 

The no-double-count bit at the end is what you're doing with your `union` calls at the end(s) of your function. Personally, I would think you would want to keep the double counted points, because of *why* they're getting double counted - they are repeat intersections between different cones and/or different domes. 

You're having this problem because, again, you appear to have sampled both shapes on the same grid/spacing, so you have multiple exact overlaps. 

You seem to pack a bunch of data into your outputs, but you only stated in your question that you're trying to find out *how many* points ""intersect."" 

------------------------------

Now, having written all of that, I went back and re-read your question. You said,

> I've written a function that selects 1-5 cones and finds out how many points of the cone arrays intersect with the domes. I'm essentially trying to find the combination with maximum intersects. 

You say you're trying to find the ""combination with maximum intersects,"" but the answer should always be the same - use all the cones and all the cups. That will always give you the most number of intersections because those are the most number of points. 

Maybe you *meant* to say (or do) the most number of points that is common to **all** of the cones and cups you use, but *that's not what you're doing.* Consider line `148` in your pastebin file:

You get `Pts1_CupBig`, `Pts2_CupBig`, Pts3..., and then all of them for `CupSmall`. These are all done with `intersect`, which means you're trying to find the points that exist in BOTH `ConeN` AND `CupBig` (or `CupSmall`). BUT, when you're done with that, line 154 shows you doing a UNION with `Pts1_...`, `Pts2_..`, `Pts3_...`. 

You find the matching points between Cone1, Cone2, Cone3, and the Big/Small Cups, but then you just count all of them. You could rewrite lines 148, 149, 150, and 154 as:

    Covered_Pts_CupBig = intersect([Cone1; Cone2; Cone3], CupBig_coordinates, 'rows');

Again, assuming ConeN is an Nx3 matrix (otherwise it'd be `[Cone1, Cone2, Cone3]`). 

You'll need to think hard about what you're actually trying to do, and then, if you still need help, come back and articulate what it is that you're trying to accomplish. I might be wrong, but I don't think the code is doing what you want it to do. ",1523355271.0

That being said, you can use matlab for all sorts of signal processing.  You can also do it in other languages, but for coding VSTS / RTAS plugins, C languages are the choice.  The reason is that matlab files require matlab to run, or at least the code writing software (expensive) to output it as a C style class or function.  If you go direct with C++ / C# then you have one less translation step and the accompanying boondoggles.

These questions, however, may have been written back when MATLAB didn't have this functionality.  All letters on a computer are actually [stored internally as numbers](https://www.asciitable.com/), and MATLAB lets you access characters by their numbers.  Any number over 128 will be a character with special signs or accents, you can switch between lowercase and uppercase by shifting the numbers by 32, and spaces have their own number.  At least this is all usually true, unless you configured your computer in some unusual way.  You can also use normal matrix approaches, like equality testing and logical indexing, on character arrays.  So they may have expected you to use these lower-level techniques rather than using the newer, built-in functions.

For your case, you can do

    lower(regexprep({firstname,lastname},['[^0-9_a-zA-Z]'],['']))

Basically, the `'[^0-9_a-zA-Z]'` looks for any character that isnt a upper/lower case letter or a number or a `_`  and replaces it with `''` (i.e., with nothing). The `\W` can also be used to match these. Then the `lower(...)` makes everything lower case. When things are input is a cell array the same operation is independently applied to each cell in the cell array.

Edit: This assumes you dont want things like `!@#$%^&*(){}[]\|;:'"",.<>/?+=-` included. If you did you could instead use `'[^0-9a-zA-Z!@#$%^&*(){}[]\|;:''"",.<>/?+=-_]'`",1522776657.0

shtpst,"I'm not sure *quite* what exactly your data looks like - I'm assuming the first column of `num` is the test name, like `TM_12`, etc.? Is this a cell array or a character array or a string array? Kind of similar things, but they *are* different, so it'll make a difference how you do the following. 

That said, consider the following:

    testData{1,1} = 'TM_12';
    testData{2,1} = 'TM_12';
    testData{3,1} = 'TM_12';
    testData{4,1} = 'TM_12';
    testData{5,1} = 'TM_05';
    testData{6,1} = 'TM_05';
    testData{7,1} = 'SL_23';
    testData{8,1} = 'SL_23';
    testData{9,1} = 'SL_23';

    uniqueTests = unique(testData);
    nTests = numel(uniqueTests);

    for currentTest = 1:nTests
        fprintf('Current test is %s, and \n', uniqueTests{currentTest});
        validSamples = find(ismember(testData, uniqueTests{currentTest}));
        nSamples = numel(validSamples);
        fprintf('there are %d samples found for this test.\n', nSamples);
    end

Notice that the output order is (probably) not the same as the input order - `unique` will `sort` the output by default. If you don't want to do this, you can `setOrder` to `stable` by calling: `uniqueTests = unique(testData, 'stable');`. You can `doc unique` to read more about it. 

Once you have the unique test names, just find the bits that match in your sample set with the `find(ismember(pool, candidate))` call. Once you have those indices, you can loop through the individual tests:

    for currentSample = validSamples
        <do your thing>
    end

Notice there that it's `= validSamples` instead of `= 1:validSamples` because `validSamples` *already has all of the indices you need.* I think a lot of people maybe don't realize that, when you make a `for` loop in Matlab, you are defining a new vector for Matlab to iterate through. 

The nice thing about this is that the samples don't have to be next to each other - this will find all entries with the same name in the entire data set. This might be bad for you. There are ways of dealing with it if there are, but it's up to you to decide what's acceptable. 

You say that you are intending for your code to make ""a new matrix"" for each test entry, but let me tell you why that's bad - you're going to have to reference each one by its own name. I would (personally) rather have all the results in a results matrix and look at everything that way.

If you're wanting to have one set of results (temp/pressure, or more, etc.) for each entry in your original data set, then why not just append two columns (or however many items you're going to keep as results) onto the original table and stash your entries there?

Anyways, hopefully this gives you a good start. If you want something more specific, you'll need to post some actual data and also provide either a sample output or a detailed description of what you're going to do with the data.

But again, I would steer clear of using programmatically generated names for data storage. It's a pain to make, it's easy to screw up, it's a pain to use - it's just bad all around. If you really wanted, keep the `uniqueTests` and add a second column to it - you can stash **anything** in a cell in a cell array, including an entire other cell array, or a matrix, or anything. 

Then you could have something like `uniqueTests{1,1}` give you `TM_12`, and then `uniqueTests{1,2}` could give you *all the test data* for that test entry. Then `uniqueTests{1,3}` could give you *all the results* for those tests. Or `{1,2}` could be a partitioned matrix that gives you test data and results, `{1,4}` could give you test statistics, `{1,5}` could list outliers if any, etc. 

All things to consider. I don't know anything about you or your data or your intended use, so I'm just throwing ideas out. Hope this help :) ",1522781538.0
123abc-123xyz,"Unless a large matrix has a well-defined formula for what each element should be, I am usually using pencil and paper to fully understand what the structure of the matrix should be and the best ways to construct it. It largely depends on the context.

For example, in a simulation of interacting particles I worked on a couple years ago, each element of a matrix corresponded to some comparison between two particles. As such, I simply iterated through all `i`, `j`, to build the matrix element-wise. On the other hand, in a finite-element simulation, it made more sense to build the stiffness matrix by iterating through the nodes in my geometry and adding each component to the matrix separately.

Unless your system is prohibitively large or complex, I fully recommend a complete description of the matrix system symbolically on paper. Even for large systems, working with just a subset of the matrix on pen and paper to make sure you understand what's going on is important.

jkool702,"Let me suggest a 3rd option that might work well.

In my experience, Matlab deals with parallelization very poorly unless calling a built-in or external library that in natively parallelized. I imagine that the situation with nested timers is similiar in terms of having poor performance when another function is running in the foreground.

In the past, Ive gotten around this by launching multiple instances of matlab (each of which was bound to a non-overlapping subset of my physical cpu cores) and syncronizing them up somehow. If you could give the timing functions their own matlab instance (or perhaps multiple matlab instances) I imagine this would significantly reduce the jitter. 

The trick is then to share the data between instances simultaniously, and the best (perhaps only) good way to do this is probably using shared memory. [sharedmatrix](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28572-sharedmatrix?s_tid=gn_loc_drop) is a function ive been meaning to try out but havent had time, but it sets up a shared memory segment between multiple instances, allowing for effectively instant transfer betweenmultiple instances. Unfortunately that function was built for a much older matlab version, but seems to at least partially still be working. If nothing else though it shows that setting up shared memory is possible.

Assuming you can get the shared memory up and running, the entire process can be automated by launching additional matlab instances from within 1 ""main"" instance using the `system` command and including a flag that tells it to execute a pre-setup script.

Id guess that having the timers running in their own instance and writing the times to a shared memory segment would significantly reduce the timing jitter you are seeing. Getting it set up might be a bit of work though...

If you do decide to give this a try and are successful please let me know....At some point when I have free time Im planning on tackling this problem since I have a whole bunch of use cases where this would come in handy (e.g., any single-threaded function that you have no choice but to use, something like `fread`, can be run in a dedicated single-threaded instance and then write its results to a shared memory segment, which you can begin to work with using the resources that single-threaded process wont use).",1522429405.0

Comael321,"Each UI element on the screen has a callback property that is by default empty. The idea is in order to add interactivity to your app, you need to tell MATLAB what to do when E.g. a button gets clicked, or a text box has something typed in it (maybe you want the user to be able to type in an ID number and have the rest of the screen pull data for that ID number, or maybe you want to make a calculator and have an ""="" button that runs the calculation the user has entered and return the answer to the screen).

 In order to do that, you need to write a callback function. Callback functions are a little special in that they have 2 mandatory inputs you need to account for, otherwise you'll get errors about the number of input arguments. These two inputs (in the order they're passed to the function) are:

Source: this is a copy of the handle to the object the callback is attached to. So if you attach the callback to a text box, the source argument will be the handle to the text box. This lets you query all the information about the object that was interacted with, but most commonly you'll want to use it to get the value of the object that was interacted with (eg when the user enters text into a textbox and the callback fires, you can use this source argument to get the text the user entered)

Event: this is a structure containing information about the event that caused the callback to fire. It will tell you things like if a button was left or right clicked, or if a certain key combination was pressed. This can be used to add deeper interactivity to your apps.

So you write a callback function at the end of your script as you would any other function, accounting for the source and event inputs (even if it's just replacing them with ~ eg function MyCallBack(~,~)), then set the callback property of the desired object to the handle of the function you've just written (eg set(MyButton, 'Callback', @MyCallBack); or alternatively set it directly when you initially declare MyButton)

Lastly, if you want your callback to have other input arguments than source and event, you need to set the callback property of the desired object to a cell array, the first element of which contains the handle to the callback function, and each subsequent element is an argument that will be passed to your function after the source and event arguments. Eg set(MyButton, 'Callback', {@MyCallBack, ExtraArg1, ExtraArg2}); where MyCallBack then accepts the arguments as: function MyCallBack(source, event, ExtraArg1, ExtraArg2)

EDIT:

PS a handy way to get more understanding and to troubleshoot any issues is to get comfortable with the debug features that let you look at function workspaces, so you can take a poke around inside the source and event objects to get a feel for what they are. You can also make (careful!!) use of assignin() inside your callback to pass the arguments the function receives back to your base workspace if you're trying to debug behavior ",1522438227.0

FrickinLazerBeams,"Solidworks sldprt files are a proprietary format. I doubt the solidworks vendor would release the format specification to you or anybody else. At least not without an NDA and a few million dollars. It is probably also (intentionally) difficult to reverse engineer.

The only practical way to get model data into another program is to export your model from solidworks in a commonly readable format, like STEP, STL, or maybe IGES. Then you'd need to find a Matlab tool to read those formats. I know that one exists at least for STL, and I would expect others to be out there somewhere. If you want explicit dimensions to be retained, you'd probably want to use STEP. I don't know much about IGES files. ",1522427863.0

FrickinLazerBeams,"What you're trying to do is generally called optimization, or fitting. Fminsearch, fmincon, and fminunc are all examples of optimization tools.

Fminsearch is generally the easiest to use, and the most likely to work well without having to fiddle with optimizer settings. The others can be made more efficient or more accurate if you do some work. Fmincon specifically will solve *bounded* optimization problems, where you need to find the parameters `p` that minimize a function `f(p)`, subject to some constraints on the values `p` is allowed to have.

In general, to use an optimizer, you write a function that accepts as input a vector containing the parameters you're going to be finding (generally called the fit parameters) - in your case, `t`. This function, generally called your ""error function"" uses that parameter to calculate some figure of merit (generally called the ""error"") that should be zero when the value of `t` is the true value and increases as `t` differs from the true value. A common way of defining the error is to take your model output and your data, and compute the sum of the squares of their difference, called the Sum Square Error (SSE). It's also common to use the Root Mean Square (RMS), Root Sum of Squares (RSS), or just the Mean of Squared Errors (MSE). 

You pass your error function to the optimizer as a function handle, along with an initial guess for the parameter values, and the optimizer will run your function with various values of the fit parameters until it finds the value which minimizes the error. It doesn't know anything about what's inside your function or how you are computing the error. All it does is take your function and run it with different parameter values. Different optimization algorithms use different strategies to select the next parameter value to try based on the error obtained from previous values. In general you can think of estimating the slope of the error function from calculating `f(p)` and `f(p + dp)` and using that to select another value for `p` that should be ""downhill"" of the previous value. 

The proper use of these functions is well documented, and you should read that documentation. Also read about function handles.

You should also understand that the optimizer will call your error function repeatedly - potentially thousands of times, depending on how quickly it converges to a solution. So if your function takes a long time to run, optimization can take a very long time. You should also understand that you may find different minima depending on your starting guess, especially if your error function has more than one local minimum. It's important to make a reasonable starting guess. ",1522320000.0

shtpst,"You haven't given any of the exact code (your definition of `g` you provided here wouldn't run at all because you're missing a parenthesis), so it's hard to comment on exactly what the problem would be. 

That said, if `f(x, y, z)` is not symbolic, then you can't take a symbolic derivative of it. Further, when you're calling `diff()`, you're not telling Matlab what variable to use when finding the derivative. A partial derivative is a partial derivative *with respect to one variable.*

So, if you have `f(x, y, z)`, then you can have `∂f/∂x`, or `∂f/∂y`, or `∂f/∂z`, but you don't get to have `∂f/(∂xyz)` or something like that. 

If you're looking for [Del, the vector differential operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del), you can make that with all of the partial derivatives.

So again, to be clear, if you have `f` defined as a *symbolic* expression, then you can take the *symbolic* partial derivative by:

    g = diff(f, <var you want to use for the partial>);

The ""1"" for the first derivative is implied. You can't pass values to `g` for the same reason you can't pass values to `f` - it's symbolic. It's not a ""real"" expression. If you want to pass variables, try `subs()`, as in:

    g = @(xIn, yIn, zIn)subs(diff(f, <var to use>), [x, y, z], [xIn, yIn, zIn]);

This takes the symbolic partial derivative of `f`, *with respect to the variable of your choice*, then plugs in your inputs into the result.

**Symbolic math is slow.** You're better off, if at all possible, to pre-compute the expression for `g` and then just use that. ",1522250819.0

Regardless, I think my approach would be to spawn a shell that manages everything. Have Matlab spawn a shell with inputs. The shell then starts `programm.exe` and forwards the inputs it received. 

The shell starts the process and then starts essentially a [watchdog timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer). If <watchdog timer> seconds have elapsed but the process hasn't exited, then the shell kills the process and exits itself. If the process did exit, then the shell exits.

Now Matlab can spawn as many shells as it wants. Each shell is only responsible for one process and Matlab doesn't need to track anything. Except maybe you might want to track how many shells are open and wait until it's below some limit before you spawn a new process, just to stop Matlab from flooding your computer.

Is your program bugged? I looked briefly at it, and I noticed that you clear the persistent variables... then never redefine them. I would imagine then that nothing else from that call is retained. You might be able to get by with something like,

    <logic that gets you to clearing the variables>
    clear <your persistent variables>
    myLoopTimer(varargin)
    return;

This just clears the persistent variables then retries the `myLoopTimer` function with the same inputs that were originally passed. I'm not running this on my box right now, so you might need `myLoopTimer(varargin{:})` instead, but hopefully you see my point. Then the original instance just returns after the child instance completes. 

Also, you set the persistent variables to empty `= []`, which is redundant if you're going to clear them. 

In your ""recommended syntax,"" you have a comment that says you can use `'iname=<...>')`; should that be `'-iname=<...>')` instead? With a minus in front?

The timer function gets called every time the loop iterates, and there is a bunch of cell and string/char operations on every call. How much time does the loop timer itself take to run?",1522241886.0

jkool702,"IMO, the answer key is right but for the wrong reason.

Im assuming the question is talking about floating point precision. Whether or not a floating point operation causes precision loss depends on whether or not the dynamic range of the output result is smaller than the dynamic range of both inputs. 

For subtraction, this equates to: As long as the output is smaller then both inputs (e.g., `300.xxxxx - 299.xxxxx`) then the outut doesnt lose precision. Something like `300.xxxxx - 1.xxxxx` would lose precision, since the output (`299.xxxxx` or so) wont have enough bits to represent the least significant digits in the `1.xxxxx` input.

Method 1 produces a bunch of subtractions with no precision loss, and then adds them (this last operation could lose precision if it produces a value larger than the original inputs, but this is unavoidable).

Method 2 produces a larger number `sum(y(i).^2)` that does lose quite a bit of precision compared to each individual `y(i)`and then subtracts `n*y^2`, which also has less precision than `y` (this is easy to imagine for `abs(y) > 1` and `abs(y(i)) > 1`, though looking at the dynamic range of the inputs vs outputs im 99% sure method 2 still loses more precision even if `y` and `y(i)` have magnitudes less than 1).

> I was under the impression that subtractive error isn't important when you just subtract once, but when you're subtracting n times (n being possible hundreds or thousands of times) the error can add up and be accumulated.

This is (probably) true, but the same applies to the `sum(y(i).^2)` term, so this ends up not really mattering. 

Edit: also note that this isnt true (in the limit of time-->infinity) if you assume floating point errors are normally distributed, since adding a bunch of normally distributed errors produces statistically speaking does not change the mean or standard deviation of the expected error. In practice errors probably arent strictly normal and probably do have a tendency to increase with more operations, but the increase is slow since not every error increases the ""final error vs an error free computation"" simply because a given error might help correct for the effect of a previous error rather than make it worse.",1522209727.0

angrmgmt00,"Extend the method you have already used:  [concatenation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/strcat.html#btwmmkd-5).  You can concatenate the string on iterations after the first using a conditional statement to check 'i', OR (and this is my preference) you can simply create 'text1' as an empty matrix, and begin concatenation in the first iteration.

Example:

    x = [];
    for idx = 1:10
        num = idx*10;
        x = [x, num];
    end
    disp(x)

This works for strings as well, and in the [uicontrol 'String' property](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.ui.control.uicontrol-properties.html#bt6ck7c-1-String), concatenation is the method by which you create multiline text.

If you need to use cell arrays instead (depends on your UI, which is invisible to us), you can concatenate by just [indexing into a new spot](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/add-cells-to-a-cell-array.html):

    cellGuy = {'thing1', 'thing2'};
    cellGuy{3} = 'thing3';

If so, then do you mean the distance across the overlap in either of the two cardinal direction pairs (N-S, E-W)?

Knowing that, there are 3 possibilites:
The signal can be poorly sampled (if you are not following the nyquist rates) and lose a lot of its original harmonics.
The signal can be critically sampled, just to close to the nyquist rate, that way you have few losses.
And finally the signal can be super sampled, that is, you put the sampling time above the nyquist time and you have the signal sampled perfectly.
There' no right or wrong sampling time, it just needs to fit your necessities, but its always recommended to work above nyquist rates and time.

> • Functions that accept a matrix and return a scalar or constant-size vector always produce output in full storage format. For example, the size function always returns a full vector, whether its input is full or sparse.

> • Functions that accept scalars or vectors and return matrices, such as zeros, ones, rand, and eye, always return full results. This is necessary to avoid introducing sparsity unexpectedly. The sparse analog of zeros(m,n) is simply sparse(m,n). The sparse analogs of rand and eye are sprand and speye, respectively. There is no sparse analog for the function ones.

> • Unary functions that accept a matrix and return a matrix or vector preserve the storage class of the operand. If S is a sparse matrix, then chol(S) is also a sparse matrix, and diag(S) is a sparse vector. Columnwise functions such as max and sum also return sparse vectors, even though these vectors can be entirely nonzero. Important exceptions to this rule are the sparse and full functions.

> • Binary operators yield sparse results if both operands are sparse, and full results if both are full. For mixed operands, the result is full unless the operation preserves sparsity. If S is sparse and F is full, then S+F, S*F, and F\S are full, while S.*F and S&F are sparse. In some cases, the result might be sparse even though the matrix has few zero elements.

> • Matrix concatenation using either the cat function or square brackets produces sparse results for mixed operands.

I agree with other posters that the side question is asking a bit much of matlab. Sparse matrices are not, in general, smaller or faster than full matrices. It sounds like you have a mixture of sparse-fast and full-fast operations, or that you have sparse-fast operations, and full-fast operations that you know will cancel out in the end. I imagine the truth of those things is input dependent, which is information that the matlab compiler does not have. ",1521612040.0

jkool702,"As a first note, its typically easier to just try stuff like this than to ask online about it (assuming you have access to matlab)

This should make it decently obvious when is going on.

In general, `[a b]` and `[a, b]` are the same as `cat(2,a,b)`, which concatenates `a` and `b` along the second dimension. 

Similiarly, `[a; b]`  is the same as `cat(1,a,b)`, which concatenates `a` and `b` along the first dimension.

BioBreed,"It looks like start is a function that A(u) is being passed to and the returned array is assigned to variable start.

I'm not sure but I believe the sum is returning the sum of all values less than T.

The period means ""for each"" basically. Matlab does everything as an array so when multiplying for example if you want to do each value in a matrix you need to include the period.

jkool702,"you could use `bsxfun` with a custom designed function that has the form `foo(StartEnd,pathNum)` where `StartEnd` is an array with size [# start positions --by-- # end positions] and `pathNum` is a scaler integer. Then, I think you do something like `bsxfun(foo,StartEnd,reshape([1:numPaths],1,1,[]))`. 

IF you can make this work it would give a `[m x m x n]` array, for `m` start/end points and `n` paths.You could then do a straightforward search for the shortest path. 

Though tbh, using a loop is probably easier and just as fast. The one exceptiion is if you can get the path distance using builtin operations with bsxfun (e.g., `bsxfun(@times,...,...)` or `bsxfun(@minus,...,...)`) - these will be faster. Unfortunately, using bsxfun with a custom function (`foo` in the above text) makes it much slower.",1521572455.0

jkool702,"Dealing with compilation issues without using computer science concepts and when given somewhat limited information is a bit tricky.

A few easy things to truy

go home-->add ons--> search for 'mingw'. The first result should be something like 'MATLAB Support for MinGW-w64 C/C++ Compiler'. Install it if it isnt already. Then run `mex -setup c` and `mex -setup c++` to ensure MinGW64 is the selected compiler. You dont mention the compiler your using, and if you havent explicitly set one up you probably arent going to be doing much compiling.

You can also try adding `['-fPIC','/usr/local/lib/librfftw.a']` to somewhere in line 41. Order can be important, so maybe try adding it a few different places (adding it to the end is probably a good place to start).

You can get more info by adding the '-v' flag (e.g., `mex('-v','-O',...)`). This will give the actual commands being sent to the compiler. Somewhere there will be `/usr/local/lib/librfftw.a` that needs to be changed to `-fPIC  /usr/local/lib/librfftw.a`. If you can find this and manually re-run the commands output by `mex -v ...` (with the above substitution) it might work.

Other than that, your best bet is probably to contact the original code writer or try installing whatever version of matlab the code was designed to be compiled on (probably an older one).",1521577980.0

shtpst,"I'm not sure how best to approach this, because your question appears to be using an econometrics toolbox. I'm not sure how familiar you are with state space models in general or whether you have access to the Control System Toolbox and the `lsim` command. 

As a (control) engineer, `lsim` is the tool I would use to simulate state space systems. I'm not sure of your application, and your terminology is not naturally familiar to me and it's not defined in your question, so I'm not sure what exactly it's supposed to be. You have a `B`, `c`, and `C`, and none of those are in the equations you gave for your models.

So, I'll try to give you some feedback as a control engineer and how I ""phrase"" state space problems.

First, the state variable equation is `xDot = Ax + Bu`. The derivative of your state(s), `xDot`, is the result of the states themselves, `x`, as modified by the ""state matrix"" `A`, combined with some input, `u`, modified by the ""input matrix"" `B`. 

In your case, you have ""error terms in the state-equation,"" but I don't know what that means. **What are ""error terms?""** Traditionally, at least in the controls field, an ""error term"" as *I* know it is the difference between some target/reference and a measurement. If you want to be going 60mph, and you are actually going 55mph, you have a *speed error* of +5mph, which is the reference minus the feedback. 

For you, I think the ""error terms"" are one of two things:

1.  An actual error term, in that there is a reference and a feedback, or
2.  An ""exogenous input,"" in that it's just some random term that gets incorporated into your state equation but is actually not dependent on any state. 

If it's an actual error term, then you should rephrase it as such. If, for example, you have a reference input that I'll call `r`, and your error term `e` is `r - y`, then you can use the definition of `y` you gave in your question (`y = Jx`) and come up with `e = r - Jx`. Now you can substitute that into your state equation `xDot = Ax + Bu`, or in your case `xDot = Ax + e`, and get `xDot = Ax + (r - Jx)`. You can rearrange to get `xDot = (A - J)x + r`, which would be the more traditional way of expressing this. This method of `(A - J)x` should be immediately familiar to anyone that has studied state feedback controls (compare with `(A - BG)x`. This is how control poles are moved. 

You say that there is a ""correlation"" between the error terms, but again, you haven't stated what the error terms actually are, so it's hard to give help beyond what I've stated above. Are the error terms just random inputs? Are they random but dependent on states? 

*You need to be able to give an expression for the error terms.* If you can't (mathematically) explain what the error terms are, then you're not going to be able to put those terms into state space form and simulate it with a built-in tool.

I'll add too that it looks like you're initializing the random number generator. If there is noise in your system, you need to determine where that noise is occurring so you can model it correctly. Disturbance inputs, process noise, measurement noise - these all happen at different points in the system and affect the system differently. 

I'll just leave this post as is, because there isn't much more I can do to help without understanding more of what you're actually trying to simulate. ",1521471075.0

Storpige5000,"Lets say you have 30 observations of Y, and 30 observations of each of the 5 variables. First of all: Put your Y variables into column format. You can do this simply by

greatdanton1,"The initiation button callback function should work for this, assuming that you don't have to manipulate the figure while data is being collected, as you might not be able to pause and resume the data collection depending on how the callback function and arduino is coded.

One of the nicer features of figures or guis in matlab is that all of the data is accessible if you can find the proper figure or object handles. For instance, using the axes handle of each plot (found by checking hObject.children or hObject.parent.children(n) or something, just look for the axes handles), you can get the plotted data (i.e. hAxes.XData or from the line object within the plot). For a real time update, it is possible to use this in order to only update the necessary data, instead of replotting the entire figure. What I would do is loop through or hardcode the handles of each set of axes (or plot) in a cell or struct array, and select only the new data from the arduino to add to the x and y data of each plot, then if the axes limits are set to auto it should readjust, otherwise you'll need to determine the limits based on the data range or a predefined variable. This limits the amount of plotting MATLAB is doing, and should make realtime updates much more efficient.

As this might be a little confusing, here are a couple examples of how figure data can be accessed and updated. Let me know if you have any questions.

The [toeplitz](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/toeplitz.html) documentation shows the form of the convolution matrix, or you can just use `convmtx` on an example and see. Its pretty easy to build this matrix.

2) (circular) convolution in the time domain is the same as multiplicaztion in the frequency domain.

You can think about eigenvalues and eigenvectors as kind of analogous to the coordinate axes on a graph. For a simple 2D case, the ""standard"" euclidean axes (`x` and `y`) correspond to eigenvectors [0 1] and [1 0]. But, you can tilt one of the axis and/or change the spacing and still be able to reach any point in the 2D plane with your new axes (say, `n` and `m`), but a given point will have different coordinates in `(x,y)` space than in `(n,m)` space. 

Eigenvectors are analogous to the ""tilt"" of the axes and describe what direction you need to travel in such that only `var1` or `var2` is changing in value and the other is not (i.e., one is independent of the other).  The eigenvalues are related to how ""wide"" a difference of '1 unit' is on the two axes, and gives a measure of how ""sensitive"" the matrix system is to changes along the direction of that particular orthogonal basis vector (via matrix-vector multiplication).

Eigenvalue decomposition ends up being handy in a lot of problems for much the same reason that axes and handy in plots - knowing what direction to travel in such that only one variable is changing (or, in this case, understanding what the orthogonal basis vectors are)  and knowing how quickly the variable is changing in that direction are very useful pieces of information.",1520742105.0

Storpige5000,"Hello, if you know how to obtain a discretized expression for your continuous process, and the process assumes a known distribution for the errors, then max likelihood is feasible. It is not super hard though.

Step 1:

Write a matlab function that takes a vector of parameters (a,b,g,sigma) as its first input (important for optimization routines o nthe function) and the observed data as the second input.

In the function, compute the implied epsilons (your normally distributed variable) given the variable vector. E.g. if your model is b0+b1*x+e = y then compute a vector of y-b0-b1*x where b0 and b1 reference the inputs in your parameter vector. 

You now have a vector with the errors implied by your parameters. To do MLE, you must assume that they follow a particular likelihood (here you assume standard normal.) Next step is to compute a vector of the likelihoods of each observation. 

Last part of the function is to take the sum of the likelihoods (and put a minus sign in front of it, because matlabs built in optimization only minimizes. Minimizing the negative function is equivalent to maximizing the original function.) 

Step 2:

Use the fmincon function to minimize the negative likelihood function by changing the input parameters. By numerical optimization, it tries different values for the parameter vector and returns the one that minimizes the negative likelihood (= chooses that parameters that yield the highest probability of drawing your sample.)

Descriptive variable names will allow someone to *read* the code. As it stands, I don't know what `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `i`, `p`, `q`, or `z` are supposed to be. 

I don't know why your code loops 1:10000 and picks random numbers. 

I don't know why your white space is so crazy. 

Most of all, 

> I am hoping to get help to further my project.

I don't know what *specifically* you need help with. 

Why are you assigning `ans = e` and `ans = f` and `ans = sum(g)` at the end? 

You said, 

> I believe that I am able to input the money I have, and it will give me the max amount of calories I am able to get with the set amount of money

But I would bet your code won't run, since you declare an output (`food`) in the function definition but then never initialize or assign anything to `food`. 

The more I look at this, the worse it gets. You define `i = 1;`, then say `for i = 1:10000`, then later, *in the loop*, say `i = i + 1`. 

You declare `a` to be a 3x3 matrix, but pull values by *linear indexing* and thus only ever pull the first column of values; columns two and three are ignored. 

You have some pointless logic - you set `f = b`, and then set `g = f.*z`. You *also* set `h = b.*z`, but `f=b`, so `g==h`. Then you check `if sum(g) < sum(h)`, but again, `g == h`, so they're *always equal*.

There's no `break` or `return` or other loop control, and everything seems to revolve around `b`, which is set by random numbers, in a seemingly arbitrarily long loop (`10000`). 

You don't ever accumulate a value, so there's no `maxValue` or any other means of comparing one iteration to another. 

You take some inputs, loop through random numbers 10,000 times, then keep the results only of the last iteration.

Edit 2: also, you're not getting any errors. You're getting a warning, which is telling you that you are doing something unwise, but that the function will still work, at least for now. Often warnings like this are a sign that what you're doing won't work in future versions. ",1520338357.0
shtpst,"You posted an image, not text, so I'm not going to bother to type out your problem by hand. 

1.  Use `syms <var>` for every variable you don't have numbers for. 
2.  Be careful when passing **expressions** to the solver. Those *are* expressions because an *equation* has an *equal* sign in it. The `solve` function will assume `expression == 0`, which may or may not be what you want. 
3.  I would bet that you have your `eq1`, etc. defined in character arrays `'<stuff>'` because it errors out if you don't, because you didn't define the ancillary things (a, E, I, etc.). Refer to point 1 - make them symbolic. Then you can just write your *expression* like anything else (i.e., without quotes). 
4.  If you're going to make a system of equations to pass to solve, you need *one variable* that has all your equations, and *one variable* that has all the terms for which you'd like to solve. The easy way to do this is to say `eq(1) = ...` and `eq(2) = ...`, etc. Then, when you call `solve`, pass `solve(eq, [c1, c2, c1R, c2R])`. There you have `eq` as a vector of *expressions* and the second input to `solve` is a vector of things for which you'd like to solve.
5.  I'll point out that you don't actually have an error here, you have a warning. Again, you didn't provide text and I'm too lazy to type your problem, but you *did* get something. You can see that with `ans = c1: [1x1 sym]`, etc. The output of `solve` is a structure that has all of your variables. The problem you're having is that you just call `solve()` without assigning the output anywhere, so Matlab stashes it in a temporary variable called `ans`. You can still see what's in it if you call `ans.c1`, but then it's likely to overwrite `ans` when it displays what's in `ans.c1`. You would typically do something like `eqnSoln = solve(<stuff>)` and then you could check the results with `eqnSoln.c1`, `eqnSoln.c2`, etc. ",1520345456.0

annuges,"The issue here is that Matlab on its own is a pretty slow language. You generally want to do as little as possible in actual matlab code and this means you should not use loops for performance critical applications if you can avoid it.
Vectorizing is good because it allows matlab to delegate execution to optimized C code instead of having to process it on its own.

Generally it means that instead of having a loop that processes each element of a vector with some function you take the entire vector and pass it to the function in one chunk.

Instead of:
    for i = 1:length(x)
        z(i)=sin(x(i)) * cos(y(i))
    end

You would write
    z=sin(x).*cos(y)

Instead of having to to the loop in pure matlab, this passes the vector x to a vectorized sin function that loops over the elements in C where it is fast and does the elementwise sin there. Then it passes the y vector to the cos function that also does the fast c loop over its elements. Then the two result vectors are similarly multiplied element wise. The dot in front of the multiplication sign is to indicate that this is supposed to be an element wise multiplication, not a matrix multiplication.

You can see how that array focused vectorized style can be quite convenient to write concise code for many situations. The thing you need to understand is that in Matlab it’s not just good for readability but critical for performance.

",1520234540.0
FrickinLazerBeams,"As others have said, vectorizing is faster by far.

However, to answer your original question, yes, sometimes with large data, you must use a loop to read the data in chunks an then process it using vector operations. You do this when you can't fit all the data in memory at once.

On the other hand, what you're describing is not ""large data"". It's only 40 million data points. That's pretty medium sized. Nobody would really call data ""large"" until you're talking about multiple tens of gigabytes. ",1520252320.0

shtpst,"Matlab is (was?) a scripted language . It doesn't (didn't?) compile, so it has (had) to wait for the OS between every step. If you loop, then you have at least as many steps as there are loops (more, if you have more than one line of code in the loop), which means you have to wait for the OS however many times there are loops. 

Matlab has its own functions behind the scenes that *are* compiled, but you have to give it everything all at once to make use of the compiled functions. 

They've done a lot of work in the last couple releases to ""optimize loops,"" which *has* made a big difference in how a lot of stuff runs. This was done by implementing a compiler ([just-in-time compiler](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/matlab-execution-engine.html)), which removes most or all of the OS wait time between steps. 

Matlab still has an army of mathematicians working for them, though, and there is still a lot of work that they've done to optimize matrix operations with tricks (black magic) to bypass the typical long-division-style drawn out way of doing things you were taught in school. For example, Matlab probably doesn't calculate a [matrix determinant the way you were taught](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/det.html#bubft79-5), so if you tried a looping version of a determinant calculation (or again, most any other matrix operation), then Matlab's method is going to win because they had a bunch of PhDs optimize their matrix operations, again using black magic. 

You can utilize their black magic and get some pretty significant speed advantages if you can ""rephrase"" your problem, loop, etc. to be a matrix operation. This what people mean when they refer to ""vectorization,"" because typically they have a bunch of <things> they want to do <stuff> with, and when you append <things> together into a ""list"" then that's called a *vector*, and you can then do vector-matrix math and reap the advantages of the optimized matrix operations.

The easiest example I can think of immediately is coordinate transforms. You might 10,000 points you want to transform. You could loop through all 10,000 points, or you could just do the `[transform matrix]*[points vector]` operation and be done in one step. ",1520346655.0

CaptainBatpants,"Since the data set is so small, you don't really need to worry about having the most efficient, vectorized solution. I would just do a for loop to look at every element of the data set. 

You can use a **flag** to track if an event is happening or not. I often will use if/else structures for this.

You could use a **counter** to track how many events happen. You generally would initialize both the flag and counter before starting your loop. Both of these concepts are very common for datasets like these.

Finally, I would recommend making another array to store the lengths of each event.

    alarmFlag = 0; 
    eventCounter = 0;
    events = [];
    for i=1:length(datasetname)

    % logic goes here

    end

Using if/else logic, you can flip the alarm flag to 1 (true) or 0 (false). Each time you detect that the alarm state changes, you can increase the eventCounter value.

You can use the ""eventCounter"" variable as the index of your ""events"" array.

I don't think any simple solution exists against unintentionally doing such an operation in your code.

Weed_O_Whirler,"To understand what's happening, you have to understand workspaces. In MATLAB, you have a workspace called ""base"" which is in the main window, all of the variables you declared and you and open them up and see them in the variable editor windows. Scripts work on the base workspace. 

Functions have their own workspace, called a local workspace. They only see variables which are handed in to them, or ones which are declared inside of them. They are blind to the base workspace, and only see their local. If you're a new program, you might think this is stupid. But as you keep working in programming (and not just MALTAB, all languages are like this) you'll appreciate this. 

So, in your case, you're running a script to set variables, but that script sets variables in the base workspace. You then call the function, and all of those variables are gone. 

The easiest way to do fix this is to move your declarations inside of your function. Then, they will get set in the function, and be available in the local workspace. You can also do something similar to what you were trying to do with your ""declared variables list"" by using a `classdef` but honestly it's probably over kill and I'd just do the first method.

CaptainBatpants,"As someone who did a master's thesis in trajectory optimization, I want to tell you that finding a truly ""optimal"" solution is doable, but difficult and requires some real research. Instead of going the 'fmincon' route with this problem, I would recommend studying real race lines. Make a heuristic solution. Find something that's close to optimal (i.e. not perfect), but good enough.

As for the governing equations, if you're in 2D, here is what I recommend:

Each trajectory must be discretized. This means that you will represent your  continuous solution as a set of points. Use a point mass model. Each point along the trajectory will have 4 states: x position, y position, speed, and heading angle. You can enforce a constraint on heading angle rate using the centripetal force equation and geometry:

`F = m*g*mu = (m*v^2)/r`

`Omega_max = v/r`

At a conceptual level, you want to minimize the time required to travel from point A to point B.

`t = d/v`

You'll generally want to travel at the highest speed possible while still having enough side force to allow your turns.

Weed_O_Whirler,"There is a difference between ""errors"" and ""warnings."" Errors stop your program from running. They are indicated by red lines in the editor, and when you run your program, it produces red ink in the command window. Warnings are indicated by yellow lines in the editors, or yellow words when you run your program. They are not things which stop your program from running, but a guess from MATLAB that you're doing something inefficiently or have a mistake. Let's look at your warning: 

> the variable “xxxxx” appears to change size for every loop iteration

It also continues to say ""consider pre-allocating your array."" 

This means exactly what it says: the size of your variable (take, position for instance) changes every time you run your program. The first time through your loop position is length 1, then the next time it's length 2, etc. Every time you step through your loop, MATLAB has to destroy the variable and build a new, bigger variable to hold your data. 

What it tells you to do is pre-allocate your array. With `for` loops this is very easy- you know exactly how many steps you're going to take (`Nwalk` in your case). So, you can say:

    position = zeros(1,Nwalk);

and now you have made `position` a `1xNwalk` array of zeros, and then you can just fill in each new value. This will run much, much faster (you might not notice on a program like this, as I bet it runs really fast anyway, but once you start doing bigger computations, this change will make very noticeable improvements. I once inherited code that didn't do this, and it took 3-4 minutes to execute. After pre-allocating my arrays, it changed to 5-6 seconds to execute).

There are different solutions to numerical issues like this depending on their exact cause.

The solution in this case is to apply logarithms so you transform the problem to exp(x + log(erf(-x))), thus avoiding the problematic multiplication.

1) I think it will roughly
2) at the end you set the latch pin from 1 to 0, I believe it needs to be set to 1 to end the full transmission. Setting it to 0 again will have it in a state waiting for new input to be shifted on the next clock pulse.
3) No you do not need to use the reset pin, its only purpose is to ""clear"" the outputs. Unless this is a desired feature. Can be connected to Vcc to disable.
4) Output enable is a required pin for use since if you disable the output, all of the outputs will be put into a a high impedance state. Just ground this pin on your breadboard so the outputs are always enabled.
5) No you don't have to use all pins. For the outputs you do not need to connect the unused outputs to anything. More info on what to do with unused inputs or outputs can be found in this [datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hc595.pdf) pg 16 for the 74hc595 ",1519614370.0

TheQueq,"Looks like your initial value isn't set properly.

From what I'm reading, at t=0, y=1 should be your initial condition.  For ode45() in matlab, the syntax is:

    sol = ode45(ODEFUN, [T0 TFinal], Y0,OPTIONS)

So T0 should be 0, where you wrote 0.3.  TFinal should probably be 0.31 or 0.36.

With those values things will look closer to what you expect, although you may find that ode45 still doesn't like going to infinity.  You can use `OPTIONS=odeset(...)` to change the tolerances of ode45 to get a more accurate result. (Use `help odeset` to get a list of allowable options - AbsTol, RelTol, and Refine may be particularly useful, but feel free to play with the other options too).

ryzic,"To answer your question on why you're getting only one output...

What do you want your output to look like?  Do you want to print your triangles to the screen?  Do you want a char matrix containing '*' and ' '?

I'm going to assume you want to print to the screen just for example.  None of your statements print, so what happens when you call it as `triangle(5)`?

    n = 5
    if 5 > 0 % yes
      tr = repmat('*', 1, 5); % tr = '*****'
      triangle(4);
    end

Notice that you aren't assigning tr in your recursive call.  the `tr` that is returned is only ever the one from the top function.  To fix the printing version, you could do something like this:

    function print_left_triangle(n)
      if n > 0
        disp(repmat('*', 1, n));
        print_left_triangle(n-1);

shtpst,"Hello! It's been a while since I looked at heat and mass transfer stuff, but I *am* a mechanical engineer. Side note - put the ` symbol around equations to get them formatted as code. It's the same key as tilde ~. If you don't, then 

`A*B*\DeltaT` comes out as A*B*\DeltaT.

So, I'm assuming that you have:

1.  Thermal power out of hydrogen = thermal power into water, 
2.  Inlet *temperatures* for water and hydrogen are fixed, 
3.  Inlet *mass flow rate* for hydrogen is fixed, and finally
4.  You want to vary the mass flow rate of the water to control the outlet temperature of the hydrogen. 

You seemed to toggle between `m_w` (mass of water, I'm assuming) and `m_c` (mass of ""cold,"" I'm assuming), but I think they both mean the same thing. You have water and hydrogen, so I'll just use `_w` and `_h`, respectively. 

You have to figure out the heat exchanger parameters, first. The formula for a heat exchanger (`_hx`) is:

    Qdot_hx = U_hx * A_hx * DeltaT_lm

where `U_hx` is the heat exchanger heat transfer coefficient, `A_hx` is the surface area of the heat exchanger, and `DeltaT_lm` is the ""log mean temperature difference,"" given by:

    DeltaT_lm = ((T_h_in - T_w_out) - (T_h_out - T_w_in)) / ...
        log( (T_h_in - T_w_out) / (T_h_out - T_w_in));

where here `T_h_in` is hydrogen inlet temperature, `T_w_in` is water inlet temperature, etc. 

Recognize that:

    Qdot_h = mdot_h * c_h * (T_h_out - T_h_in);
    Qdot_w = mdot_w * c_w * (T_w_out - T_w_in);

Assuming no loss of power anywhere, then

    Qdot_h + Qdot_w = 0;

Or 

    Qdot_h = -Qdot_w;

which can be restated as:

    mdot_h * c_h * (T_h_out - T_h_in) = mdot_w * c_w * (T_w_out - T_w_in);

The problem is, you know *everything* about what you want the hydrogen to be, but you don't know the mass flow rate of the water **and** you don't know its outlet temperature. 

This is where the heat exchanger equation comes into play. You have to pick something somewhere. You can either pick a target water mass flow rate, and find out what the required outlet temperature is from the thermal power equation, or you can use heat exchanger data for the heat exchanger you're using and find out what the outlet temperature of the water needs to be from the heat exchanger formula and then find the mass flow rate. 

Whichever your route, you have two equations - conservation of thermal power and the heat exchanger power, and (at least) three unknowns - water mass flow rate, water outlet temperature, and heat exchanger thermal transfer capacity (`U_hx *A_hx`).

Once you pick one unknown to be *something*, then you can figure out what your *steady state* values are for everything else. You could, of course, just use the conservation of thermal power and have two unknowns and one equation - you still have to pick one, but utilizing the heat exchanger equation gives you some bounds on how ""reasonable"" the output temperature equation is. You could pick heat exchanger material thickness and material to calculate a `U_hx`, pick an approximate surface area based on tube diameter, number of tubes, and overall length, then get an *engineering basis* for your other numbers (mass flow of water and water outlet temperature). 

The tricky bit comes when it's time to simulate how the fluids respond to fluctuations in flow, and this is where the heat exchanger equation really shines. If you don't want an engineering basis for your heat exchanger numbers, you still really need this to get your simulation running. 

Imagine the instant you start up the heat exchanger - inlet and outlet temperatures are equal for one side because the fluid hasn't been admitted by the other side yet. According to the thermal power equation, thermal power is zero, because the temperature delta is zero, so you wind up with no good way of getting your simulation running. The log mean temperature delta only compares one fluid to the other, never a fluid to itself, so you never wind up with the zero values that you do with the thermal power equation. 

So, if you choose not to use the physical heat exchanger parameters, you still need to calculate the `U_hx * A_hx` term as a bulk ""heat exchanger coefficient"" to use the heat exchanger equation to get the thermal power exchanged between fluids.

The last step here is to accrue the thermal power by multiplying thermal power by the time step, such that `Q_added = Q_added + Qdot*dT`, where `dT` is whatever time sample size that you have for your system. If you're doing this in Simulink, then I think you can just integrate `Qdot`, but I'm not a Simulink guy so I couldn't really say for sure.

Anyways, once you have your Q term, now look at the mass of fluid in the heat exchanger and solve for the temperature difference required to achieve the total heat in the working fluid. You'll find that, the more mass in the heat exchanger, the slower the system is to respond to fluctuations. Mass will depend on *volume* in the heat exchanger (and operating pressure, for the hydrogen), so again it's a good practice to try to put some bounding limitations on how the thing is physically arranged. 

Probably a wall of text, but hope that it helps :)

3) when the program is ready to ask for input, have it write uint8(1) to the file and pause execution except to periodically re-read the specified binary file.

4) when matlab seen the value hanged to 1, request user input

5) after receiving user input, write the inputted characters to an ascii file with some pre-set name. After the write is  finished, go back to the binary file aand overwirte with uint8(0)

if you want the bounds to come from the actual distribution of the data, look at pulling percentiles (like the 5th, 10th, or 25th from the top and bottom).

    wingAngles = sort(wingAngles);
    numAngles = length(wingAngles);
    bottom = wingAngles(round(.05*numAngles)); % 5th percentile
    top = wingAngles(round(.95*numAngles)); % 95th 

if you go with the percentiles, i'd recommend bumping up your Monte Carlo runs a bit more.

> 2.  ODE45 finds the discontinuity and stops with a warning message ""Unable to meet integration tolerances without reducing the step size below the smallest value allowed"".
> 3.  ODE45 reduces the step size to such a tiny value, that the integration takes hours to run and the accumulated rounding error dominates the solution. This is exactly what the step size control should avoid.

Say you have your matrix 'X'. And you want columns 2-4 into a single array.

Here's what that code looks like:

1. Calculate the new position after a single step by generating a NEW step distance for some reason instead of using the step distance you already calculated
1. Set a value for the absolute distance to the fence (in a peculiar place, and in every single iteration of the loop, the same value)
1. Set a value for a new variable 'steps' equal to the current position after j steps plus the 2-vector containing the fence distance (every iteration, a pair of values, 20 apart from one another)
1. Iterate over 3-6 100 times
1. After all iterations provide the last value for steps calculated (the total distance of the 100th step +/- 10)
1. Compute the average of the two values in the vector, aka just the position of the last step

Furthermore, it does not calculate the *number of steps*, but the *distance to each fence* of the zombie after 100 steps.  Each of those 100 walks should contain the code necessary to compute the number of steps for *one* zombie.  Hint:  how many times did you need to make that zombie take a step?  You also need a way to find out if the zombie hit the fence or not.  Hint:  The fence has a distance from zero, B.  What condition would be necessary for the zombie to hit the fence?

Finally, you can post clean-looking code by inserting 4 spaces before each line.  This can easily be done in MATLAB by selecting the code you'd like to share in the editor, pressing tab (to insert the spaces), and then copy/pasting in the post/comment field.

    E_sum = P - Alfa * A * ( T - T_inf ); %Calculate energi added
    
    dTdt = E_sum / ( cp * M_i ); %Find scale for timestep
    
    dT = dTdt * dt; %Scale and timestep product
    
    T = T + dT; %rise in temperatur add up
    
    t = t + dt; %Time add up

I have to make a plot of the time and temperature, but can't figure out how to handle the timesteps in simulink and how to make an Initital condition of 20 deg C that should reach 100 deg C.

I know this is a really newb question but i can't figure out how to make it work :(",1518011647.0

2PetitsVerres,"I'm not exactly sure of what you are looking for exactly, but I have two things in mind when I see your question. One of them may be easy (depending on what you wan to do exactly, maybe it's not possible) and the second one may be more ""correct"" but more complex. (I'm not at all experimented with the second method)

## Method 1: easy but not always applicable

Let's start with the easy one (but not completely correct, if you want my opinion. But it may be enough for you). One of the hypothesis that needs to hold is that you model is a single rate model. To check that, you can display all the rates in the model by going to the menu : _Display --> Sample Time --> All_. This will put color inside your model, and open a window with the legend of the colors. If you only have one sample time (or one sample time + one infinite sample time), you are good to go for this method.

The way I think you can do what you want is to simply generate the code from your model. In that case, the generated code should several things, but the second most important thing (IHMO) that is generated is the model_step() function (with ""model"" being the name of your model). This is the function that you will have to call at a certain frequency. 

If you go to see the ""Code generation report"" (which is the most important thing generated, IMHO. Also I think it's generated by default in the most recent versions of Embedded Coder. If it doesn't open when you generate the code, you can enable its generation in the model configuration parameters, under Code Generation -> Report), there is a section called ""Code Interface Report"". Basically, for a simple single rate model, this part tells you that you have 3 (or 2) functions to call (where ""model"" is the name of your model):

- model_initialize(): ""Must be called exactly once"" (at the beginning)
- model_step(): **""Must be called periodically, every X seconds""**
- model_terminate(): ""Must be called exactly once"" (not always generated, to be called at the end of your program, if you reach it)

Depending on what you do exactly in your model, if you have a single rate, it may be possible to call model_step() at another frequency than ""every X seconds"", at the frequency that you want.

If you do that, you need to be sure that your sample time is not used to define the value of parameters (and if it is used for that, you need to change these parameter according to the desired frequency)

## Method 2: probably more correct, but more complex (maybe?)

This is similar to the other answer in this thread. You should use an ""Export function model"". I'm not going to explain precisely what an Export function model is (because I'm not able to do it accurately) but the documentation explains it. The relevant starting pages are [Export-Function Models](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/export-function-models.html) and [Generate C Function Code for them](https://www.mathworks.com/help/ecoder/examples/exporting-functions.html)

In short and maybe not accurate, an export-function model is a model where the execution of the blocks is controlled by outside signal. So you should have a model containing your current function, and another parent model, referring the first one, and ""scheduling"" it. This parent model will likely use some stateflow for that. You should read the doc to see if this can solve your problem, I'm not 100% sure that it is the correct solution.",1518108062.0

jewish-mel-gibson,"**tl;dr: The solution is to use biograph and use**

    view(biograph(A,B))

**where A is your adjacency matrix, B is a character array of labels for your nodes, where B(a) is the element corresponding to the node in A(a,:).**  

---------------------------------------------------

Swell community y'all have here. Honest question, plenty of detail, courteous, and yet downvotes the whole way down.

Fortunately, I found a solution, and since I'm not a misanthrope but also really petty, I'm happy to share it in detail if anyone else happens to stumble across this looking for an answer.

My solution is rather specific to causal sets, because that's what I'm working on, but hopefully it might be useful for anyone else trying to create a DAG (directed acyclic graph) for any other reason.

You must create a [biograph](https://se.mathworks.com/help/bioinfo/ref/biograph.html) object. If you already have a causal set (or any adjacency matrix) and have been able to plot it the way I was using digraph, you simply create a biograph object using

    h = biograph(your_link_matrix,label_array);
    view(h)

**your_link_matrix is the adjacency matrix** that represents the ordering relation between your events.

----------------------------------------------

*(Note for anyone working on causal sets: If your set includes ""A precedes B"" and ""B is preceded by A"", you will need to reduce the matrix by removing one of these ""equivalent"" relations, such that you have only 1's in your matrix. In other words, for a causal set with two events, A and B with matrix representation*

    causalset = 0 1
               -1 0

*you must remove the -1 and set it to zero, which is fine because it is redundant. If you use anything else to denote this relationship, you must change whatever number you have for the statement ""causally precedes"" to 1. If you are not working on causal sets and have no idea what I'm talking about, disregard this.)*

----------------------------------------------------

**label_array is a character array** for the events in your causal set. If you are using all of the points in your causal set, then the row number of your matrix is simply the label of your nodes. For instance, if your adjacency matrix looks like this:

    adjacency_matrix = 0 0 1 0
                       0 0 1 0
                      -1-1 0 1
                       0 0-1 0

Then you can simply create the label_array using the following code:

    label_array={};
    for a=1:length(adjmatrix(1,:))
     label_array = horzcat(label_array,num2str(a));
    end

(An adjacency matrix must be square anyway, so all rows/columns must have the same length.) If you want to create custom labels, I believe you will need to do that manually.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*Another note for anyone else working on causal sets, and possibly others: most causal sets must, of course, be pretty large--possibly on the order of 10,000 points, and in that context, you may have found my diagram to be a little...lacking. As you may have seen in my code, to make the Hasse diagram understandable, I have selected a random event in the causal set, which I call ""spot"" and plotted its ""nearest neighbors"". I created a distance matrix using*

    dist = distances(digraph(abs((causalset))));

*then decided on the distance of nearest neighbors, which I called ""hood"", and enumerated all the events within that distance putting them into an array I called ""neighborhood"", using*

    neighborhood = zeros(1,1);
    for a=1:m
        if dist(spot,a)<=hood
            neighborhood = horzcat(neighborhood,a);
        end
    end
    neighborhood(1) = [];

*Then, I extracted that ""neighborhood"" from the causal set and removed the redundant relations using*

    subset = causalset(neighborhood,neighborhood);
    subsetfixed = subset;
    for a=1:length(subset)
        for b=1:length(subset)
            if subsetfixed(a,b) == -1
                subsetfixed(a,b) = 0;
            end
        end
    end

*You can keep the original labels of the largest set using the lines*

    label_array={};
    for a=1:length(neighborhood)
        label_array = horzcat(label_array,num2str(neighborhood(a)));
    end

*instead of the the lines used to create the label array above.*

*Finally, you can denote those events in the subset that are connected to the entire event and use them to edit your labels by using*

    edges=zeros(1,1);
    for a=1:length(neighborhood)
        for b=1:m
            if causalset(neighborhood(a),b) ~=0 && dist(neighborhood(a),b)==1 && ismember(b,neighborhood)==0
                edges=horzcat(edges,neighborhood(a));
            end
        end
    end
    edges(1)=[];
    edges=unique(edges);

*then labeling them with an asterisk using*

    edgelabel={};
    for a=1:length(edges)
        edgelabel=horzcat(edgelabel,num2str(edges(a)));
    end
    for a=1:length(label_array)
        if ismember(label_array{a},edgelabel)
            label_array{a}=pad(label_array{a},length(label_array{a})+1,'right','*');
        end
    end

*and also label the ""center"" of the subset that you extracted with an ""O"" for ""origin"" using*
    
    for a=1:length(label_array)
        if strcmp(label_array{a},spot)==1
            label_array{a}=pad(label_array{a},length(label_array{a})+1,'right','O');
        end
    end
---------------------------------------------------------

One problem I have noticed is that my Hasse diagram is ""upside down"", but changing the layout of view(biograph) is not as simple as most other matlab figures and there seems to be little documentation on how to do this. A quick fix is to select File > Print to Figure in the Biograph Viewer, then in the Figure window that produces, select ""rotate 3D"" either from the icon in the toolbar in the top or Tools > Rotate 3D. Or, even more simply, just type ""axis ij"" in the command window.

If anyone is working on this and found any of this unclear, feel free to ask questions or PM me. I apologize in advance if my code is a little unclear or poorly written, but it suffices to say that [it gets the job done :D](https://imgur.com/a/whemj)!

You've defined your function to return a value `A`, when you said:

    function [ A ] = mpay(P, n, ai)

So you told Matlab to return a value. Any time you want an output suppressed in Matlab, you need to terminate the line with a semicolon. It looks like you're not using the output, so I would guess you're calling the function:

    mpay(4000, 48, 0.03875)

To your question:

Your question is about why you have to push return twice to get the value in a box to display. At first, I didn't have this issue because I clicked off the box before hitting return. The problem seems to be that, after you enter a value in the box, striking return simultaneously writes that value to the uicontrol **and** calls your `KeyPress` function. The function then grabs the value in the uicontrol *before* the uicontrol has a chance to update. 

The solution? Wait a little bit before grabbing the uicontrol value. It looks like putting a `pause(0.001);` anywhere between the `KeyPress` declaration and the first time you pull data is enough of a delay to let the value update. ",1517323213.0

With that in mind, and given your preference for signal processing, statistics, and finance, why not try to make some data visualizers for finance data? 

Maybe write a script that gathers stock values over a particular duration of time. Fit a line to the data, then have the line get wider as the R^2 value gets closer to one and have the line get more green or red depending on the magnitude of the slope of the line.

Try making a GUI that lets you enter a stock symbol(s) and select dates and have it fetch/scrape trend data for that period.

TheQueq,"Fifteen lines is a lot to display in a single figure.  The answer really depends on your data.  If your lines don't cross, then you can use an alternating pattern (solid line, dashed line, solid line, dashed line, etc.).  If they do cross, then you might consider splitting the data into multiple figures.  If there's some natural subdivision, you might be able to bring it down to four lines per figure, which is much easier to manage.

Ultimately, fifteen lines in black and white will almost certainly be indistinguishable.  Try to decide what conclusions you're drawing from the data, and group the lines in way that will emphasize that.  For example, if each line represents a different test velocity, then you might group them into low, medium, and high velocities, allowing you to use only three patterns/colours.

If you absolutely must, then you can pick 3-4 colours that range from dark to light when printed in black and white (the best way to check this is to actually print it and see how it looks), then use patterns to further distinguish the lines.  This will still tend to be a very messy figure, but for some data it will be effective.  As an example, you might get:  
1. black solid,  
2. (dark) blue solid,  
3. (light) red solid,  
4. black long dashes,  
5. blue long dashes,  
6. red long dashes,  
7. black short dashes,
8. blue short dashes,  
9. red short dashes,  
10. black dotted,  
11. blue dotted,  
12. red dotted,  
13. black dash-dot,  
14. blue dash-dot, and  
15. red dash-dot.

As I mention, the above may work for some data sets, but not others.  One advantage is that you can group data in two ways.  If, for example, you are showing the effect of temperature and pressure variation, then the colour could correspond to temperature, and the linetype to pressure.  However, it is often simpler just to have separate plots for each pressure or each temperature.

Regarding colours, I find that you can safely use black, red, and blue, and can usually add green* and orange - in that order.  Beyond that, it can be difficult to keep the colours distinguishable. *Note that green and red will cause difficulties for roughly 5% of the population due to colour blindness - this can often be fixed by using a bright/light red and a darker forest green (or alternately, use a dark maroonish red and a bright/light green).

That said, how are you trying to use `parfor` in a set of functions that never use a `for` loop??

> I struggled using parfor to parallelize because it behaves strangely with indexing order and I don't understand it.

Well, yeah. First, **there is no `for` or `parfor` in the code you posted**. Anywhere. Second, you don't appear to index any of the data anywhere. The only indexing I can see is when you make some random checks. 

1.  Read the documentation on the functions that give you trouble.
2.  Post the shortest, most concise code you can that still gives you the error you're seeing when you're asking for help. 

When you *[read the documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/parfor.html)*, you can see:

> Unlike a traditional for-loop, iterations are not executed in a guaranteed order.

The `parfor` command splits a `for` loop into blocks. If you had three workers, the first one gets the first third, second gets the second, etc. If you had, say, 33 iterations in the total loop, iteration 12 will probably complete before iteration 11, because 12 is the first iteration for worker two, but 11 is the last iteration for worker 1. 

*You can't use `parfor` loops where one iteration depends on the results of another iteration.* 

From the [parfor topic documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/distcomp/parfor.html) (as opposed to the parfor command documentation):

> * Loop iterations are executed in parallel in a nondeterministic order. This means that you might need to modify your code to use parfor. For more help, see Convert for-Loops Into parfor-Loops.
> 
> * The body of the parfor-loop must be independent. One loop iteration cannot depend on a previous iteration, because the iterations are executed in a nondeterministic order. For more help, see Ensure That parfor-Loop Iterations are Independent.

The data that's not being zero-padded still needs to be sampled properly and windowed properly.

So, let's try an example. Make a bunch of forces and displacements, then make a hypothetical `k` matrix:

    syms Fx1 Fy1 Fx2 Fy2
    syms ux1 uy1 ux2 uy2
    k = [1 1 0 2; 0 1 0 0; 0.5 3 3 0.5; 0 0 0 1]
    
    k =
    
        1.0000    1.0000         0    2.0000
             0    1.0000         0         0
        0.5000    3.0000    3.0000    0.5000
             0         0         0    1.0000

Now put all the forces in a vector called `F` and all the displacements in a vector called `d`:

    F = [Fx1; Fy1; Fx2; Fy2]
     
    F =
     
     Fx1
     Fy1
     Fx2
     Fy2
     
    d = [ux1; uy1; ux2; uy2]
     
    d =
     
     ux1
     uy1
     ux2
     uy2

Now we can make your equation:

    yourEqn = F == k*d
     
    yourEqn =
     
                 Fx1 == ux1 + uy1 + 2*uy2
                               Fy1 == uy1
     Fx2 == ux1/2 + 3*ux2 + 3*uy1 + uy2/2
                               Fy2 == uy2

Okay cool. Now you need to **solve** that system of equations. So, **what are you trying to solve for**? You need to know either the forces or displacements. Let's assume you know all the *forces* and you need to solve for the *displacements*. This means you want all the equations to be in the form of `unn = ...`. Then you plug in the values you have for forces and get an answer:

    yourStruct = solve(yourEqn, d)
    
    yourStruct = 
    
      struct with fields:
    
        ux1: [1×1 sym]
        uy1: [1×1 sym]
        ux2: [1×1 sym]
        uy2: [1×1 sym]

Now you can get the solution to any of the displacements by `yourStruct.unn`, as in:

    yourStruct.ux1
     
    ans =
     
    Fx1 - Fy1 - 2*Fy2

You can see `ux1 = Fx1 - Fy1 - 2*Fy2`. Plug in the forces you know, and you're done. You can plug in forces easily **by not using syms in the first place** or by using the `subs()` command.  There are two ways to use `subs()` - you can use it on the struct that is the output of the `solve()` command, in which case you need to do it like:

    subs(yourStruct.ux1, Fx1, 100);

and you need to repeat that for each field in the struct, or you can just modify the equation before you solve. This updates everything in one call. **Replacing all the symbolic variables is easiest/best** unless you absolutely need the symbolic equations for some reason. Try:

    yourEqn = subs(yourEqn, Fx1, 100)
    yourStruct = solve(yourEqn, d)

Now all of your `unn` equations are updated.

Things would be easier if the xcorr vectors were X by 1 instead of 1 by X, so if you are able to change that, then this works:

    myMatrix = [t(:).xcorr];

However, you mentioned that the vectors are all different lengths, which won't work with matrices.  You can either pad the resulting vectors with trailing zeros (or some other value which can be used to indicate it's not a real data point - negative one is common if you expect positive values), or you can use cells (which won't care if your vectors are X by 1 or 1 by X):

    myCell = {myStruct(:).xcorr};

Cells do have their drawbacks, and may not be suitable depending on what you're doing.

jstaylor01,"If you are in that kind of class, you should be able to read up on matlab a bit. Plotting is pretty easy. But you will need to make values for your plot. (At least, I dont know how to do symbolic equations in matlab, never needed em personally). So this will mean for a basic 2d plot, that you fix all variables but one, and decide on your output, or dependent variable. You then need a range of input values. 

To keep it super simple, try a loop and increment x by some small amount each time. Store your output  in a vector. 

    
    
    for i=1:100
    x(i)=x(1)+.1*i
    y(i)=f[x(i)] (your math stuff makes out the function of f(x(i))

Now you could also do a 3d plot for some of those formulas and vary two of your variables. That would require, a double loop, and matrices to store your values, but the principle is the same. There should be plenty online that a quick search tells you how to plot that.

A few points:

1.  The biggest thing I can't figure out... what is `k` for? Let's say you're early in the process, and say `i = 1` and `j = 10`. Let's say `n = 100`. Your formula for k, `mod(1-10, 100)` gives `k = 91`. `k` continues to count *backwards* to zero. Later in the process, say `i = 10` and `j = 1`. Now you get `k = 9`, but again it's counting *backwards* and you'll *loop around zero* to `n-1` (99 in this example), and continue counting backwards. 
2.  Final point, you are doing this without any checks on the length of `h`. If `length(h)<length(x)`, you'll error out. If `length(h)>length(x)`, then you'll loop around a *portion* of `h` as described in point (1) above.

You might want to check if really all of the read 1x91 numbers are purely real. Let's say that you called the 1x91 matrix within Matlab ""A"". Use any(imag(A)) to see if any of the imaginary parts is non-equal to zero. If so, you probably want to have a look at your .csv file in the notepad to see where the irregularity might come from.

Extra bit: If I define a matrix as 

    A = [5+1e-12i, 2; 1, 1]

KevinRayJohnson,"Knowing when it may be easy vs when it will be hard to increase performance is the first thing I think of on this.  Things like going from dynamic resized to preallocated I don't worry about in prototyping because it's almost always trivial to ""fix"" that.

When I have to change the algorithm to use higher performance methods (EX: loops -> vectorized) I usually put the work into the prototype to vectorize from the start. Only don't bother if you have good reason to believe this is a tiny one-off or toy problem.  The habit to write the higher performance algorithm by default often saves development time in the long run because 

 * 1) Eventually you just get to where writing faster (ex vectorized) code is just the natural thing to do (it looks more like the underlying math too!).  You literally are forcing yourself to practice at becoming a better programmer by doing this.

 * 2) Ideally you save yourself a rewrite by not making the (slow algorithm -> fast algorithm) transformation on your source code.

 * 3) Things that are not broken don't get fixed.  People are amazing for sticking with the slow devil they know vs putting in the effort to rewrite code to get the better/faster/easier to debug/easier to reason about code

Finally, and I can't stress this enough, get in the habit of using the profiler early and often. Humans basically can't predict what parts of code are fast/slow without lots of time getting training to see the slow parts by the profiler. The profiler will also teach you a lot about what's going on under the hood that you would never have suspected otherwise.

TheQueq,"Even when I'm writing something quickly, I try to avoid the biggest slowdowns.  The more you practice this, the quicker it is in the future.  For me, the main things I try to remember for CPU speed include:

1. Vectorizing is much, much faster than a for loop (I have had precisely one exception to this);

2. Always preallocate variables before a loop if you can possibly know their final dimensions;

3. Structures of arrays are much, much faster than arrays of structures (i.e. `struct.field(:)` is better than `struct(:).field`

4. Calculate constants before entering loops whenever possible

Finally, note that the above tips assume that CPU time is your limiting factor.  If RAM usage is your limiting factor, then you will have to take a different approach that processes variables in manageable pieces - even if that processing takes more CPU time.

It looks like Matlab wants to multiply by 4/4 to get the 1/4 out of the denominator, wants to multiply by -1/-1 to get the coefficient of k^2 to be positive, and wants to pull out the pi in the denominator to get:

 -(1.273\*(-1.0)^k )/(4.0\*k^2 - 1.0)

Me too. I don't know what the problem is. 

> I can't figure out how to convert cell containing some text to string

If you have a cell array, like 

    myCell = {'This is a character array in a cell.'};

You can see that it's a cell by just typing the variable name:

    >>myCell
    
    myCell = 
    
      cell
    
        'This is a character array in a cell.'

If you want to get at the data *inside* the cell, you have to index it:

    >> myCell{1}
    
    ans =
    
        'This is a character array in a cell.'

If you want to convert that to a string, just wrap it in a `string` command:

    >> string(myCell{1})
    
    ans = 
    
        ""This is a character array in a cell.""

If you want to verify that it's a string, you can check with `isstring()`, as in:

    >> isstring(ans)
    
    ans =
    
      logical
    
       1

I'm not sure what's frustrating you about this. If you could post *helpful* things like some sample code that you're trying to process, the code you wrote to process it, the data you got out of the code, and the data you're expecting to get, then we could maybe help more. ",1515511669.0

hydra595,"My approach to this was always to rewrite these kind of differential equations slightly different. On one side of the equation, I wanted to have the highest order derivative. So for the first equation for instance x1'' and for the second equation x2''. 

Let's consider the first equation. Basically you have that the second derivative of something (x1) is equal to something else. You can implement DEs by making use of the integrator block. Since that equation contains a second derivative, you will need 2 integrator blocks in a row to integrate x1'' to x1. What you feed into the first integrator therefore has to be the second derivative.  Since the equation was rewritten as 

x1''=1/m1 * (...)

You basically have some kind of summation in the brackets that is multiplied by a gain of 1/m1. If that summation contains for instance x1', you simply say that x1' is what comes out of the first integrator. 

Since you have two coordinates (x1 and x2), this stuff is slightly more messy when building it. I suggest that you initially set up 2 sets of 2 integrators each. You use a GoTo block at the output of each integrator and label it accordingly (something like x1d, x1, x2d, x2) and then construct the just mentioned summation in front of either integrator pair.

userjjb,"This is about as short as you can get it and have it be reasonable (it works for arbitrary length *nums* and *standards* vectors):

    maxmult = floor(max(standards) ./ nums);
    
    perms = nums(1) * [0:maxmult(1)]';
    for i=2:length(nums)
        terms = permute(nums(i) * [0:maxmult(i)]', [2:i,1]);

    indices = cell2mat(temp)

For simplicity I tried to keep variables that did the same types of things be the same as your code.

I'll explain: *terms* is just the ith *nums* multiplied by all factors  up to *maxmult*. If your *nums* aren't all roughly the same magnitude, this can save a lot (it doesn't matter for *n=3* here, but for larger *n* it will).

*perms* is the running combination of all *terms* (we initialize it outside the loop for *i=1* to simplify index annoyance). The *permute()* is necessary so that we make the shape of terms be one dimension bigger than *perms* so that when we do *terms + perms* Matlab automatically does a [bsxfun()](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/bsxfun.html).

At this point we have computed all possible combinations; we compute the error, do some *cell()* hackery so that we can gracefully handle an arbitrary number of arguments from *ind2sub()*, and spit out the indices. Note that *indices* contains an extra column that contains the index of the *standards* that we found.

2PetitsVerres,"I have an implementation without any (visible) loop, that take advantage of the vectorized/matrix operations aspect of MATLAB. Also I use implicit expansion in two places (so you need MATLAB >= R2016b or change these two lines either with repmat or with bsxfun)

I haven't check the solution on your data, it seems to work on ""easier"" example (I didn't check the real solution on your data because I'm to lazy to write the end of the problem for you, where you still have to use the i indices to find the line tt(i,:) and use it to find the corresponding values in available_numbers)

Also this is only an exercise showing that you can do it without any loop. I don't think that's the best approach to solve it. The ""algorithm"" part in this case is brute force, and it does not scale well (the tt matrix is going to be 2\^(n\*m), n\*m in size (I think) with n = length(nums) and m = number of multipliers. It may be a non polynomial algorithm in general (It seems similar to the [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) which is NP-something IIRC but I haven't done theoretical algorithmic in a long time), but there must be more efficient algorithms than this one.

is about the least useful statement you can make. If it's not giving you an error, then *what makes you think it doesn't work*? What **is** it doing? If you can articulate what you are seeing and what you expected to see, odds are you might be able to troubleshoot the problem yourself - see [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging):

> Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a programming problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem. **In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent.**

Beyond that, if you can't explain to *us* what the problem is, then we're stuck *guessing* what the problem is and then coming up with answers to *hypothetical problems*!

**My shot in the dark:**

The first column of any matrix is... one column. It's one column wide. If you have a name that is, say, five characters wide, then each character resides in its own column. One row, five columns for something like 

    name = 'hello';

If you wanted to put this name in the first column of another matrix, you can't! You can't because `'hello'` is *five* columns wide. You can't put five columns into one column for a *matrix*. There are two workarounds for this:

1.  Convert your *character* array to a *string* array. Store the column of *strings* in the first column of your matrix. **This will cast everything in the matrix to strings.**
2.  Convert your matrix to a cell array. Store whatever you want in the first column of the cell array (a character array or a string array). You can't just do something like `output(:,1) = Names(:,1);` if `output` is a cell array though; you have to loop through row-by-row because you can't convert char or string to cell.

It's not clear if `NAMES` is a char array or a string array. It's not clear if `output` is a matrix or a cell array. It's not clear what the problem you're seeing is. If you make `output` first as a character array, then add numeric data to it, the numbers will be cast to characters by ASCII code. If you first make it as a number matrix and add characters, the characters will be cast to integers, again by ASCII code.

Split how? Graphically split? Split some other way?

Depends on what you want to do. I would point out that drawing a picture (plotting) and doing math (solving equations of motion) are two totally separate concepts that don't have anything to do with each other beyond the fact that they might both use some position data.

> I hope I've explained what I need help on clearly enough.

You have not. You have [data] that you want to [do stuff with]. You have not posted data, you have not posted equations, you have not posted your attempt to write the equations in Matlab, and you haven't really explained the actual problem you're trying to solve, either. You simply said,

> My main problem is I don't know how to apply the equations of motion to the 'car' along each segment of the track.

What equations of motion? What 'car'? Are you trying to solve equations of motion or are you trying to solve for forces? I think this might actually be your biggest problem. *Define what it is you're trying to do. Have a plan.* I would guess you're *actually* trying to solve for forces, in which case you would want a linear/tangential force of `F = ma` and a centripetal force of `F = (m*v^2)/r`. 

> based on reading other literature, it seems that the common method is to pick two points with the smallest radius

I think you're misunderstanding here. Points are points. They don't have a radius. I think the ""literature"" is referring to how to find a segment, given a bunch of points, in which case the succeeding point would be the point that has the shortest distance to the current point. The easier way to do this is to just have all the points in an array, which it seems like you do already. 

> it seems that the common method is to pick two points with the smallest radius, as that defines the apex of two corners connected by a straight,

Two points make a line, not a curve. They're not corners, they're just points. 

> you then work out the acceleration based on solving the equations of motion starting from one apex to the other,

Again, I think you're confused as to what you're solving. In order to ""solve equations of motion"" or find accelerations from two points in space, you need something more. You have to have a drive cycle, or a target speed, or something. You could traverse two points at 1 mile per hour or 100, or 200, etc. There's nothing to solve with just two points. 

>  and then go the other way to work out the maximum speed the car can take that corner, and therefore workout the point along the straight in which the car has to brake.

Again, I think this is all depending on some kind of a drive cycle. At a minimum, if you're trying to determine the speed at which a car can corner, you need to take *three* points, find the radius of curvature that fits those *three* points, then max tire friction force, then the peak centripetal acceleration (again: `(m*v^2)/r`) given the tire force, etc. I think that's what you're trying to solve. 

> Again, I can do it fairly easily on paper, but I'm not sure how to implement this in Matlab.

Again, make a plan. Do the first 5 or 10 points on paper, by hand. Then try just copying and pasting it exactly into Matlab. Verify your hand results. Look for the pattern, probably something like `F(i) = F(i-1) + <stuff>;` and then code the loop.",1513703175.0
lou_profile,"I am currently developing a Quasi-Steady-State lap time simulator as part of my Master Thesis. I have worked with Formula Student and currently am working in a LMP3 manufacturer where I validated my simulator.

> assuming constant velocity while cornering, and therefore tangential acceleration will be zero

Be careful with this. Steady-state is the condition the car is behaving when at the appex but this is not the case for QUASI-Steady-State and turn-entry and turn-exit. In PURE steady-state there is only lateral acceleration, right! Altough, the QUASI brings a new way to simulate: you say the car has longitudinal (Ax) AND lateral (Ay) acceleration at the same time.

To know how you can have Ay and Ax at the same time is all about the tyres friction circle or the GG diagram. GG diagrams are function of the tyres and the velocity the vehicle is describing in a certain point. This is explained in any VD important book.

Concerning the way to describe the track. The trajectory is an input to the Lap Time Simulator calculations. You say you already have real trajectory data so you can use it (each sample data is a segment) if you know the radius of curvature in each segment. What you have to do is: know the maximum possible velocity in each segment (maxCorVel) and then the velocity will be:

    vel(i) = min(maxCorVel, vel(i-1) + Ax(i-1) + Deltatime(i-1))

where Deltatime(i-1) is the amount of time expended travelling the previous segment. Then the Ax(i) and Ay(i) will be function of v(i) through all the VD equations you already know on paper.

Remember, in QUASI-SS the tangencial accelerations are not necessarily zero! In order to change the value of velocity from one segment to the next, there must be tangencial acceleration (non-uniform circular motion).

If you want to know more details in calculating the Ax and Ay in each segment please ask. I can also send you ""state of the art"" on the subject. Don't worry about matlab, it's very straight forward to use. My simulation is done in a single script with only 2 extra functions.",1513708587.0

>to see how I could improve on it, 

Your code seems generally fine, but i do have some remarks; matlab (ML means machine learning to me) index starts 1, which is usually applied to anything for sake of consistency.

    psi(3,4)

would give you the entry from the 3rd row and 4th column of psi. But indexing in Matlab is more flexible, and can be used to extract whole blocks of entries from a matrix; you needn't extract them one at a time.

The code you've quoted uses two kinds of 'fancy' indexing. Firstly, instead of '3' we've got ':', which means that instead of asking for the 3rd row, you're asking for every row.

Secondly, instead of '4' we've got '2:2:2*n_mesh'. This is potentially confusing in itself, but you may have seen that, e.g., 

    100:10:200

produces the array

    [100   110   120   130   140   150   160   170   180   190   200]

Thus if n_mesh is, for instance, 5, then 2:2:2*n_mesh is 2:2:10, i.e.,

Alternatively to the brute force solution, you can try to optimize this by instead of operating only on one element at a time, only index those which you need, e.g something along the lines of:

    angle(angle >= 360) = angle(angle >= 360) - 360;

and your while loop condition could look something like:

shtpst,"You're passing a vector to the `while` loop check. The expression `angle >= 360` returns `false` for each entry where `angle < 360` and true everywhere else. 

The first value of `angle >= 360` happens to be `false`, so the `while` loop sees `while false` and quits without doing anything.

Further, inside your loop, you subtract 360 from **all** of the entries in `angle`, not just the ones that are greater than 360. 

I'll give you your steps in plain English, then show you how that gets ""translated"" to Matlab:

1.  While any angle values are greater than or equal to 360,
2.  Find all of the values that are greater than or equal to 360, and then
3.  Subtract 360 from those values.

The key in the first line is `any()`: 

1.  `while any(angle>360)`

Then do an implicit `find` with conditional indexing:

2\.  `angle(angle>=360) = `

The statement above finds `angle` where `angle >= 360`. This is selecting those values to **update** them, as evidenced by the `=` sign after. Finally,

3\.  `angle(angle>=360) - 360;`

This again finds `angle` where `angle >= 360`, but this time uses them in a calculation - it takes all `angle` where `angle >= 360` and subtracts 360 from those entries.

~~A more laborious option is to use [regexp](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/regexp.html) to parse the full 'path\filename.ext' string and collect the characters after the last '\' and until the end of the string.  If you need help learning how to work with regular expressions, here is [a fun and informative sandbox](https://regex101.com/).~~

~~An even more labor and clock cycle-intensive solution is to loop over the characters in the string from end to '\' and store them, then reverse the order.  You could start from the front, but it'd take longer, unless the file name is longer than the path.~~

I can't recommend uigetfile enough for this task.

Idiot__Engineer,"For non-uniform points this sounds sort of like a traveling salesman problem. Maybe embedded in a really high dimensional space or something like that. That's probably stupid, it's late and I'm not thinking hard about it. But I it's similar enough in principle that I doubt it's tractable in the general case. I could see there being options for the evenly spaced case, though.

Instead of sliding a 2N row down the first dimension, I would slide the widest row you can fit in memory. So you start by loading 2N x M (M > 2N) of the plane into memory and slide along the second dimension. When you hit the end of the row (M), then you start sliding ""down"" the first (2N) dimension, but you go back to the start of the 2nd dimension. Basically you do the same type of rastering you imagine over the whole plane, but just within a smaller section that you *can* fit into memory. You'll throw out the points that were at the ""top"" and load new points at the ""bottom"", just like in your example. You never have redundant reads from sliding along the first dimension. Then when you've slid all the way to the end of the first dimension, you go back up to the top and move over by M. You still have redundant loads at the interface between the two M-wide rows, but at least you've minimized the number of such interfaces based on the memory constraints.

Edit: Jesus I can't explain this well without pictures. You have a 10x10 plane where the window you want to slide is 1x1. You can load 5 such windows into memory. Start like this (`[]` shows you what is in memory, `x` is what you're looking at/evaluating):

    [x . . . .]. . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .

Slide along the 2nd dimension:

    [. . x . .]. . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .

Everything in this block is in memory, so no extra reads. Hit the end:

    [. . . . x]. . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .

Now move down along the first dimension:

     . . . . . . . . . .
    [x . . . .]. . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .

and repeat from there.

Because my example is coarse, it's not immediately obvious that you're saving memory accesses here. But you'll slide less than a full window width, throwing out the points at the top that are no longer in your window and adding new points at the bottom. You never have to read something that you've read in before when you're going down the column. 

When you hit the bottom:

     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
    [. . . . x]. . . . .

you move over one row and repeat the entire process, just like your example:

     . . . . .[x . . . .]
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . . . . . .
 
Again, my example is too coarse to properly convey this, but you're going to have an interface along the ""seam"" between the 5-wide columns where you're reloading stuff that's already been in memory. But instead of having it on *every* column, you only have it every 5. If you maximize 5 according to what can fit in memory, I bet that gets close to minimizing what data gets read from memory twice. I can think of a scheme to stretch it so that the entire width of the column doesn't actually fit in memory to do even slightly better, but it's not worth the added complexity.

Basically you're just rastering in 2 stages instead of one. The inner stage just covers the biggest portion of the plane you can without do *any* redundant reads. Then you move onto the next portion of the plane and live with the redundant reads at the interface between the two.",1513483259.0

Essentially you have a defined set of coordinates in three dimensions - equally spaced in two of them I assume ?

If you were to construct a two-dimensional grid using your two fixed dimensions, and store the elevation for each of these cells you are half way there.

For a given point in your grid, there is a defined number of neighbouring points. Unless you are at a corner or an edge, this number is equal to 8. Using the index of the original points, calculate the corresponding 8 vectors, pick the largest and you have your next point on your path.

Hitting an edge or corner - first or last cell in the grid in one or both dimensions - provides you with a termination condition.

    x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    y = [1, 2; 3, 4];

See how it's a little hard to notice that `x` is a 1x4 row vector but `y` is a 2x2 matrix? When I define matrices or column vectors, I do so as follows:

    x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    y = [...

Now it's clear that `y` is a 2x2 matrix. Not super useful up front, but it makes it clear at a glance what the intent is, and I would argue that readability and clearly expressing intent is vastly more important than writing compact code.

For this specific excerpt, storing the repmat call to a variable (such as Y) would be good considering that it's being used twice, so you might as well define it once. This brings us to (X-Y)*(X-Y)./(n-1). At that point you should be able consolidate to (X-Y)^2 ./(n-1), and the Y variable would be good for debugging but likely not useful. Given dimension expansion in newer versions the repmat is actually redundant to and you can simply put (X-mean(X)) and work with that instead!

shtpst,"The easiest way to do this is without a `for` loop at all. Ask yourself what you want - 

> ""I want `a` to be equal to `x`, whenever `mod(x,2)` is zero.""

That translates to:

    a = x(mod(x,2) == 0);

This is called [logical indexing](https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2013/02/20/logical-indexing-multiple-conditions/). Here's what happens:

    mod(x,2) == 0

The statement above returns a `false` everywhere `mod(x, 2)` does not equal zero, and it returns a `true` everywhere it does equal zero. That is, `mod(x, 2) == 0`, as a statement, returns a logical array of false and true values. 

You can use that array to ""pick"" values from a matrix or vector - Matlab assumes that, when you pass in a logical array as an index, you want to keep all the values where the indexing values are true. 

So, you can do the whole thing in a compact two lines:

    a = x(mod(x, 2) == 0);
    b = x(mod(x, 2) ~= 0);

And sidestep the loop entirely. I am not a fan of writing code that way though, and would prefer to be slightly more verbose such that the intent of my code is more clear. For example, I personally would write the following:

    evenValues = mod(x, 2) == 0;
    a = x(evenValues);
    b = x(~evenValues);

For this much code, it probably doesn't look like much of a difference, but I generally try to avoid using functions as inputs or indexing parameters if I have to write it out more than once. This for two reasons - first, I think it's really easy to overlook flaws in the function call, especially if you're changing parameters in each call, and second, if my code is going to fail, I want it to fail BIG so I can find the mistake quickly. By defining `evenValues`, if I got the definition wrong, then `a` **and** `b` should be garbage and that would definitely point back to a flaw in generating those values. If I don't use `evenValues` (or similar) then `a` might be correct and `b` would be flawed, or vice-versa, and then you get ""intermittent"" errors downstream where sometimes you get the right answers and sometimes not, depending on whether you're using the correctly or incorrectly defined values.

This will also require you to calculate a separate value for `z`, presumably `sz` from your naming convention.  Note that `sz` is not guaranteed - or even expected - to reach zero at the same time as `z`, so you will probably want to use a separate while loop for the zero drag case (alternatively, you could use a second while loop to continue the zero drag case - or you could use a single loop then truncate the results for the drag case when plotting).

In my experience, the biggest speedups tend to from fixing any 'stupid' errors, like ""not preallocating a huge array that you fill in with a loop"", and from vectorizing the code (preferably with matrix operations, though bsxfun can be helpful as well).

Weed_O_Whirler,"OK, this is a multi-step process, but one that will make your life so much better in the long run. First, know that `plot` can be called with 2 inputs, `plot(x,y)`. In your case, you want to make `x` your time and `y` your temp. So, if you have one measurement of temp every second, you could say `t = 1:3.5E4` and then you'd have a time vector. 

Now, if you plot this as `plot(t, temp)` it would still look the same, so you might think this hasn't helped you at all. But now that we have a time vector, we can have some fun. 

MATLAB has a unit type called a [duration](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/duration.html). Since your time is in seconds, the duration type you want is [seconds](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/seconds.html). So, you can make a new variable of type `seconds` by saying `t_dur = seconds(t)`.

Now, since `t_dur` is a duration, you can set properties. Specifically, you can set a `Format` property. To get your data in `HH:MM:SS` you can say `t_dur.Format = 'HH:MM:SS'`.

Now, if you say `plot(t_dur, temp)` you'll get your x axis labeled in HH:MM:SS. This is better than manually setting tick-marks, because it will auto-resize if you zoom in and out. ",1512750654.0

So I have a few general tips first -- the error that matlab gives will display the function called and the line number, just from this you should be able to find the offending line. Secondly check out the keyboard command, it's quite useful for drilling inside of functions to see what is going on.

Now, from looking at your code it seems that what your function does is take an input that is the size of the output matrix and a random seed, it then calculates the random number from the modulus of this seed plus some other numbers. The first point of confusion for me is that from the way you've written the code it seems that you want every element of your output to be different, but the way the code actually works makes them all the same. The way to fix this problem really depends on which one you want.

The problem areas:

* You don't need a conditional around the abs, just use the abs as it is

* Your while loop basically does nothing at all

* A new assignment of a variable will overwrite the previous contents, you do this several times

* Because of these problems the for loop after crashes

     M(1:end-1,:) < M(2:end,:)

Doing this similair stuff with other neighbours and combining the result is to me the most straight forward way to find your local minima. 

A more complicated but imho cooler (because convolutions are cool) is to convolve your matrix with [-1 1] and [-1;1], and use the sign of the results to determine wether you have local minima

    conv2(M,[-1 1],'same')

You only need two convolutions, because checking wether a value smaller than its neighbour is the same as checking wether the neighbour is smaller than the value, with only a sign change and an index offset. 
The difficulty with both these methods is making sure the indices allign, since you cant compare the first element of the matrix with it's upper neighbour (since it doesn't have one.).

The findpeaks method proposed maybe works, but the findpeaks method i know only works in 1 dimension, and is overkill if you only want to compare vlaues to their immediate neighbours. By overkill i mean that it does a whole bunch more computations (see the [examples](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/findpeaks.html)) than just local comparisons.

    end
    v_inc=sum(dv(dv>0));
    v_dec=sum(dv(dv<0));

The above is for reference, though theres a much more efficient way of doing this (assuming you want v_1 to keep its value of 14.67 every time v_2 is calculated and dont want to update it with the previous v_2. This is what is what your code currently does I believe, though I could imagine you might want to update v_1 at the start of each loop). Assuming you wanted to get all possible combinations of h_1 and h_2 for h1=[6:100] and h2=h1+1, you could do:

    m_s = 0.5; %Coefficient of friction 
    m = 50; %Mass of Cart 
    g = 32.2; %Acceleration due to gravity ft/s2

    h_1 = [6:100]';    % 1st dimension is h_1
    h_2 = (h_1+1)';    % 2nd dimension is h_2
    v_1 = 14.67;       % note: your code is set up so this is the same in ALL loops. if you had intended to update v_1 with the previous loop's v_2 the code below wint work.
    %L=[5:100];        % Not needed?

     % calculate v_2 with a single vectorized operation
    v_2 = sqrt( ( (m.*v_1.^2) + 2*bsxfun(@minus,(m*g).*h_1,(m*g).*h_2) ) ./ m);

    % to make negative velocities be negative instead of imaginary
    v_2(imag(v_2)~=0)=-imag(v_2(imag(v_2)~=0));

edit: if you only care for the immediate case where h2=h1+1, remove the ""bsxfun(...)"" and just use ""(m * g) .* h_1 - (m * g) .* h_2)"" instead. Also, remove the ( ' ) from the end of the definition for h_2 (so that it reads ""h_2 = (h_1 + 1);""). Note that this only requires a 1-D vector of data, not a 2-D array.",1512338365.0
jkool702,"I feel like this is entirely dependent on what type of custom operations you want to do. In the example you have, im pretty sure you can just convolve the kernal with a matrix of ones that is the size of M (using the standard conv2 operation) and then add that to M (assuming you want a convolution-type operation, but you dont actually want the values of M to effect what you get. Assuming size(M) > size(kernal), this will take into account edge effects of the convolution and will always add the same amount to the middle).

If you care about efficiency Id really try to stick with the conv2 function, as its probably much more optimized than anything you can write in matlab. It seems like you could pobably break down most add/subtract/times/divide down into a convolution (possibly with one of the inputs inverted on a element-by-element basis) and possibly a 2nd convolution with a matrix of ones and/or a matrix addition/subtraction. Even for more complex operations, as long as you want a convolution-type of operation I think (for many, though not all, operation) you should be able to first apply the operation to the matrix M on a term-by-term basis (and maybe store as a new matrix), then convolve the kernal wit that matrix. 

ex:

    % M(m,n) = sum of 2^M(i,j) for i = m + [-1 0 1] and j = n  + [-1 0 1]

    kernal=ones(3,3);
    M2=2.^M;
    M2=conv2(M2,kernal,'shape desired')

if instead of summing ""2^(M[i,j])"" you wanted ""kernal(m,n))^(M[i,j])"" this doesnt work, though its not worth speculating on this type of thing without knowing the operations you actually will need to do.

If you did really want to do something like you are proposing though, I think it might be possible to do using [arrayfun](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/arrayfun.html). though im not 100% sure as I havent used that particular function much. If you have the right toolbox, [convmtx2](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/convmtx2.html?s_tid=doc_ta) might also be useful, as you can get the convolution matrix, modify it as needed, then apply it (potentially multiple times) using matrix multiplication.

set a debugging point near the top and follow the inputs.

Why do you use 'n' as an input and as a for loop counter?  If you must, clear n; after setting it to degree or replace 'n' in the function input with 'degree'.

you are also using defining FS as a scaler after the first for loop and changing it in the second for loop.

 How big is FS? should the second for loop have an FS(n) or are you trying to make and change a scaler?

jkool702,"Im pretty sure the issue is how your using the anonymous functions (newfunctionSin and newfunctionCos and FS). These should only be defined ONCE. This means they need to be defined outside the loop, and then called inside the loop. 

Also, tI would break FS into a new function at each step. Matlab might not like updating it in that way. You can do this using a cell array. Heres an example that should hopefully make it clear.

    Nmax=6;   % change this as needed
    f=cell(Nmax+1,1);

    f{1}=@(x)(x+10);
    for nn=2:Nmax
        f{nn}=@(x)(f{nn-1}(x+10*nn)+5*nn^2-10);
    end

    % add function to final cell to select degree to use (f will contain all degrees between 1 and Nmax)
    ff=@(x,nn)(f{nn}(x));
    f{end}=ff;

    % test

    for nn=1:Nmax
        fprintf('The function from iteration %i produces %.2f for an input of %.2f \n',nn,f{end}(inTest,nn),inTest)
    end

Note: you need to save the entire cell, since matlab doesnt seem to automatically substitute one function into the next one, even though it seems somewhat trivial in your case. Maybe someone else knows how to do that. If not, you can make it work but need to call it using ""f{end}(x,nn)"" rather than ""f(x,n)"". It might be useful though if you dont always want/need the same degree fourier series, as this would inherently give you access to all degrees between 1 and Nmax.
