sandoze,"How big of a project? How long does it take to run tests? How many developers on the project? How many clients are you distributing to?

My answer to these questions (generally) over the last few projects have been: average size and complexity, under 5 minutes, 1-4, more than 10 and less than 100. 

So my solution for the past few years has been Fastlane. I have a Fastlane script (and a series of lanes) that, doesn’t necessarily run all of these things in this order but runs tests, pushes to Hockey (or Test Flight), marks a build as pass/fail in github, updates podspecs, pushes to a pod repo. Etc. All with one command via the terminal, or as post scripting in a Xcode scheme. 

Typical CI workflow using above: github requires a passing build is toggled in the repo settings. Branch is pushed up and PR is created. In terminal I run the pull request lane. That builds the project, ensures there are no pending changes to push, runs tests (on multiple schemes if I were building an SDK), checks for failures and warning (strict no warning policy) and marks the build via a github API as pass/fail. After that the PR is ready for review or merge. 

Every developer runs this lane when doing a pull request. Merge cannot happen without a passing build. I prefer this approach because it’s local, easy to move from project to project, results are pretty quick and failures can be addressed before the developer switches context and it doesn’t need to rely on third party platforms that may not be transparent or cost money.

Most Collections Are Objects

Although it’s possible to use a C array to hold a collection of scalar values, or even object pointers, most collections in Objective-C code are instances of one of the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch collection classes, like NSArray, NSSet and NSDictionary.

These classes are used to manage groups of objects, which means any item you wish to add to a collection must be an instance of an Objective-C class. If you need to add a scalar value, you must first create a suitable NSNumber or NSValue instance to represent it.

Rather than somehow maintaining a separate copy of each collected object, the collection classes use strong references to keep track of their contents. This means that any object that you add to a collection will be kept alive at least as long as the collection is kept alive, as described in Manage the Object Graph through Ownership and Responsibility.

In addition to keeping track of their contents, each of the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch collection classes make it easy to perform certain tasks, such as enumeration, accessing specific items, or finding out whether a particular object is part of the collection.

The basic NSArray, NSSet and NSDictionary classes are immutable, which means their contents are set at creation. Each also has a mutable subclass to allow you to add or remove objects at will.

For more information on the different collection classes available in Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, see Collections Programming Topics.

https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Collections/Collections.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000034i

#In Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, a collection is a Foundation framework class used for storing and managing groups of objects. Its primary role is to store objects in the form of either an array, a dictionary, or a set.

ShottyMcKeith,">constraintLayout which is similar to autoLayout(however it provides a lot more features)

I'm not sure I would agree with that. AutoLayout is incredibly flexible and powerful, but it does have a learning curve and there are configurations that are difficult or impossible to achieve solely through the interface builder tools. But that's not a limitation of the AutoLayout engine itself.

AutoLayout supports ratios by way of a [constraint's multiplier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/nslayoutconstraint/1526920-multiplier), which allows you to express, for example, that View A should 10% as tall as View B. But the multiplier has to be set in the constraint's initializer and can be hard to define in IB.

>is it a good practice to heavily utilize **percents and filling screen with them**?

It's neither good or bad - it depends on the requirements of the design. Using a lot of relative constraints does make the constraint setup more complex, however. Your life will be easier if you avoid doing so.

 - This particular API is ""designed for Swift"", but OB overall is available for Java/Go/C/etc.
 - In some places they call it ""ObjectBox for iOS"", or ""a free mobile database"", or ""a database for Mobile and IoT"".  It looks like desktop use is not a major concern.
 - Maybe I'm blind, but I can't seem to find the source code for the database.  It looks like this Swift library is a thin wrapper around something, and the something seems like a binary blob that isn't published anywhere.  I guess only part of the language wrappers are Apache licensed?
 - They really love code generation.  You need a ""Sourcery"" build step for Swift.  The C library uses a lot of macros, too.  I've never used OB yet, obviously, but I haven't seen that approach work very well on other projects.
 - Their docs are ... brief.  Strangely, they have a section called ""Relations"" which doesn't appear to have much to do with how an RDBMS uses relations (it's more like foreign keys).  The terminology shift could be confusing.
 - Sorting isn't implemented.  There's no mention of indexing, or case sensitivity, or partial fetches, or size limits, or any other non-trivial questions I have.  The version number is no exaggeration: this is the least mature database I've ever seen.
 - They brag it's ""10x"" faster than SQLite.  That's not surprising, since it does so much less.  Their benchmarks basically just fetch a bunch of objects, and then read every field in them.  They obviously don't benchmark any of the parts of OB that aren't written yet.  Will you ever want to sort your data, or query on an indexed field?  Then these benchmarks are useless to you.

The webpage is very pretty.  This looks like a project that was optimized for making 20 lines of code look great.  I would not want to work on a program that used this database.  It's much less functional than even SQLite.  When something goes wrong, instead of reading the source code or searching 50,000 questions on StackOverflow, you're stuck paying them.

Data persistence isn't an area where I want to cut corners on features, or go with a no-name technology because it makes a few lines of code look pretty.  I'd love a *good* object database, but this looks more like MongoDB (never again!) than PostgreSQL (which has never lost a single byte of my data).",1543519653.0

ZeOranges,"Use multiple child view controllers with their own container for a screen makes code pretty easy to understand. For example, a social media app can have one screen that displays a user's profile, post history, settings, etc. You'd end up with an MVC (massive view controller) if you tried containing it all in one view controller.

lucasvandongen,"I typically do not use more than one ViewController even if there are clearly discernible tasks in one screen like a game that has a chat screen below it. The reason is that the ViewController is about lifecycle management and sometimes (for example in case of the NavigationController) managing the lifecycles of other ViewControllers.

Nowadays I would split up the game/chat example in a GameViewModel and ChatViewModel since they have a very different purpose and update rate and only use one GameViewController because Game and Chat have the same View lifecycle (appear and disappear at the same moment etcetera).

The ViewModels would be bound to a View not ViewController. So in this case the GameViewController would have a BaseGameView as its principal view, with a GameView and ChatView as children and those two Views would be bound in any way you like to to their respective ViewModels.

Those Views should be slightly fat but not more than 200 lines usually.

So apart from Tab- and NavigationControllers and maybe a RootViewController there should be no other ViewController per screen. The only thing I might do differently is when I have this typical global sliding menu, I usually put that in a container view in the root view controller.

On iPad programs you might compose a screen of multiple view controllers as for example you would have a list / detail combination in one screen.",1543344826.0
davbeck,"I can't speak to Android development, but for basic apps you wouldn't use child view controllers. Using system provided view controllers like navigation controller, tab bar controller and page view controller, you can push and move between multiple view controllers. For many, if not most apps, one of those will be your root view controller (it's pretty rare for your root view controller to change). Those view controllers are managing child view controllers for you, where your view controllers are siblings inside of those.

&#x200B;

Using custom view controller containment hasn't been historically popular. You won't see very many tutorials using that. Instead they will create a custom view, or just have a single view controller handling the entire screen. Part of that is because it use to be pretty hard to embed a view controller yourself, and before that it was impossible. However it is a pattern that Apple recommends and can be very useful.

BlasphemousJoshua,"I'm having problems too.
Since you're on the Swift subreddit, I'm guessing you're trying to write it in Swift?

I've tried using this [Swift Automator Action Xcode Template](https://macosxautomation.com/automator/xcode-swift-template/index.html) to no avail. This ensures the Swift dynamic libraries are good to go in the build settings. I can compile the action and add it to Automator's library of actions. However, when I try to add it to a workflow I get ""The action MyAction could not be loaded because its executable is not loadable. Try reinstalling the action.""

If I run Automator from the command line I get something more specific: ""dyld: warning, LC_RPATH @executable_path/../Frameworks in /Users/joshua/Library/Automator/SwiftAction2.action/Contents/MacOS/SwiftAction2 being ignored in restricted program because of @executable_path"".

The only dynamic libraries it's loading from it's bundle are the various ""libswiftCore*.dylib"". Swift bundles this into each executable target it makes (presumably this changes with ABI stability in 5.0 when it can be bundled in OS X's System folder). Automator will not allow dynamic libraries to be loaded from an ""@executable_path""; some kind of security restriction.

And that's where I'm stuck. Any help or information would be great.",1543134162.0

confu2000,"Singletons aren’t inherently bad, but they make it easy to force dependencies between components.

If you call your singleton directly from your controller then you’ve forced a dependency in the controller.

Say you wanted to write a test for your controller but didn’t want to actually make a network call because it talks to your production server. If the controller calls the singleton directly then you’d need to add some kind of testing logic to the network code itself.

The way to correct this is to use dependency injection (DI). Instead of calling the singleton directly, you pass an instance to your controller as part of the init. In your app, you can still pass the singleton instance during initialization but the controller itself only cares about the instance that it was given and so the dependency is broken. 

In this scenario, if you wanted to test the controller, you could write a fake/mock/alternate network implementation and pass that during init. 

This concept has benefits beyond just testing. DI gives you flexibility as requirements change because your controllers and other components can be reused more easily with behavior changing based on what you’re passing at init.

Lastly, there’s a related topic called protocol orientated programming that also ties in well with DI and testing, but that’s getting a bit too far away. ",1543070990.0

spinwizard69,"The command line is extremely useful, especially if you develop a lot of utilities and one offs to get a job done.  I’ve written many Python CLU (command Line Utilities) over the years to get quick jobs done.  So from that perspective the command line utility is perhaps the fastest way to processa chunk of data.  By the way Swift is quickly becoming a language that could replace Python.  

Beyond that I really think it is a good idea to learn to develop an entire program using command line tools.   This would help many better understand what is happening under the hood of an IDE.   I’m not sure if I would call Swift ready for this.   The ideal language here would be C++ mainly due to streams.  It isn’t a question of going deep into the process but rather just build and link a simple C++ program that exposes the basic build process and handling file I/O. One or two such CLU under your belt and you should have a better understanding of what an IDE or make file are doing.    So yeah understanding the CLI is very important to being a well rounded programmer.  

The third thing here is that there are a huge number of command line apps out there that can make anybodies life easier not just a programmers.  Ive used such software to extract data from PDF files, download YouTube videos, and a host of other activities.

It’s not as intimidating as you think!

I can answer, I spend the majority of my time in IDEs with a 2018 13"".

The Touch Bar out-of-the-box is bad. Having controls that constantly move and change, in an area that's normally (visually) blocked by your hands, is a UX nightmare.

The Touch Bar with BetterTouchTool is 50% better, and 50% worse, than no function keys. Seek out articles like this one: [https://vas3k.com/blog/touchbar/](https://vas3k.com/blog/touchbar/)

My customized Touch Bar has:

* 5 static buttons for my most-used apps I can hit without looking \[Slack, IDE, Safari, Terminal, Spotify\]
* Battery Time Remaining (percentage is in menu bar)
* Weather
* Volume Slider
* Currently Playing button (tapping pauses/plays, and press+hold takes me to whatever application is playing)

When I need to access the debugger (I will never not have Step/Continue buttons mapped to F5-F8 in my brain) I just switch back to the function keys via a special button that shows up on the Touch Bar when I'm holding Option.

It's fine, it doesn't affect negatively in any way. MacOS doesn't use the F keys anyway (not like Windows and Linux), we use combinations of the command key.

It's true that while you program, you can do anything you couldn't do without shortcut keys? Yes it is, but it's damn fine to have those buttons there, for example the back/forward button is much easier to use than the shortcut keys.

And the escape key is also fine, if you tap somewhere a little off, it registers the key as the touch target is bigger than the physical aspect.

ShottyMcKeith,">I don't want to have to say

Why? Seriously, why is `nodes[i]` better than `units[i].node`? Hiding the top level array access behind a computed property obfuscates what is actually going on for a small syntactic change. There is benefit to hiding complexity in your code but I'd argue in this case that you're doing the opposite - you're making it *more* complex and harder to understand and reason about. Unless, of course, you frequently need an array of Nodes to operate on but for individual accesses it just doesn't make sense. I'd be willing to bet that some future person reading your code will ask ""Huh?"" when they see that.

And there are potentially performance considerations. You would be creating a whole new Array object (and incurring the performance hit of running map on N Units) constantly, even to access a single Node. Depending on your usage pattern that could really add up.

A more performant pattern, but no less baffling, would be to use a function:

`func node(_ at: Int) -> Node { return units[i].node }`

Then you could just call it with `node(i)`.",1542672008.0

eugeniu,"There was a good episode about this topic on Under the Radar a while back. I can't find the link, but they were talking about what they do to build online services for their iOS apps. They basically recommend sticking to the big frameworks for building server-side applications, like Rails and Express. I dabble in server-side Swift, and it's a lot of fun. But it's sparsely charted territory. A lot of features you expect in server-side frameworks haven't yet been implemented in frameworks like Vapor, or the implementations are preliminary. And the Swift language is still rapidly evolving, as are the frameworks. On the other hand, frameworks like Rails are very stable, and pretty much any problem you could possibly have has been experienced by someone else and solved by someone else. 

So in the end, it kind of depends on what you want to do. If you need to build a server-side app that is reliable and takes the least amount of time to build, go with an established framework. If you want to explore things, get the advantages of Swift, and be part of something new, go with server-side Swift.",1542671532.0
spinwizard69,"The first question that comes to mind is do you really need server side support for your apps?   Here is the thing, many apps these days require server side support and frankly that sucks.  They waste my bandwidth and cause other grief.  So that question often pops up in my mind, why does this app waste my bandwidth.  That question has actually caused me to delete apps.  

In any event back to the question at hand, can you build server apps with Swift.  The answer is certainly but that leaves oh the details.  First the franeworks like Vapor Kitura and others are at best beta quality pre version one releases in my mind anyways.  To put it simply they are not all there yet.  That shouldn’t stop you though as everyf ramework in existence went through these phases of development.  

The other big problem isSwift itself which still isn’t stable.  UTF8 support is scheduled for Swift 5 as is ABI stability.  I would expect Swift 5 to bring a bunch of rewriting of the web frameworks to better support the new strings in Swift 5.  Once Swift5 arrives and the intitial design changes digested we should see rapid development of Swift frameworks.  

One needs to remember that eve though we are at the Swift 4.2 release level this is still very much beta software.  I’m ducking right now to avoid the arrows but let’s face it Swift has changed dramatically with each release.  Swift 5 would slow that down completely.    A stable binary interface is key to allowing platforms built upon Swift to move forward.  

So if your software is flexible with deployment timeframes I’d suggest finding Swift 5 betas to start to learn the last of the new features. About mid 2019 Swift 5 should be stable and some time after that frameworks should be requiring Swift 5.   I guessing Swift 5 will be ready by or close to Apples WWDC in 2019.  A year ago I might have delivered a different answer but at this point I don’t see the point in writing web software for old Swift when new Swift with new strings is so close.  ",1542697105.0

surfbeach,"Let’s start from beginning:

First Stage:
Several couple medium small projects: 
$40 - $60 per hour just to get the contract and use it as reference. 
Also you get to speed with some things while doing these things. 

Second Stage:
After first couple projects: you are realizing that you have to make graphics and code and debug and be QA for the whole project and client starts changing things in the middle of project that might require rewriting portion of code. 
$85 - $120 per hour. 

Third Stage: 
You already have good references and portfolio. Familiar with some popular third party libs. Opportunity to hire/subcontract backend guys to speed things up. 
$150 - and up. 

Another option is per whole project basis ( risky, but some clients like it better. ) you will need experience and confidence to quote $20,000 or $50.,000, etc for building custom project. 

You will need to have contract spell out everything out. 

I would recommend build it in stages and get paid for each stage finished. This way you minimize your risks. 

Some good freelancers could explain even more.

You have to be very strong, business wise and also financially stable if no projects for several months or client(s) does not pay. 
Have multiple projects in pipe always helps. Everybody dreams about that. ",1542664847.0
MrMrPunny,"Income is always a difficult subject to consider as an indie dev, especially if you live in the US and are coming from/used to being a salaried employee. There are all sorts of things to consider, not the least of which is the massive amount you’ll be paying to taxes and health insurance (which for employees is stuff that’s taken care of behind the scenes before you even get your check). So the number you ask for is usually a lot higher than most people feel comfortable asking for.

I’m not an indie dev, so I can’t really tell you one way or another. But earlier this year I listened to an awesome couple of podcast episodes from Under the Radar, hosted by Marco Arment and David Smith who are both successful indie devs.  They talk about all the things you need to know and think about when going indie. Each episode is only about 30 minutes so I highly recommend checking out these two episodes.

### Enums Can Carry Values

C++ programmers rejoice, for you no longer have to implement your own discriminated union using The Old Dirty Tricks. Swift enum cases can carry values, and you can poke for those values using `switch` statements or `case` statements in conditionals.

```
enum InfInt {
  case negativeInf
  case integer(Int)
  case positiveInf
}

func getFiniteValue(_ i: InfInt) -> Int? {
  guard case let .integer(val) = i else {
    return nil
  }
  return val
}
```

### Enum Case Constructors Are Functions

Associated values in enum cases are awesome.  But if you come from a language in the ML family, it's just kinda second nature to think of a datatype constructor a function that builds you a value of a type.  Swift's enums are no different!  

```
enum Glass<Liquid> {
  case halfEmpty(Liquid)
  case halfFull(Liquid)
}

func outlook<Liquid>() -> (Liquid) -> Glass<Liquid> {
  return Int.random(in: 1..<100) % 2 == 0 
       ? Glass<Liquid>.halfEmpty 
       : Glass<Liquid>.halfFull
}
```

For those that can remember back to Swift 1.0, it took a while for this feature to make it out to the wider world (in Xcode 7/Swift 2.0 IIRC).  In fact, partial application of a lot things had to be gradually implemented.

### Swifts Enums Are Algebraic Data Types

Using `indirect` you can write recursive (if somewhat inefficient) ADTs just like the best of 'em

```
// Please don't ship this.  This isn't a LISP, you can use Array.
indirect enum List<Element> {
  case empty
  case cons(Element, List<Element>)
}

let example: List<Int> = .cons(1, .cons(2, .cons(3, .empty)))
```

`indirect` at the level of the type causes all the cases to be marked `indirect`.  Naturally, this *can* be inefficient (though, there's no reason it *has* to be implemented with indirection if we can detect it, but I digress†) if you don't actually need the indirection for all the cases.  You can also mark individual cases `indirect` if you want to be more precise.

It turns out a lot of things have a nice recursive structure like this.  And Swift lets you express those things natively and naturally.

†For example, the `empty` case is (transitively) `indirect`, but because it has no associated values you can rest assured you won't eat the cost of a level of indirection for a set of associated values that doesn't actually exist.

### Runtime Layouts of Enums Is Crazy Optimized

Considering just how many different flavors of enum layout that Swift supports (C-compatible, no-payload, singleton, single-payload, multi-payload, resilient, lions, tigers, bears, oh my!), it's safe to say that using an enumeration, even one that carries associated values, isn't going to cost you an arm and a leg at runtime.  On this front, more support for extra inhabitants [was merged for the multi-payload](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/20561) strategy making the compiler even better about bitpacking these things for you automatically.  If anybody wants me to speak more about how this works I can, but it gets a little hairy.

CodaFi,"I thought of another one.

## Labelled Control Flow

So `goto` isn't a keyword in Swift, but that doesn't mean the language doesn't have labelled control flow.  In fact, labels will parse just fine before `while`, `repeat`, `for`, `do`, and `switch` statements.  This feature exists not to allow arbitrary jumps, but rather to disambiguate nested control flow.   The Swift book offers an illuminating, if twisty, example to justify this

```
let finalSquare = 25
var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0”


gameLoop: while square != finalSquare {
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    switch square + diceRoll {
    case finalSquare:
        // diceRoll will move us to the final square, so the game is over
        break gameLoop
    case let newSquare where newSquare > finalSquare:
        // diceRoll will move us beyond the final square, so roll again
        continue gameLoop
    default:
        // this is a valid move, so find out its effect
        square += diceRoll
        square += board[square]
    }
}
print(""Game over!"")”
```

It's interesting that it took Swift until 4.2 to gain this.  Other compiled languages like ANSI C, Common Lisp, and C# have been able to do this since their first version, decades ago.  Surely Swift's designers could have anticipated the need for it.

There were ways to fake it in Swift before, but they were clumsy, and you couldn't easily include a message.  You had to write something that was superficially valid syntax, but wouldn't pass compilation.

    if throwVal != nil {
        throw throwVal!
    }

Don't you think that's a little ironic?

Either way, I may disagree here and there with your coding style, but you do seem to style your code very consistently, I appreciate that.

In case you're not aware, comments right in front of declarations need three slashes in order to be doc comments. Right now those comments don't show up e.g. below the method names in autocomplete.

I was looking for a way to map promises from one type to another, and I couldn't really find it apart from using `then` and returning another promise from the closure. This is such a basic operation that I think you want to include it. See for instance your `maybeAs` method:

    public func `maybeAs`<T>(_ type: T.Type) -> Promise<T?> {
        return Promise<T?>({ (resolve, reject) in
            self.then(onresolve: { (result) in
                resolve(result as? T);
            }, onreject: { (error: Error) -> Void in
                reject(error);
            });
        });
    }

Ideally, the implementation of this would simply be something like

    return map { $0 as? T }

The `as? T` part is the only thing relevant to this method, and the rest is just boilerplate. You're repeating a lot of code throughout the source file and I'd encourage you to find abstractions that make your code more readable and maintainable.

The private `State` enum has several public properties that aren't accessible because the state itself isn't accessible, I guess this is some leftover code from before the state was made private?

There's no need to put `break;` at the end of each case in a `switch`, that happens by default. And similarly, this

    case .resolved: fallthrough
    case .rejected:

can just be written as `case .resolved, .rejected:`.

You store the `resolvers` and `rejecters` of a promise separately from its state, even though these callbacks only need to be stored when the state is `.executing`. You could consider adding those callback arrays as associated values to the `executing` case, then you don't have to rely on removing all callbacks when you're resolving a promise, and you can't accidentally store callbacks when the promise is already resolved.

You switch over `state` 7 times, and each time you have to carefully lock and unlock the `NSLock`. This is quite error-prone, and it's also not very maintainable – if you ever decide to use a serial queue for atomicity instead, it's not going to be a trivial task to make this change correctly. What you could do instead is write a function that takes a `(State) -> Void` closure (or even `(State) -> T`) that takes care of locking and unlocking the lock. If you want to take that even further, you could create a generic `Atomic<Value>` type that stores a value and only lets you access it in a thread-safe way.",1542252826.0

The UIApplication isn't available to you because the system handles it at the time the extension is run.

If you want to access Spotify, you will probably need to create an iOS app that bundles an iMessage extension and require the user to set up the integration through the app. You can then share the authentication with the extension via the app group's container.

thisischemistry,"The problem is that we often have relative newcomers and people who are self-taught with lots of bad habits trying to pass themselves off as experts. Yes, people should share and collaborate but it doesn’t do the community any good to misrepresent your skill level. 

When you post you should be up-front with your experience and be humble about your ideas. A couple of years doing stuff on your own is nothing in the field of computer science, that’s unlikely to make you an expert. There are people with 20, 30 years of experience or more around. Even that might not make them an expert but it’s much more likely!

So the relative newcomers should understand that they probably need to present themselves as such and the old guard needs to be more understanding about the newcomers. That would be the best possible situation for all. However, many self-publishing sites like Medium are used for people’s self-aggrandizement and to get attention by falsely claiming to be an expert. Posts there have a horrible signal-to-noise ratio, especially when they get dumped onto Reddit by karma- and attention-seeking people - many times not even the author of the content.

I’d love to find a solution to this but when I made a post about moderation and improving content it got branded as censorship. So we’re left with this toxic situation. People post a mixed-bag of content and then others overreact to it, there’s not enough healthy discussion because the environment isn’t tuned for it. 

I believe there should be a review policy where someone could submit an article and then receive comments on it for ways to improve it, ways to make it the most useful to the community and then add it to a library of posts. Then newcomers can read a series of reviewed and improved content, cutting down on silly questions and allowing people to truly help each other. There will still be conflicts but it’s a step in the right direction. 

Any other ideas that could help?

Xcode’s base compiler is [LLVM](https://llvm.org) an open source project started by some Apple employees in university years ago. This technology is used widely by many companies and maintained by groups of Apple, Google, Facebook, and other engineers to compile C like languages. Swift has not only made advancements at the language level but works on a higher level [swift compiler](https://swift.org/compiler-stdlib/#compiler-architecture)  with a lot of additions that allow it to have the [REPL](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=18).  This is the `Read Eval Print Loop` feature that makes Playgrounds possible. And implementing that kind of feature for Objective-C would require a massive rewrite of those systems to allow for the compiler to be at the speed needed for REPL.  

I am not saying it can’t be done but even with Apple’s resources it does not make any sense.

nkaffine,"Sign up and login is going to increase the complexity of your app pretty significantly. If you’re new to coding I would highly recommend creating an app that is only on device code.

When you add sign up and login you need to worry about setting up a back end and adding networking to your app which are not simple tasks. 

If your heart is set on an app with sign up and login then go for it, it will come with obstacles but not ones that you won’t be able to overcome. If you’re doing this mostly to learn, you’re going to learn more about IOS development (instead of API development) by doing an app that does all it needs to on device.

There’s even some cool stuff that apple has introduced recently like machine learning on device. Apple has some sample machine learning models and they aren’t super complicated to integrate into your app.

And it's a very simple language feature, [specifying argument labels](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html#ID167). It's so simple that here's the entire topic from the official [Swift Language Guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html):

---

###Specifying Argument Labels

You write an argument label before the parameter name, separated by a space:

    func someFunction(argumentLabel parameterName: Int) {
        // In the function body, parameterName refers to the argument value
        // for that parameter.
    }

Here’s a variation of the `greet(person:)` function that takes a person’s name and hometown and returns a greeting:

     func greet(person: String, from hometown: String) -> String {
        return ""Hello \(person)!  Glad you could visit from \(hometown).""
    }
     print(greet(person: ""Bill"", from: ""Cupertino""))
    // Prints ""Hello Bill!  Glad you could visit from Cupertino.""

The use of argument labels can allow a function to be called in an expressive, sentence-like manner, while still providing a function body that is readable and clear in intent.

Like you I’d been learning swift for a little over a year and wondering how exactly it translates into an app.

I’m one month into a coding boot camp and because of doing daily projects building apps, it’s finally clicked for me.

Basically, first you learn swift.

Then, you have a rough (or detailed) idea for your app.

Then you open Xcode and in Xcode you design each view of your app based on what it does as the user uses the app. (A view is each page of your app that is visible as you use an app e.g the Facebook homepage in your Facebook app is a “view”)

E.g UITableView is a type of view that’s good for displaying lists or other kinds of information you’d usually find in tables. 

When you’re done arranging the different elements that make up each view (like buttons, text, etc), and when you’re don’t arranging the different views that make up your app (like profile page, home page, etc), you connect each “view” to a code file called a “controller”, and inside each controller file, you connect each element (like your buttons or text etc) to a particular piece of code inside your controller file. And that file is where you write the Swift code that will make the visual elements of your app work.

You can start by trying to make the most basic of apps, one that says Hello World when you click a button.

It’s very basic but once you understand the relationship between the swift code and the interface, the lightbulb comes on and you’ll be happy about learning to do more and more things. ",1541641978.0
BenevolentCheese,"What do you mean ""come together?"" You mean building an app?

Do you have programming experience beyond this foray into Swift?

The most basic example of a typical iOS app you could make would be something that, at startup, runs a web request that hits an API for some json, parses that json, and then renders it in a full screen table view. Next you could make it so that when you tap one of the rows, it navigates to a new view with a more detailed view of the content, and has a back button to go back. Then add tabs so that the first tab is all of the above, and the second tab has a couple basic settings—say, displaying units in metric or imperial, or maybe a dark mode filter. Lastly, add a tab that has some sort of input field, which would send a given value to the server.

If you can do all of that, you are well on your way to creating your average app. Things will obviously get a lot more specialized, and there are lots of standard components you'll need to learn as well, but that's your basics and should be your medium term goal. ",1541628652.0
b_b_q,"If you already know the absolute basics (variables, functions, classes etc) then in all honesty, the best way to learn is to think of a project that you would like to build and just jump head first into it. 

When you hit a hurdle you can google/ask for help as you go. This has a few main benefits; the main one is that you are working on a personal project you enjoy and are therefore motivated to keep going. Another, is that it breaks down the learning process into logical steps, rather than trying to learn EVERYTHING and THEN applying it to a project, you are learning as you build.

In the same way, focus on what you’re wanting to create. You can learn the basics of Swift, but you’ll eventually need to focus on learning what you need to learn to accomplish your purpose. For instance, if you need to make a table, how do you do that with the iOS SDK? Or if you need to pass data between two view controllers, maybe brush up in delegation.

atticmanatee,"Couple of things:

1 - Reading/Writing from UserDefaults on every cell is bad. Regardless of how fast the disk IO is, reading from memory is faster. As such you should instantiate all values in memory before using them on the table view aka create a var on your view did load with what you need, pass a reference to the cell and that’s what you change. And when a value changes, change said instance and save on view will disappear. 

2 - Your button switch should be on the TicketTableViewCell class.

3 - It’s not usually needed to force UserDefaults to synchronize, but it’s useful if you’re doing a bunch of IO operations from disk. 

Without reading more of your code it’s hard to know for sure what’s happening, mostly because you didn’t share your TicketTableViewCell, but here’s my advice:

Create a class user options where you have all the data. Why a class? Because when you say something is equal to it, you’re passing a reference, not creating a copy. 
    Class UserOptions {
        let title: String
        let selected: Bool
     
        init(optionTitle: String, selection: Bool){
            self.title = optionTitle
            self.selected = selection
        {
    }

Somewhere on you view life cycle create an array that will hold all the options, say you view did load. 

On your TicketTableViewCell add a method for setting up your cell. And add a reference (aka var) to your options 

    var options: UserOptions!
    func setup(withOptions sentOptions: UserOptions){
        self.options = sentOptions
        self.headingLbl.text = options.title
        self.switchBtn.isOn = options.selected
    }
     
    @IBAction func switchBtnTapped(_ sender: UISwitch) {        print(sender.isOn)
        self.options.selected = sender.isOn            }
On your tableView cellForRow: atIndexPath function, change it so you use the method we created. 

    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
     
        var options = self.options[indexPath.row]
     
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: ""tickCell"") as! TickTableViewCell
        cell.setup(withOptions: options)
     
        return cell
    }

With this done, you just need to save your data when you leave the view, and it should work.

If with these changes it doesn’t work PM me and we can go over more of your code. ",1541318855.0

In this case, if you are treating your NSPersistentContainer as a singleton (which storing it as a property on the app delegate really is), then you should think about making a dedicated singleton object.

That avoids the extra logic steps – it becomes ""I'm going to grab the global Core Data object"" rather than ""I'm going to grab the global application, access its delegate, force-cast that delegate, then grab the global Core Data object from there.""

There's no need to decode every field that's sent to you, so just decode the ones you're actively using. So I'd just keep the stub of the ThingMetadata struct there, ready to add the extra properties to once they become useful.

It's good practice to not write code that you're not going to use anyway (YAGNI principle). But once you've got the stub of the metadata object, it's at least easy to add in bits once they have a purpose.

Nepuznic,"If you aren't aware, `mutating` is a keyword that denotes that the object's reference to `self` will be changed. In other words, the object itself changes completely.

Struct properties are inherently immutable. This means that whenever you ""modify"" a property, an entirely new struct is actually created since the properties *cannot* be modified.

    struct x {
        var y: Int

        init(y: Int) {
            self.y = y
        }

        mutating func changeY(to value: Int) {
             self = x(y: value) // EQUIVALENT to y = value
        }
    }

When you modify a class's `var` property, you don't need to create an entirely new instance of that class since `var` properties are inherently mutable. Note that in a theoretical world where mutating functions work on classes, you would actually be able to modify `let` properties of a class 😲

    class x {
        var y: Int
    
        init(y: Int) {
            self.y = y
        }
       
        func changeY(to value: Int) {
            y = value // var is mutable; instance member value changed
        }
    }

Note: Below code doesn't compile since `self` is immutable, but theoretically the following is expected if you want to change a `let` property:

    class x {
        let y: Int
        
        init(y: Int) {
            self.y = y
        }

tonygoold,"Simply put, structs are read-only. When you do this:

    var p = CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0)
    p.x += 1

What's really happening (edit: _at a semantic level_) is this, where it creates a new struct:

    var p = CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0)
    p = CGPoint(x: p.x + 1, y: p.y)

In fact, those two statements are literally equivalent as long as CGPoint's initializer has a trivial implementation (does nothing but set those properties). Now consider this extension:

    extension CGPoint {
        func doNothing() {}
        mutating func incrX() { x += 1 }
    }

Both `doNothing` and `incrX()` have function signatures `() -> ()`, but `incrX()` has to create a new struct in order to modify `x`. How does it pass that new struct back to the caller? By declaring it `mutating`, it's really implemented by the compiler as `() -> CGPoint`. Now, you might ask, why doesn't the compiler automatically turn non-mutating functions into mutating functions? Because if you write a library this way and only distribute it without the Swift source code, then a library user's compiler has no way of knowing the function really returns a new struct.",1540991343.0
rennarda,"Structs are value types, whereas classes are reference types. This is explained in detail in the Swift book from Apple, so I'd advise you take a look there to get the full low-down. 

Essentially, a when something is a value type it means that the value IS the identity of the object. The number '2' is a value because it's meaningless to say this number '2' is different to that number '2' - 2 always being 2 is kind of fundamental to mathematics! 

The same applies to more complex types such as structs with many properties. If all the properties are the same then that object IS identical to any other instance of that struct with those values (even this wording is wrong, because there is no other instance - they ARE the same thing).

So, in a struct, if you have a function that changes one of the values you have to mark it mutating because it indicates that this function will alter the identity of the struct. The struct after calling the function will be a different struct to before the function was called.

Now, classes are different. An instance of a class is a separate thing to any other instance of that class. You will have a reference to these objects, but even if their properties have identical values, they still remain separate objects. Imagine I have a number '2' door number to hang on my door - that's a separate thing to any other number '2' door number that exists. It's meaningless to treat them as the same, even if they were manufactured from exactly the same material, etc. They are separate instances of 'number 2 door numbers'. If I painted mine a different colour, it's still the same physical object as it was before I painted it, and being painted doesn't change any other 'number 2' door numbers out there.",1540997871.0
nielsbot,"@rennarda said it too, but here's my take. I'll try to keep it short...

A struct in Swift is treated as a single piece of data. (What Swift people call a ""value type"")

I have struct `Box`, and I make a variable `b1` containing a `Box`, like this:

    let b1 = Box()

`b1` is declared `let`. Since a Box() is a treated as a single piece of data (a value), changing anything about the `Box` in `b1` breaks the rules of `let`. (Swift guarantees that `b1` is immutable.) 

If anything is going to change (mutate) `b1`, you must declare that. That's where `mutating` comes in. Any function on `Box` that might change some part of it must be declared `mutating`, like this:

    struct Box() {
        var isOpen = false
        mutating func open() {
            isOpen = true
        }
    }

Now that we've done that, let's go back to `let` vs `var`. This is not allowed in Swift:

    let b1 = Box()
    b1.open() // calling a mutating function on a non-mutable (let) value

But this is fine:

    var b2 = Box()
    b2.open() 

`b2` is mutated (changed) by `open()`, but that's ok, since `b2` is `var`, not `let`

What about classes?

It's confusing, but a variable holding a class instance always contains a __reference__ to that instance, not the instance itself. (The single chunk of data in the variable is a reference, a special kind of value in Swift) 

Let's say I have class `Container`, and assign a `Container` reference to a `let` variable `c1`:

    let c1 = Container()

`let` here guarantees that the reference in `c1` cannot be mutated, but does not guarantee anything about the instance that `c1` refers to. If I assign `c1` to a new variable `c2`:

    let c2 = c1

I have copied the reference from `c1` to `c2`. The reference value in `c1` and `c2` cannot be changed, and `c1` and `c2` refer to the same instance. Having `let` references doesn't guarantee anything about the thing being referred to (your class instance) being mutated or not.

Comare with struct variables: When you assign a struct value to a variable, it's treated as a single piece of data, so each variable has its own copy:

    let b1 = Box()
    let b2 = b1 // b2 now contains is own copy of b1

randomblast,"For me it comes down to the difference between errors and valid states which happen to be `nil`.

Something which must exist for the program to succeed is a `Something`. Something which could legitimately exist or not exist in all states is a `Optional<Something>`.

When you force-unwrap an Optional, you're explicitly saying that you *know* that the unwrap will succeed, and you swear on the life of your process. If you were wrong, it's an immediate boom. `abort()` with no chance to recover.

That's perfectly acceptable if you've done the maths nearby and it's obvious that you know something the compiler doesn't. I wouldn't force-unwrap in any other case though. There's a much better option - exceptions.

Exceptions are for when a condition *must* be met in order to continue with your function, but the condition isn't met. If that condition is that you must unwrap an optional, the usual way is to use a guard let.

Here's a contrived example:

```swift
enum DocumentError : Error {
    case fileNotFound
    case missingId
    case invalidId
}

struct Document {
    /// Must be even for arbitrary architectural reason
    let id: UInt32

    /// Most documents don't say anything useful.
    /// We can represent useless documents as well
    let usefulInformation: String?

    init(content: Data) throws {
        if content.count < MemoryLayout<UInt32>.size {
            throw DocumentError.missingId
        }

        id = content.withUnsafeBytes { $0.pointee }
        if id % 2 != 0 {
            throw DocumentError.invalidId
        }

        usefulInformation = String(bytes: content.advanced(by: MemoryLayout.size(ofValue: id)),
                                   encoding: .utf16)
    }
}


func documentAtPath(filePath: String) throws -> Document {
    guard let data = FileManager.default.contents(atPath: filePath) else {
        throw DocumentError.fileNotFound
    }

    return try Document(content: data)
}
```

In C++ a lot of engineers shy away from exceptions because of their expense and innate footgun quality. Even more engineers use them for flow control, and I wish those people a merciful post-apodisation death. Swift exceptions are genuinely usable, and can be considered another orthogonal result of a function; like you would use `Result<T, E>` in Rust - if you're familiar.

It's not practical with Swift exceptions to do that awful Java/C++ trick of wrapping your entire application in a `try/catch` \- the language enforces that you decide what to do with every throwing function. You can decide to just rethrow it, but that means you have to mark *that* function as `throws`, until you get back to `main()`. Usually there is a point quite soon up the call stack where you can handle the `Error` in a meaningful, sensible way - either try an alternative path or inform the user of the failure.",1540948006.0

inscrutablemike,"I've followed the development of Swift since 1.1 and the use of optionals and force unwrapping seems to have settled on a couple of philosophical points:

1. Optional data types should be the exception. Most data types should be designed to hold a guaranteed value, preferably in a struct rather than a class, and should have some known state at all times. The fact that a type might hold nil means that the programmer has to take special care with it and consciously consider how that fact impacts their code structure. Swift treats optionals as a thing one must explicitly adopt because this is a common source of bugs in most programming languages and Swift has attempted to design away the causes of common bugs.  

2. Force-unwrapped optionals are meant to be used in code that bridges Swift with another language that has no notion of optional types or code that deals with raw pointers or memory buffers - and that's pretty much it. In both of those cases, the programmer is expected to wrap that dangerous code in some Swift-y interface that guarantees the Right Thing Will Happen. It's an absolutely essential capabilty, but circumvents the philosophy of point #1 for those cases where it can't be avoided.

Correct.  Because you're looking at it from the wrong perspective....it's not about you, it's about your users. For example, I'm currently working in a library that's several person decades of code, and used in several apps that are are also several person decades worth of code.  Threre are thousands or tens of thousands of optionals that better not be optional or the lib ceases to function partially or  even completely. Some of these could become nil because of a misconfiguration on the server.  This would be a problem but an isolated problem.  Several million people a day would carry on using these apps and never even notice there was an issue.  Maybe another million would notice that some or part of that feature was replaced with an error dialog.  A few hundred thousand of them would be fairly annoyed about it.  But that's way better than every single user getting a crash, and millions of people being angry, many of whom will give us bad reviews and leave comments about how our app is a crashy piece of junk. Correct optional handling forces you to think about how serious the problem is and what the recovery options are. Can you just no-op and return with no harm done?  Can you use a sane default value that won't break anything?  Is the feature really and truly  hosed?  The entire app?  Those really critical nils ought to bubble up to user facing error screens very quickly.  Use fallible initializers.  Entire subsystems should never even be allocated if some of the more critical optionals are nil.  Also you can assert on the more important optionals so you get the crash at the source of the problem in debug builds, but you're still *forced* to write the error handling code that'll run in release builds.  Doing it this way also pushes you to minimize optionals. Don't like writing all that error handling code?  Use sane defaults, push optional handling of important dependencies into fallible initializers, so they're not optional, turn critical missing data into errors at the API layer rather than passing around data full of nils.  Optionals are bad things to be avoid wherever reasonably possible.....but be thankful you have type level support for them when they're unavoidable, which is fairly often :)",1541092768.0

hollowaytyl,"TL:DR — just get started. 



I agree with the consensus. I started with Swift as my first language in 2015 and purchased the iOS9 programming book. Before you know it we were on iOS10 and Swift went from 1 to 2. I basically neglected the book I paid for and bought tutorials and lesson plans on how to build calculators and stuff like that. Before you know it, we were on Swift 3. I ended up neglecting the tutorials I paid for and just went straight into building a project. It’s now 2018 and I’m still building that same project. 

It’s my personal opinion that learning the right way should be encouraged — however, I learned best by just saying fuck it and jumping right into the mud. I’m building a social networking app. The concepts I learn are concepts that I need to learn to build a social networking app. It’s my opinion — though I understand that’s it’s an incorrect opinion — that I’m better off this way. I’m not wasting time learning everything iOS. If I need to know how to upload an image to a database, I google it or ask Reddit. If I need to know how to upload to the App Store, I ask Google or Reddit. As I said, I’ve been building the same app for three years (it’s my second app). Today, I’ll learn that having a large storyboard file isn’t optimal and then go back and change something I haven’t touched since 2016. If I learn that it’s better to do expensive user interface animations on the background thread — I’ll adjust code I haven’t read since 2017. These are things I didn’t know when I jumped in head first, but they are things I corrected as I learned. 

If you want a focused learning experience, I suggest you just start building because you don’t know what you need to learn until you’re trying to build it. You said build an app and not get a job right? It’s all about what you want to do with this stuff. Let’s say you build the next cool billion dollar app and need to hire people to grow and maintain it. How many CEOs do you think hire people who are 100x smarter than them to work for them? (A LOT, MAYBE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!!!); so if these are the shoes you plan you walk in, how much iOS do you think you could compromise just to “fake it until you make it”? I’m not encouraging any insincere ambitions or goals to truly want to embrace this beautiful language — I’m accounting for another variable that I’m aware of as it pertains to my experience. Along the way you’re going to write bad code and fuck up but that’s what makes it worth it. We’ll always be here to help you. One of the things I remember is how alone I felt when I was learning; and then I found Reddit and Stack Overflow. 

This is how I keep everything into perspective as it pertains to software: if you have an idea and you’ve seen it somewhere, it’s possible for you to program the same thing. When I keep this in mind it helps me realize that the answer is out there. I’ll leave you with a quote that I immediately think about when shit gets tough:

“Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think” — Steve Jobs

Sometimes you’ll ask a question here without a reply. Sometimes Google and Stack Overflow can’t help you either. Think about this quote in your head and keep rethinking the problem. If you keep repeating this, you’ll always figure it out. I promise.  

Jump into the rabbit hole — you’re ready. 

Good luck!

KarlJay001,"One language I worked with for over 10 years, I ran a business with it and worked as an employee using it.  There was no book published that I didn't read on it.  After about 2 or 3 years, the skills didn't really change much.  You can think of it as riding a bike.  Everything you NEED to know about riding a bike can be learned in less that 1 day, maybe even a few hours.  Then you practice for say, 3 to 6 months and you're probably 80~90% as good as you're going to get in order to ride a bike for the rest of your life.

Programming has much more things to know, but knowing EVERYTHING from pure memory has very, very little commercial value.  I had to look up date formatting a few years ago for one project, it wasn't that I was new to programming, it's that I've never done date formatting in ObjC before.

If you limit yourself to loading data from RESTful APIs to tableviews, you could make a nice template in a month or so and be ready for years of professional work just doing that.

162bfizzy,"First off, I've always compared coding with art.  I think many of the attributes that make someone a good software engineer are also present in great artists.  The willingness to see unique solutions to problems, the creativity to imagine how to take logical statements and craft them into something functional, etc.  

So, to me asking ""when?"" is like asking when are you ready to start painting or writing.  Just start.  Your first projects will be laughable to you in a year but without having solved the problems in your first project, you will never do a second or third project where you can use what you've learned.  

Not even large companies produce perfection.  There are always bugs, better ways of doing things, a clearer understanding of the problem being solved, etc.  Don't be afraid that what you create might be hodge-podge and full of inefficient code.  

Another good comparison is with learning spoken languages.  You can't wait until you can speak French like a native-French speaker before you start using it.  Go to France and try to order a coffee.  People are going to say things to you and you don't know words they are using and you'll have to ask them to explain or go look them up.  That's how you learn.  

Coding is very much the same way.  You get to a problem and you search Google for an answer and suddenly you can do it.  And you know how to do it on the next project and project after that.  

You can't expect to just listen to people speaking French and learn French.  You have to get out there and use the language and stumble and make silly grammar mistakes, or pronounce a word incorrectly.  That's how you learn.  

The educational stuff you're doing reading books or taking online courses is great.  But your learning really takes off when you start using what you've learned and running into your own problems.  ",1541005022.0

Yes, there is a cost associated with creating a `DateFormatter` but there are very few instances where the cost will seriously impact the speed of your app. Unless you're rapidly creating a bunch of them I wouldn't bother optimizing around them.

The first rule of optimization is to create the simplest and most clear code. Then profile your app and see where there are significant slowdowns.

I bring this up because I'm not sure the +/- on each cell is a great UI/UX.  It takes screen real estate.

IMO, there's at least two aspects to developing a great app.  One is making it functional and they other is a great UI.  If you do your logic well, changing the UI shouldn't be a big problem, however, that means all the layout you've done will have to be reworked.  So it's worth thinking about a great UI layout.

The other option is to write a server-side app and a simple interface in Swift, doing most of your work in Python on the server. However, this has some drawbacks too so it all depends on what your app does and how it works.",1540655897.0
spinwizard69,"First off to learn Swift download Apples manual!!   It is very well written and free.  

Second don’t run even consider Objective C, the sooner Objective C dies the better in my opinion.  I’m not what you would call a full time programmer and most of my recent work has been in Python, I consider It Objective C to be the opposite of Python when it comes to readability.  In general I hated Objective C every time I had to use it.   

Third the APIs for iOS will be a bigger learning curve than Swift.   This is pretty much the case for any windowing system but iOS and Mac OS can throw you some curves so expect to take some time to adapt.  The API selection is pretty huge so make a point to see if there is an Apple supported way to do something before rolling your own or using a third party library.   Also slightly related there is a quickly growing collection of third party libraries and a Swift package manager.  So search before writing.  

Forth XCode is just another IDE!   For simple projects you can get under way pretty quickly.  

Fifth as much as I love Python it isn’t the language to ship executables.  I know that this will ruffle feathers but it is even more important on mobile where power usage is a factor.   You will want to structure your software to minimize power usage else have the anger of the user community thrown at you.  So you would need to use a language that compiles to native code even if Python was usable on iOS.  The nice thing is that elements of Swift are not that far removed from Python in ease of use and code clarity.

spinwizard69,"While this all sounds very liberal, like most things with that lean in that direction, what you will end up with is censorship, gross arguments about opinion and a very disfunctional forum.  Frankly it flys in the face of what an open forum that discuss Swift in a general way should be.  

Now I’m not dismissing your point here at all, this just isn’t the place for such a forum.  One option would be a set practices reddit so that the function of the forum is clear.   Another idea would be a well maintained web site that is actually owned by the people passing judgement on the code.  

Beyond all of that best practices are often judgements made in time that don’t hold water over time.  This especially as a language evolves over time.  This fluidity has been an issue in the C++ community as what is considered best practices has evolved significantly over time.  In the case of Swift we are talking about a language and library set that isn’t even stable. So if someone was to setup a web site devoted to Swift best practices they will need the time and energy to review content as practice and the language evolves.  

So no I don’t think this is a good idea especially considering the way that reddit and /r/swift operate.   If somebody thinks that a code fragment posted here is bad in some way, a rational (calm and reasoned) response should be posted.  Leave it up to the reader to decide what fits his code.  Beyond that as a reader here, to in part learn about Swift, I’m less likely to find advantage in one sided discussions or censored communications.   As a reader that moment when the light bulb clicks on is often the result of a conversation where differing perspectives come up.   Sometimes understanding why you would do something in a given way requires a deeper understanding of things than might be obvious in the project at hand.   Excessive moderation just leads to posts that are very thin on the hows and whys.  

In a nut shell censorship isn’t the thing we want to see in a forum focused on Swift in a general sense.    Moderation can be very distructive to a technical forum especially if the wrong people get involved in that censorship.  

Beyond that has there been enough time with Swift for people to really develop a set of best practices?    In some cases possibly but has anyone developed to the point that they consider themselves a Swift expert?   ",1540566575.0

I may be wrong, but I believe you do still have to have a privacy policy because, even though you're not remotely accessing the data, the user still needs to know what data is collected locally and what it is used for. A very basic privacy policy (i.e., just list the data collected and what it is used for, and that it is not accessed remotely) should cover all the bases until the app needs to connect to the internet, but a privacy policy is required nonetheless. When you do connect the app to the internet, you may also need to alert your existing users to what would amount to a major change in the privacy policy.

Also, that claim conflicts with the next one that it uses more memory than storyboards. A XIB file will decode every object inside of it into memory when the file is loaded.

thisischemistry,"Do you have any experience programming at all?

I'd start with simple terminal programs on macOS or just playgrounds. Avoid any user interface (UI) stuff in the beginning, do some stuff that involves numbers and then move on to manipulating text. Stuff like calculating Fibonacci numbers, reversing text, sorting things, figuring out the largest item in an array. Very basic but learning.

Then move on to user interaction, either in the terminal or through a graphical user interface (GUI). Make a simple calculator or question-and-answer app. Maybe a guessing game. After you've done a few of those start thinking of more complicated programs to make. 

Keep everything as modular as possible, the less the parts interact the easier it is to program them. Think of every part as a Lego brick, self-contained and it has a way to link to other parts. Functions do one simple thing, they take in a few parameters and output their result. They never modify anything outside of themselves. Methods in a struct or class can modify the properties of that struct or class but still try to keep them very simple and have few side effects. The same goes for structs and classes, keep them simple and doing one very specific thing with little involvement of anything outside their own properties.

Use your file structure, generally keep one file per struct or class unless you have a group that's very closely tied together and can't exist on their own. Make groups and organize your files by them. For example, make a group called Views and put all your views into it, make a group called Model and put all of your data types into that. Look up patterns such as Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-View Model (MVVM), Model-View-Presenter (MVP) and organize around those patterns.

That's not possible. Inflexibility is death in programming, especially in an environment where things change every year on you, if not faster (considering changes in App Store rules). 

Step one, write your goals down.

Most iOS screens are evolutions from basic types shown in the [HIG](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/). Plot a simpler version of your end idea on a piece of paper. Work off the [basic app structures](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/navigation/) shown in there and implement a simplistic version of your end idea there. 

Try it out by poking the paper. Does it accomplish some goals? If not, why not. Now, find *one attribute* of the system to make more elaborate. Now do that. Does that accomplish your goals better? When you're done poking paper and imagining, take what your final drawing so far is, and make it in code using fake data, simplistic UI elements, and very little animation. 

Does that work now? 

Alright, now write down all the improvements you could do to make it better. Now write down how much you think each of those would make it better (units don't matter). Now write down how long each could take to design, and do.  Write down how much time you'll spend max on that idea before jettisoning it. 

Do 1 item off that list that's going to be worth a lot of value to the project, but isn't going to cost that much. Do that repeatedly. 

After some architectural issue is a drag repeatedly while coding, refactor out something into an abstraction that helps you. 

When you fail to meet a deadline, stash that code in a branch, revert, then do a different feature. 

Keep doing this repeatedly until you have a good enough project to test with people. Show people, ask them to do things it is supposed to do. If they can do them, great. If they cannot, work on help text, design changes, and other bug fixes until people can.

NodeJS for example has a low memory footprint comparing it to Java, and Swift is 2x better than NodeJS when it comes to memory. If you look at computational speed NodeJS is no match to Java and Swift does an even better job than Java.

First off don’t be so easy to believe idiots!   

Second if you are on a quest to learn a programming language instead of learning computer science you are on the wrong track.   If you understand the science, the language you implement your solutions in won’t be a big deal.  More importantly a strong CS background allows you to choose the right tools for the job.  Often that might mean working with more than one language.  To look at it another way your lack of a strong CS degree resulted in this question.   

Third the alternative on Apples systems was Objective C!    Swift, which is a very young language, already has wider adoption than Objective C ever did. 

Fourth Swift is being ported to other platforms including Linux and Windows.   More importantly users on those platforms are getting buy in because Swift offer significant advantages over other offerings.   Given that a switch to modern languages doesn’t happen overnight.  It takes time for a community to acknowledge advantages and start a migration.  

Fifth Swift is hardly a mature programming language!   In fact it is under rapid development.  It is fair to say that the language and its libraries don’t have all the features even Apple wants or needs.   This makes Swift development bleeding edge even if that edge isn’t as sharp as it was 2 years ago.  So you really can’t expect massive adoption on other platforms at this time.   If you watch other successful and widely used languages develop over time, the successful ones like Python take awhile to leave the niche they developed in to wider acceptance.   Some languages like Ruby never leave their little niche.  Will Swift blow up to be the Python of the next two decades?   I can’t predict; all I can say is the right features exist for that too happen.  It is all about having the mind set in the community say yeah this is pretty good.  

To put it another way, the advice you are getting is crap.   Because no matter what platform you are on you have two issues.  One is learning the common language of that platform - this is the easy part.   The second issue is learning the API to the GUI and system which is a far bigger chore.

Swift had HUGE backing from Apple, Stanford, RayW, the whole book/tutorial world basically dropped ObjC like a hot rock.  Swift made it.  Cordova and HTML5 and all the other ""great solutions"" didn't make it.

One thing about Swift was that you can mix ObjC and Swift, the APIs were exactly the same...  From buttons to textfields, all the APIs were the same, so you walked in from ObjC, 1/2 way done just because you knew Xcode and the iOS APIs.

RN and others are very different, they don't have any of these advantages.  There's not years of RN code for iOS on GitHub to pick from.  It's not ""tried and true"" like Swift/ObjcC/iOS APIs are.

Businesses have to find a balance, they need programmers that can get the job done, having source code written in some ""odd ball"" language isn't going to attract good programming talent.  A programmer going into something risky like this is almost a ""kiss of death"" to their career.

This is explained further by Ben Cohen in [What's New in Swift - WWDC 17](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/402/) at 35 minutes in, which covers slicing strings but also applies to arrays and other collections.",1539825151.0

Beardo01,"Hey bundycamp,

I recently faced a similar problem to you, but instead of writing in Swift, I've been using Dart via Flutter. As some others have pointed out you probably want to go with Google's Cloud Functions; albeit you'll need to write them in either Javascript or Typescript (via NodeJS, which is the recommended approach). Google has some pretty good documentation [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) which should get you started. 

If you haven't settled on a database yet, I'd highly recommend trying out Cloud Firestore. Again, you can find some documentation [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) to get you started. The benefit here is that Cloud Functions and Cloud Firestore are designed to work well together, so there is good support from Google. Cloud Functions have libraries which let you connect directly to your database and work with it. This is a very easy process once you get your head around a few basics of Firestore. A word of caution though, is that Firestore is a NoSQL database so if you only have experience using traditional relational databases, it will take a bit of time to get used to NoSQL (I've just been down that journey and from a learning perspective alone, am very happy I've done it).

Finally, in terms of running things at set points in the day, Google doesn't support CRON jobs for Cloud Functions yet, although you can very easily setup a Google App Engine instance which calls your Cloud Functions at certain points in the day using Cloud Functions http.callable method. This all sounds confusing (and jargon-y), I know, but I promise it is way easier than it sounds and is all mapped out in [this](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2017/03/how-to-schedule-cron-jobs-with-cloud.html) fantastic article.

thisischemistry,"Yes, you should define a structure per JSON object. Since the JSON represents an API you should be able to count on the fields being there to map into your structures. If any fields might be optional then mark them properly as `Optional`.

With `JSONDecoder` you'll have a simple conversion of your JSON string into structures without needing any casting and with proper error handling.

In your case, since `images` is a JSON array of strings you can represent it with `[String]` and not a separate `struct`.

Just so you know, your ""results"" objects only have these keys, there is no ""images"" key in there:

    section
    subsection
    title
    abstract
    url
    byline
    item_type
    updated_date
    created_date
    published_date
    material_type_facet
    kicker
    des_facet
    org_facet
    per_facet
    geo_facet
    multimedia

The ""multimedia"" object has the ""url"" key which seems to link to images.

I'd change your code to the following:

    struct Story: Decodable {
      let title: String
      let abstract: String
      let url: String
      let multimedia: [Multimedia]
    }

    struct Multimedia: Codable {
      let url: String
      let type: String
    }

Then test if `type` is ""image"" to be sure that `url` links to an image.

Here are some suggestions for other common questions/answers we get a lot:

**Q: Is Some Particular Mac model good enough to learn Swift?**

A: If it runs Mojave, it's good enough. If it only runs up to High Sierra it's *probably* good enough, but very old devices might have a hard time. Having a 13-inch laptop won't hold you back from coding, but you might find storyboards a bit tricky.

**Q: What newsletters are there?**

A: Try some of these:

- [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com/)
- [iOS Goodies](https://ios-goodies.com/)
- [Swift Developments](https://andybargh.com/swiftdevelopments/)
- [Indie iOS Focus](https://indieiosfocus.com/)


**Q: Are there any good podcasts?**

A: There are lots to choose from:

- [Fireside Swift](https://www.firesideswift.com/)
- [Swift over Coffee](https://www.anchor.fm/swiftovercoffee)
- [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped)
- [iPhreaks](https://devchat.tv/iphreaks/)
- [Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast)
- [Contravariance](https://contravariance.rocks/)


**Q: Why does Swift keep changing?**

A: Swift continues to evolve as new features are added, but these are mostly additive – they won't break old code, but just add new features to make certain tasks easier. You might find [WhatsNewInSwift.com](http://whatsnewinswift.com/) useful.


**Q: Why does my playground keep freezing?**

A: It's not just you :(


**Q: Why are strings different from other languages?**

A: Swift won't you read indexes inside strings using integers, such as `someString[5]`. This is because letters in strings vary in size, from short ones like ""A"" to ones that are complex to store such as emoji. So, to find the fifth character Swift needs to start from the beginning and count through – it's a slow process, and they don't want to make it look easier than it is.


**Q: Optionals: what the heck?**

A: Right? You're not alone – it gets better.

Saklad5,"What is the best way to store references to Core Data objects in structs?

&#x200B;

Storing `NSManagedObjectID`s doesn’t seem to work, since I can’t get permanent IDs for objects that aren’t saved yet. I know there is a function that supposedly does just that, but the IDs are invalidated when I save the context and it merges conflicting objects together by property.

&#x200B;

My current solution is to store a property I have set up as a constraint in a private attribute, then fetch based on that constraint using a public computed property.

`private let objectConstraint: ConstraintType`

`var object: ObjectType { get{return fetchObject(objectConstraint)} }`

&#x200B;

This feels extremely inefficient, since it means I am running a fetch request whenever I access the object. Is there a better approach?

It is harsh but it just works... Adobe switched to a similar cloud-tied licensing approach for their applications, and apparently it reduced piracy significantly.

That can be because of data normalization, changing requirements, or simply different goals. Concepts like a ViewModel exist to mediate those kinds of interactions but that's not the only approach.

> The arrays within the dictionary created in step 2 are populated in a random order so that ""apple"" isn't always the first entry

That is expected. *Dictionaries are inherently unordered*. If you want to extract the data in a particular sequence, you need to get a copy of [keys](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dictionary/keys) and then sort them. And then pass them back to the dictionary one at a time to get the related value. Or use some other kind of data object.

What you really need to do is make your own data structure instead of relying on dictionaries. Something like this (the details would depend on your specific needs):

    struct Picture {
    	var url: URL
    	var image: UIImage?
    }
    
    struct PictureCategory {
    	var name: String
    	var pictures: [Picture]
    }

You transform the snapshot into an array of 'PictureCategory' objects representing the sections in the collection view. Then, when the user taps a cell, you pass the category for that section along with the cell's row as an index to the full screen view controller. That VC can then start with the 'Picture' at that index and go forward/back through all of the others in the parent category.



There are issues around struct vs. class and mutability and how to download the image but hopefully that gives you something to think about.",1539644440.0
ShottyMcKeith,">  I feel like in this case I am relying on converting the data rather than figuring out how to structure it properly in the first place. 

That is a concern, but my point is that the needs of an app are different than the needs of Firebase (or other database/service) and the best way to represent data in one context isn’t always the same as another. So some degree of transformation can be necessary and even good. (It’s all about the trade offs) And of course sometimes you have to work with an API that you don’t control so have to adapt to it.

Now, if you are transforming the data repeatedly *within* the app just to pass the data around than that is a separate issue.",1539653489.0

I have an app that makes network requests to various API endpoints, and an enum with associated values makes for a really clean way of generating the URLs for the requests. For example, consider this code:

    fileprivate let ApiEndpoint = ""http://api-example-url.com/""

    enum BackendRequestType: String {

So when I need the URL for an API call, I can do something like:

    let requestType = BackendRequestType.users
    let url = requestType.url

The same happens when using any other value types, such as Ints, in the following snippet:

    var number = 0
    var otherNumber = number
    otherNumber = 10
    
    // number == 0
    // otherNumber == 10

The main reason for naming individual tuple elements is that it gives them more descriptive names than `tuple.0`, `tuple.1`, etc.

Furthermore, using name labels allows you to ignore part of the tuple, in cases where you might not need all of it, such as when a function returns a tuple, or you only want certain values from another tuple e.g.

    let myNumberTuple = (0,1,2,3)
    let (firstNum, secondNum, _, _) = myNumberTuple
    print(firstNum)
    
    // prints “0”

If you want to modify a tuple, you can do so by assigning back to `tuple.0`, `tuple.1`, etc.

Also in the realm of generics, reasoning about `associatedtype`s and the fact that there isn't a good way to specialize protocols them for the purpose of use as a type constraint gets messy so fast.

Then I've got a pretty long feature wishlist for Swift. I'd love to be able to do scripting with Swift, but file interaction is mad verbose. I've got a lengthy set of extensions to make working with Strings closer to how it is in Python (which I love), but without those working with Strings is a bit of a pain. It's gotten better recently, but still.

The other stuff I'd like is pretty niche. Variadic generics would be awesome. Improved reflection would be awesome. A few other small things, that's where I'm at.",1539483128.0

Think about it like this: Students have name, genders, eyes colors etc. They are not optional in life. So why would it make sense to create a blank `Student` without those values? You are fighting against one of the core values of Swift: **Safety**.

itaiferber,"/u/fort_and_langley is correct: `Codable` works primarily using compiler synthesis of methods and implementations, without dynamic help or metaprogramming. There are 3 main components to the feature:

1.	The standard library [protocols and types](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/public/core/Codable.swift.gyb),
2.	The Swift compiler portions which synthesize [implementations for `Codable`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/lib/Sema/DerivedConformanceCodable.cpp) ([and `CodingKey`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/lib/Sema/DerivedConformanceCodingKey.cpp))
3.	Implementations in Foundation for [`JSONEncoder`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/public/SDK/Foundation/JSONEncoder.swift) and [`PropertyListEncoder`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/public/SDK/Foundation/PlistEncoder.swift)

The part you’re likely interested in is the compiler portion, which happens as follows:

1.	When a type conforms to `Encodable`/`Decodable`/both, it has to provide implementations of `encode(to:)`/`init(from:)`. If a type has protocol requirements but does not provide method implementations which fulfill the requirements, the compiler will generally give an error; however, there are a few special types for which the compiler is allowed to synthesize the method implementations necessary to *make* the types conform (e.g. `RawRepresentable` methods on enums with a raw type, and more recently `Hashable` and `Equatable` implementations for most trivial types). `Encodable` and `Decodable` are some of these types, and by “synthesize” I mean that the compiler effectively “writes” the code for you, as if you had typed it out yourself (this is done by modifying the AST—abstract syntax tree—the representation the compiler has of the code you’ve written)
2.	When the compiler looks to synthesize `Encodable`/`Decodable` conformance, it looks to see if the type has a nested enum type called `CodingKeys` which conforms to `CodingKey`. (This type can be provided via a `typealias` as well). If the type isn’t an enum, or doesn’t conform to `CodingKeys`, synthesis isn’t possible and the compiler will give an error; if the type doesn’t exist, the compiler will then try to synthesize the `CodingKeys` enum as well
3.	To do this, the compiler looks at all of the properties on the conforming type (skipping computed, static, and lazy vars) — if all are `Encodable`/`Decodable`, then synthesis is possible. It modifies the AST to insert a new type typed `private enum CodingKeys : String, CodingKey` with a case for every `Codable` property. (If a `CodingKeys` type already existed, the compiler just verifies that the case names line up with the property names, and that the referenced properties are `Codable`)
4.	If we’ve made it this far, the compiler is then able to insert an implementation for `init(from:)` or `encode(to:)` based on the properties listed in the `CodingKeys` enum: it iterates over the `CodingKeys` enum, finds the matching property with that name, and inserts an `encode(..., forKey: ...)` or `decode(..., forKey: ...)` call based on the type and name of the property


There is some amount of detail left out of this description, but that’s the gist. Because this is done in the compiler itself, there’s easy access to all types, names, and info the compiler already has about the code — the process is relatively straight-forward.

Happy to answer any questions you might have about the process/any other details that might be interesting. tl;dr, though: yes, without extending the Swift compiler itself, it’s currently not possible to add support for another protocol like this. With better metaprogramming features in the future (hygienic macros, or however it might eventually be named), we might be able to move the feature out of the compiler and into “regular” Swift code in the standard library, or similar.",1539099124.0

That's a strange claim.  Do you have any evidence for it?  Almost every program I see is drastically different from others written with similar or even identical specifications.

ssrij,"I used Firebase for an internal company project and this is what I did:

1.	Abstract away all Firebase related code using protocols: for example, I created a `DatastoreType` protocol that had the necessary methods to perform CRUD operations. I created another protocol, called `RealtimeDatastoreType` that extended `DatastoreType` to add functions for event listeners, for real-time updates. I also created an `AuthenticationType` protocol which had sign-in/sign-out functions and another function to detect if the user is signed in. Both these protocols had concrete implementations which used Firebase Firestore and Firebase Authentication respectively, which got injected into the view’s presenter as default parameters in the initialiser.
2.	Create a testable/mock class that implements the above protocols: for the data store, I created a `TestStore` class that used an in-memory array for the CRUD operations and allowed me to simulate the Firebase Firestore without using a real backend. For authentication, I created a `TestAuthentication` class, which simply logged the users in and out without performing real authentication.
3.	Inject the testable/mock class when a UI test is running: this is simple to do - you just have to set an environment variable when you run the tests and your app can read it whenever you inject your data store/authentication classes (via the views’ presenter’s initialiser, for example). This will allow your app to detect that it’s running a test and it can inject the testable/mock classes instead. This does mean you’re modifying “production” code to inject “test” classes, but it’s alright.

You don’t need to create a separate instance of the backend specifically for UI testing - you can simply use a mock for it. You can abstract things away using protocols and then swap the implementations when running tests. It also ensures that your UI tests pass even if Firebase is down.

TL;DR: Your app shouldn’t know anything about Firebase. It shouldn’t matter what the backend is - it could be AWS or something custom. Your app shouldn’t depend on a concrete implementation of a specific backend :) It should only know about a protocol. My app works exactly the same - regardless of whether I use Firebase, or AWS or test/mock classes (to simulate a backend).",1539045002.0

This code looks pretty rough:

Is there a reason you're using Any for the dictionary values? It would be  a lot cleaner to maybe make a struct, and store that as each dictionary value.

    struct MyInformation {
        let name: String
        ...

You don't need a custom initializer if TimeStamp is Codable. Then you would create a MyInformation instance:

    let myInfo = MyInformation(name: someNameValue, ...)
    var dict: [String: MyInformation] = [""Some Key"": myInfo]

Things to do: have specific functions to build ui and manipulate ui, verses getting data, and another set of methods to bind the two together.

Also, identify blocks of complex ui and make controls.  Even if they are only used once.  The same thing applies for breaking the functionality apart.

If you find you have common layout patterns, create helper methods for them.

A lot of this comes from years of building web content displays in JavaScript using JQuery.  People started to hate JQuery because you could easily create master methods that did everything in a single function (hundreds of lines long), which were impossible to maintain without heavy refactoring.

We still need master/controller methods, but they should be very short and easy to read, with other functions doing the messy heavy lifting.

sixtypercenttogether,"`JSONDecoder` is pretty strict about values like this. Assuming that the date property you are trying to decode is optional, an empty string represents an invalid value. A `null` value would be the correct representation.

You can work around this, but I think you'll need to implement your own `init(from:)` method. Also, `DateFormatter` is expensive to construct and configure, so you should not do so within the custom date formatting strategy closure, since it will be called many times.

* Connect to an API using URLSession
* Parse the results using Codable

* Implement Delegate and DataSource in an extension
* Use auto layouts to have automatically sizing cells
* Segue to the detail or edit screen by tapping the row

What's the API response look like?  You could always match that to keep some consistency between your back end and front end.  Otherwise, keeping two values in separate variables is fine and the default approach I'd take.  Especially if those variables are wrapped inside a struct.

If you're dealing with just that subset of the struct (start:Int, end:Int) often, passing it to functions and having it returned, then it might be worthwhile to wrap them in a named Tuple and assign it to a typeAlias:

    typeAlias UnorderedRange = (start: Int, end: Int)
 
And you can use it like this:

    let foo = UnorderedRange(start: 10, end: 1)

As others have mentioned you're unnecessarily (and without effect) setting your table view's frame. That's not the problem though.

You have an array of data, but the tableview doesn't know anything about it. You have to find a way to provide that information to the table view. Fortunately Apple has already provided a way to do that for you. Every UITableView has the ability to ask it's `dataSource` what it should show. From what you've posted, it looks like you haven't implemented the table view data source methods.  

At a minimum you need to ensure that your table view's data source is set and implement these two methods:

`func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int`

First of all, with `Codable` why bother creating your own system of encoding types? Write an appropriate encoder and every type can adhere to `Codable`. Secondly you’re stringifying all the things? You can simply use `JSONEncoder` or `PropertyListEncoder` to get a stringified encoded type. Even better, `PropertyListEncoder` can write in a binary format, saving quite a bit of resources. 

Lastly,

> we can create a solution that doesn’t rely on an enum existing somewhere with a list of keys 

Wait, what?? Using an `enum` is a *good* thing. You want to be able to accurately and easily map keys to values. With an `enum` you reduce bugs by ensuring your serialization API is codified and solid. It also doesn’t prohibit you from using arbitrary dictionaries or arrays of values. Oh, and it’s also automatically generated for you for free from your structure with `Codable`. 

Then, in the end, you create a complicated system of nested structures to hold your data when you could have just used ordinary model structures and `Codable`, avoiding a lot of boilerplate code for most operations.

andyweir,"Here's what I did:

I set the CanvasView bg color to black inside of its draw function. I figured that was appropriate due to the call to `setNeedsDisplay()` on its properties. I also figured it was appropriate because I'm thinking ""how can I make this reusable?"" If you want white drawing on a black background then setting the background should be in its draw function since that black background is a property of the view.

Inside the `ViewController's` `undo` function I set `theCurve` to `nil` right before `removeLast()`. The reason I did that is because in the `draw` function you have some logic like `if theCurve != nil then draw`. Well that's a problem if you plan on undoing. You set theCurve = to the current curve once you finish drawing a line. You don't set this to `nil` *after* you add it to the collection on `CanvasCurve`. This means `theCurve = current curve` is still going to be around once you remove it from the curve collection and that's why it still shows up after you undo

tl;dr : set `theCurve` to nil right before `removeLast` in the undo function. Also look into setting the `CanvasView` bg to black at the top of its `draw(rect:)` function ",1538531489.0

Saklad5,"I highly recommend looking into [Decodable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/decodable) for this. Trust me, it’s worth it. Make a struct that implements that protocol (which literally just means putting “: Decodable” after the struct name), then specify each variable according to the keys in the response. Nest structs for nested data (there are other ways to deal with nested data, but this seems like the appropriate approach here), and make sure each new struct implements Decodable.

&#x200B;

`struct WeatherResponse: Decodable`

`{`

`struct Weather: Decodable`

`{`

`let id: Int`

`let main: String`

`let description: String`

`}`

`let coord: [String: Double]`

`let weather: Weather`

`}`

&#x200B;

If all the variable types *also* implement Decodable (and things like Strings and Ints do), then you don’t have to write an initializer. It’ll automatically figure out what you want. It even works with dictionaries, arrays, and sets, as long as the keys and values are still Decodable!

&#x200B;

Then you just feed it Data and it creates an instance of your struct. If you are trying to decode a JSON stored in a Data variable called “result"" into a struct called “WeatherResponse”, it’ll look like this:

`try JSONDecoder().decode(WeatherResponse.self, from: result)`

&#x200B;

If you want your variables to have different names than the response keys, you WILL have to provide an initializer, but that is actually just a matter of decoding each variable in the same way.

Core Data and other database storage options are often safer, faster, easier, and more reliable than storing stuff on your own in the filesystem.

So what you need to do is include the swift header file in the obc-c file you wish to work on. This is not to be confused with the bridging header you made to go from objc to swift. This is a hidden file that xcode handles for you. It will be called {projectName}-Swift.h.

Note you may get errors or warnings that the file cannot be found do a clean and then build and it should go away.

Lastly in an objc file you can not write the code as swift when you call the function you need to write it how you would call an objc method but it will call your swift code.

That is it. It isn't really hard but the finicky nature of it makes it a pain and sometimes you just have to fight through it and trust that you are doing it right. I hope this helps.

Using `!` says ""We have an `Optional` but it's a special one that should always be set to a value and never `nil`, so unwrap it for me automatically.""

    let foo: Int? = 10 // regular Optional
    let bar: Int! = 10 // implicitly-unwrapped Optional
    print(foo) // Warning about Optional value, prints ""Optional(10)""
    print(bar) // Automatically unwraps, no warning, prints ""Optional(10)""

You can safely unwrap an `Optional` with a pattern like this:

    if let fooUnwrapped = foo {
      // fooUnwrapped is the unwrapped value
    }

If `foo` was set to `nil` then the `if let` statement wouldn't execute the stuff in the brackets.

You can also throw all caution to the wind and force-unwrap it with `!`. If the variable is `nil` then you'll get a crash.

    let foo: Int? = nil
    let bar: Int = foo! // Boom! crash

hitoyoshi,"I think the key thing to remember about optionals is that – despite the shorthand `?` and `!` syntax, they are actually another type. 

Specifically, they're an enum defined as:

    enum Optional <T> {
        case some(T)
        case none
    }

So as you can see, an Optional can be one of two values, `none` which contains nothing, and `some` which contains a wrapped type `T`. (The `T` in angled brackets means its generic, which means we can have an `Optional` contain *any* type we want – Optional <Int>, Optional <String>, Optional <MyCrazyClass> – whatever.

Some people find it helpful to think of these kind of types as 'boxes' – because they wrap another type of some kind.

At they're root they are just standard enums – If you understand what an enum can do you understand what an Optional type can do. (Swift enums are pretty powerful.)

What can be confusing is that as Optional is a type used so heavily throughout the language, Swift includes shorthand for Optionals such as the `?` and `!' operators – strictly you don't need this kind of syntactic sugar to work with them though – and in fact I think it's helpful to understand how you'd work without the sugar so you can really understand them

For example, any type which is followed by a question mark `T?` could also be written as `Optional <T>`.

Let's take a method which takes an optional Int (`Optional <Int>` or `Int?`) and doubles it and write it using regular enum syntax:

    func doubleBoxedInt(_ boxedInt: Optional <Int>) -> Optional <Int> {
        guard case let .some(unboxedInt) = boxedInt else {
            // the box was empty, return empty box
            return .none
        }
        // we have the unboxed value, double it and return the value doubled and boxed
        return .some(unboxedInt * 2)
    }

In their wisdom though, the designers of Swift thought that might become tiresome so they added a bit of sugar so that an `Optional <T>` could be represented as a `T?` and also some magic so that if an optional is expected somewhere, the compiler will wrap the value in a `some()` on your behalf. It also allows an 'unboxing' with a simple `if let` or`guard let`, and of course `nil` is synonymous with `.none`. So that the above can be written as:

    func doubleBoxedInt(_ boxedInt: Int?) -> Int? {
        guard let unboxedInt = boxedInt else {
            // the box was empty, do nothing
            return nil
        }
        // we have the unboxed value, double it and return
        return (unboxedInt * 2)
    }

The important thing to remember is that an optional is an Optional <T>. And an Optional <T> is an enum. Understand enums, and you understand Optionals.",1538408685.0
DeigoCaab,"Optionals are values that might have a value or might be nil. A question mark means you're passing an optional value somewhere. But if you have a piece of code that uses the value you're gonna have to ""unwrap"" your optional. So there are different methods to get the value out safely, and you can decide what to do after you get the value or you find a nil. Do try is for error throwing, don't worry about that part. Look into methods of unwrapping optionals. ""!"" Is just the least safe method of unwrapping, it's just saying force out whatever was in there.

",1538405722.0
PayJay,"First of all, from one guy who gets too excited and has been known to make inflammatory posts like this to another, let’s take a chill pill. 

So, Swift is an infant compared to PHP, ObjC, C#. If you think they are done changing things you’ve assumed wrong. 

It’s an open source language, so if you’re going to yell at someone, yell at everyone making merge requests for it when they find a way to improve the syntax or functionality or readability. 

Getting frustrated over tutorials that are out of date: ya, I will admit this is frustrating. But that’s the life, ya know? Sometimes you get lucky and Xcode automatically suggests the updated code, sometimes you gotta keep searching. I don’t find that to be unique to swift at all, I’m my experience. 

I recently wrote my first iPhone app, and this was my first experience with swift. I have training in C++, Python, java and more, and jumping right in to a swift project with barely any knowledge of the syntax was actually relatively very easy to me. It should be even more so for you coming from an objective c background, whereas swift is based on that language. Yeah a lot of the tutorials I borrowed from had outdated code. 90% of the time the solution is just one additional google search away.

The entire point of swift is to be streamlined and as easy as possible to read, interpret, and use. It will continue to be updated to that end. 

I still don’t understand the optionals but I got through it and hacked together an app that does exactly what I set out to do. If you lack determination, software development isn’t for you. These are opportunities to learn, not obstacles. 

It’s the fastest growing language worldwide. I’d say you better get familiar. Don’t give up. You can do it. Kids are doing it. 

It’s all good brother/sister. Deep breath. YouTube is your fiend. Next time you feel like watching TV put on some videos about swift development. There are thousands. I’m going to go watch one right now on optionals. ",1538406301.0
b_t_s,"Optionals are just like obj-c pointers...they might be nill and if you don't check you might crash your app.   But swift _forces_ you to check, gives you some nicer syntax to check, and gives you tools at the type level to keep track of what you've already.  Whereas in obj-c we mostly just hoped.  And optionals haven't changed since swift2 except for minor improvements like more slightly more flexible if lets, so your optional trouble are not a swift version thing they're a swift thing. Here's basically everything you need to know about optionals, with descriptions, and  obj-c translations.

    
    var foo: Foo?   // an optional Foo.   You will have to deal with the optionality
    // Foo *foo

    var foo: Foo!   // an implicitly unwrapped optional Foo.   You won't have to deal with the optionality in the rest of your code, but you better populate it before you use it or crash.
    // Foo *foo

    foo?.bar()   // if foo is nil that's OK, just don't do anything after the ?
    //[foo bar];

    foo!.bar()   // if foo is nil crash
    //assert(foo != nil); [foo bar];
    //This may look odd because obj-c defaults to no-ops on messaging nil objects but it's the behavior you'd get using the pointer to access an ivar in obj-c
    // foo->_somePropertyOfFoo //this crashes in obj-c if foo is nil

    let baz = foo ??  getAnotherFoo()     //baz will be the first one that's not nil(and optional or not depending on whether getAnotherFoo returns a Foo or a Foo?)
    // Foo* baz =  foo ?: getAnotherFoo() 

    //try to make a new foo that isn't optional and shadows the old optional one inside this if block
    if let foo = foo { 
        foo.bar()
    }
    // if (foo != nil) {
    //     [foo bar]; 
    // }


    //try to make a new foo that isn't optional and shadows the old optional one for the rest of this method
    guard let foo = foo else { return } 
    foo.bar()
    // if (foo == nil) { return; }
    // [foo bar];

    

That's pretty much all you need to know about optionals. They can be annoying at first but they drive you to write better code by pushing dependencies into init methods, trying to eliminate optionals that shouldn't really be optional, and making it clear what can and can't be nill.

Optionals are invented to let us handle **nil** at ease. If the variable can contain nil value, its type must be accompanied by `?` , eg: `String?`.

`if let a = b` is equivalent to

    if b != nil {
      a = b!
    }

The `try catch` is a bit more complicated, you use a try-catch block when the function might throw an error during runtime (eg: the JSONDecoder function will throw an error is the JSON input is invalid).

`let car = try? JSONDecoder().decode(Car.self, from: data)` will return a car object if the JSON data is successfully parsed. If the JSON data is invalid, an error will be thrown from the .decode function, then `try?` will ignore the error and assign a nil value to car.

`try?` is used when you don't care about the error handling.

Monitor addiction is real...",1538089546.0
satysin,"I used to swear by a second monitor as a huge productivity gain until I worked with a developer who was easily the most productive guy I had ever known and he worked with a single monitor. I asked him how he did it and he told me how he used to have several monitors. First he went to 2 then 3 and finally 4. Then he went back to one by changing how he worked to be more efficient. He realises he was more productive when he was more focused and a single screen allowed him to focus on one thing. I decided to try and imitate his workflow for a while and never looked back. Life just got simpler with a single screen. It is hard to explain and it is painful for the first few weeks but then it just kinda clicked for me. I could get and stay in “the zone” way easier and my neck and eye strain went away as I wasn’t always making small motions to look either side. 

Not saying it works for everyone but I don’t think I could go back to multiple monitors. 

Also I looked into all the major studies about productivity gains for multiple monitors and saw a common theme. They were all paid for or sponsored by companies that would benefit from saying more monitors is best.

I like to think of the online tutorials like baking recipes, if you follow the recipe you’ll end up with a cake but you still won’t know how to make one yourself... that comes with practice and learning all the smaller pieces.

Without an iPad and swift playgrounds (which is great if you have one) what I do is find a tutorial and follow it through until the end. Then no matter  how much I understand it I try to redo it myself with out the tutorial and figure it out... then when that doesn’t work I refer to the tutorial to see where it went wrong, how to fix it and do it over again and again until I can build the tutorial app without the tutorial... then on to the next tutorial and start over again.

2. learn the basics of Swift then start making apps, skip all the mid and advanced stuff till you are further along.  There's a LOT you can do before you get into closures or extensions.

4. try to find tutorials that aren't ""watch me type, and type what I type...""   NOBODY needs a typing lesson in a programming tutorial.

BUT most importantly I would say just get coding. 

The best way to learn any language, and to learn how to program is to practice. Choose a small project such as a table view which you can add items to, or something hopefully more related to the app you are trying to build and build it. At the beginning it will be tricky, you will get a lot of errors, and things may not look the way you want. However, keep in mind it is just going to get easier the more you do it. 

If you start building an app to practice, just dive into it. For example: Choose a starting point such as creating a table view, then google ""How do I add an item to a table view programatically in swift."" And continue on building your app until you feel comfortable enough to embark on a more advanced project.

Core data is useable with swift. Insanely well if I don’t say so myself.


The parts that require @objc annotations are there because core data utilizes NSCoding for serialization between the SQLite data store and the runtime classes.


Swift enums are not able to be represented in core data (as far as I know), but my approach to using codable structs with core data is to have a model type which has a strong unique identifier and a transformable data attribute which has a class type of NSDictionary<String, Any>, which I serialize to and from for codables.

cyanisaac,"Just skimming the article, half of these ""bugs"" aren't even bugs, they're issues with support mechanisms. Some of the solutions aren't even unique, they just refer to other solutions and mitigations. One of the issues you had was even something like improper training/teaching documentation, which can be found across pretty much all such documentation, including Apple's and Google's. Why do you expect perfection from Snap?

>	Some of the bugs documented below are nit-picky, however, Snap is in no position to allow even the slightest developer friction to occur. Snap’s future is partly riding on the success of Snap Kit, and the business has very little wiggle room to get things wrong. Winning over the developer community is paramount to Snap Kit SDK adoption.

I think that holding one of the most used social networking apps is a good enough incentive for developers to use a slightly wonky SDK. Other companies have shit-tier SDKs that people use because the features are worthwhile. If you want the features of SnapKit, something tells me you’ll be motivated to work through SDK issues. Obviously it’s ideal to have a cleaner SDK, but at the end of the day, it’s more about what functionality the SDK provides. Developers are plenty motivated to use shoddy SDKs for functionality (see iOS, Android, or pretty much any SDK)

>	Also, some of these could be considered feature requests, documentation requests or things that are “not bugs”. As someone with 20 years of software industry experience, I say these are “FAILURES” that need to be addressed (aka Bugs).

Good to know one person’s opinion on the internet has deemed issues with a project as “FAILURES.” This makes all the difference.

Have you seen what kind of bugs get left in software? You should know with “20 years of software industry experience” that minor issues and even major issues will crop up in software. I’m not even into my professional career yet (starting college) and I well understand that. There’s also what issues should be prioritized - what if there are other issues that are more impactful to other people than the ones you have presented?

And that’s just software issues. Customer support is even worse sometimes. Have you seen how Google supports content creators on YouTube?

>	Snap’s release of Snap Kit is faulty in almost every conceivable aspect

Really? What is your overall experience with features? You gave 16 distinct issues and half of them were for support. If that’s all you’ve ran into, then that SDK sounds pretty damn good. I’ve had loads of issues with Apple’s SDKs that have fundamentally locked me off from approaching certain app designs (such as tab bar controllers not working with split view controllers) or have caused hair-tearing issues (iOS 11 had my app crashing because I had named a class with View at the end when it was not a view - bad naming, but iOS tried performing a selector on it without validation, causing a crash).

Yet, for all that it’s worth, the iOS SDK also has provided a pretty good experience that has made it easier for me as a beginner to create software for the platform. I’ve worked with iOS for about three years now, and I’m looking forward to likely making it my career in about four.

You can name specific issues but the lack of your experience overall doesn’t justify calling it faulty in every conceivable aspect. That’s just clickbait. Maybe your other ten Medium articles would lend more perspective, but frankly I’m not particularly driven to read them after reading this.

For example, in an iOS app, you must assign it in the application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) or application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) method of your app delegate. Assigning a delegate after these methods are called might cause you to miss incoming notifications.

  Essentially you receive the notification before your view controller initializes that's why you are missing them. You either have to assign another object as a delegate (a singleton manager for example) and initialize it on app launch or use the

ssrij,"Adding an extension to the view controller merely “hides” the code. Your view controller is still doing two things - acting as a view & a controller.

You can separate the code into different classes, which would be much better. Your view should only be responsible for one thing - displaying content. Everything else should be handled by the controller and the model.

You can add other classes as well - for example, you can create a Navigator class for handling navigation.

So for example: your view controller will contain an instance of your controller class (maybe via dependency injection?) and your view controller will ask its controller to do some stuff (say load some data over the network then parse and format it). The controller will perform the job (either directly or by offloading it to a different class, say a `NetworkManager` class) and then once it has the data, the controller will call a method on your view controller (say, `displayTableViewItems(withContent content: [Data])`) to display the content. Your view will be responsible for properly laying out the data in whichever way you want.

So you still have a `UIViewController`, but it’s not *controlling* anything. It’s only displaying content that’s passed to it by its controller (a separate class).

    // ApplicationServices is a singleton, because it makes it easier to be accessed from anywhere to access its functions/services

That's already two too many singletons. Yes, they can be useful but why do we need them? Singletons can also be dangerous – difficult to debug and tricky to maintain. Are we keeping state around? I mean, the only state I see in `ApplicationServices` is:

    let appRouter = ApplicationRouter()

Which is already a singleton, right? So why are we instantiating it if it's already easily available? Similarly, in `ApplicationRouter`:

    var instantiatedModules: [ModuleType] = [PaymentModule(),
                                             LoginModule()]

You say that like it's a benefit, and for most types of apps, it is, but software development is different.

You say ""basically the core objective for us is to enable even people without development experience create and maintain UI tests"", but writing a line of code was never the limiting factor.  Non-programmers learn HTML without too much trouble.  The syntax is never the hard part.

Do you have a bunch of non-programmers who want to create and maintain UI tests?  Have you done user testing with actual programming teams, to tell if this works in practice?  Do these non-programmers work with programmers during new development (and if so, doesn't that just shift the burden back to a programmer)?  Why wouldn't a team just hire (or train) people for the job they're doing?  Does this increase productivity, overall, for people who already understand UI testing?  Of all the jobs that require programming skill today, why did you pick this one to try to give to non-programmers?

If the amount of data you’re needing to persist is substantial at all, I’d recommend looking at other options — NSCoding/Codable for serializing to disk are great for for small to moderate amounts of data and for huge volumes you may want to consider Core Data, SQLite + wrapper (YapDatabase, FMDB, etc), Realm, or one of the other many database solutions.",1537400998.0

So the Session object gets read from UserDefaults the first time you access it and every changes afterwards happens to the Session object in-memory and gets written to UserDefaults afterwards. This ensures you always get the right value even if you read immediately after writing. Also, it can make your application slightly faster as reading and writing from and to disk are like a few orders of a magnitude slower than accessing the RAM.

divadretlaw,"When reusing cells you need to make sure to set everything again. This is because when you are reusing a cell all the values stay the same (with some exceptions)

For example you set the `senderbubbleBgView` to hidden.

```
cell.senderbubbleBgView.isHidden = true
```

But when a cell is reused it will stay hidden even if you did not set it for this cell explicitly. When scrolling up and down cells get reused. But on other cells `bubbleBgView` will be hidden.

```
cell.bubbleBgView.isHidden = true
```

Therefore you have to explicitly unhide these views when you need them to be not hidden.

This should fix the issue

	cell.bubbleBgView.isHidden = false

How deep are you in the job process, have they made an actual offer, have you done the onsite interview?

If you already have the offer, then I wouldn't worry about it.  If you're in the interview process, but they haven't made an off yet, I'd just submit the app under someone else's account.

1. get an answer from Apple

**edit:**

Interestingly enough this doesn't work! I typed it up and wasn't able to verify it at the time. Apparently the default `DateFormatter` can read a date from a string but can't write one to a string. This works:

    let date = Date()
    let formatter = DateFormatter()
    let dateString = ""\(date)"" // formatter.string(from: date) does not work!
    let date2 = formatter.date(from: dateString) // works

It appears that you would need this to have it work both ways:

    var formatter = DateFormatter()
    formatter.dateFormat = ""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z""
    let dateString = formatter.string(from: date)
    print(""\(date)"")  // 2018-09-15 21:25:33 +0000
    print(dateString) // 2018-09-15 17:25:33 -0400

Note that the printed times are the same time with the offset of the first one set to 0. That's because `Date` is stored internally without an offset. `DateFormatter` uses the local `TimeZone` and `Locale` when it's created.

While the Flux architecture is abstract, explaining Flask is easy:

**Flask lets you Mix Substances and React to their State Changes**

Easy right?

As such to preserve this natural intuition Flux Stores are called a Substance. In Flask a Substance would represent any homogeneous data structure in your application (ie. a feed, settings, or the application itself).

Flask allows implementing both the Redux and Fluxor patterns through a unified architecture. And although this may sound involved it's also easy to explain:

**Flask lets you create ReactiveSubstances that react to environmental events called Mixers as well as plain Substances meant to be Mixed inside a particular Flask.**

This is a direct analogy between the Fluxor pattern of Reactive Stores as a ReactiveSubstance and the Redux pattern of Store Reducers as a plain Substance.

**Motivation**

Flask should deliver the most robust feature set accessible through the most friendly API.

With this in mind, Flask goes beyond the novelty of this architecture to develop an expressive API borrowing semantics from elemental science creating a framework that is easy to understand through analogies of the physical world.

All this while the core technology offers a unified implementation of both the Redux and Fluxor patterns while delivering advanced features not available in other frameworks (such as locks and nested keys reduction).

**Why Flask?**

Flask provides unique features not found in similar frameworks:

* Chain Reactions
* Binding multiple stores
* Reduce changes with nested keys
* Flux locks and exclusive dispatch
* Automatic archiving to UserDefaults
* Managed attachments with automatic disposal
* Friendly high-level API
* Access to low-level API for more granular control
* Mixed use of both Redux and Fluxor patterns

**CocoaPods**

If you use CocoaPods to manage your dependencies, simply add Flask to your Podfile:

    pod 'Flask'

And then import the module

    import Flask

** Chain Reaction Gist**

   
        GetFlaskReactor(at:self)
            .toMix(self.substance) { (substance) in
                
                //local substance
                substance.prop.counter = 10
                
            }.with(Subs.appReactive) { (substance) in
                
                //global substance
                substance.prop.counter = 1000
                
            }.andReact()

codytwinton,"# Dependency Inversion

Dependency Inversion (aka Dependency Injection) is sometimes summed up in what's known as the Hollywood Principle:

> Don't call us. We'll call you.

I think the reason that this doesn't quite make sense is that the article wasn't as clear as it could have been. Here's some further, clearer examples & implementations of this principle.

**Protocol**

Swift is a Protocol Oriented Programming language, so first, we create a protocol:

```swift
protocol DatabaseService {
  func getUsers()-> [User]
}
```

**Implementation**

This can be conformed to by any implementation. We'll use Core Data first:

```swift
class CoreDataService: DatabaseService {
  func getUsers() -> [User] {
    // fetch users from core data and return
  }
}
```

And Realm second:

```swift
class RealmService: DatabaseService {
  func getUsers() -> [User] {
    // fetch users from core data and return
  }
}
```

**View Controller**

This is where my example differs and implements a better example of dependency inversion. Basically, our View Controller ""depends"" on having an instance of a `DatabaseService` so that it can get Users. So, here's how we would implement this:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {

  let databaseService: DatabaseService

  // ...

  init(databaseService: DatabaseService) {
    self.databaseService = databaseService
    super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
  }

  // ...

  func showMyUsers() {
    let users = databaseService.getUsers()
    // do something with the users
  }
}
```

This way, your ViewController has no idea about implementation, and it doesn't need to. Your view doesn't care if it's Core Data or Realm or a cloud data cache... it merely cares about the ability to ""get users"".

**Inverting the Dependency**

Finally, you create your View Controller:

```swift
func someFunc() {
  let databaseService = CoreDataService()
  let controller = ViewController(databaseService: databaseService)
  
  // present your view controller
}
```

Ever wanna change implementations? Change 1 line of code:

```swift
func someFunc() {
  let databaseService = RealmService()
  let controller = ViewController(databaseService: databaseService)
  
  // present your view controller
}
```

Now, you have true dependency inversion. Your View Controller never determines the implementation of its dependency.

**Conclusion**

So, your view controller depends on having an instance of a `DatabaseService`, which is implemented by either your `CoreDataService` or `RealmService`. It's more of a linear abstraction, rather than circular:

```
UIViewController ->
    DatabaseService ->
        CoreDataService or RealmService
```",1536726789.0
Aeather,"Honestly, I read that article and it is confusing as all hell. There is definitely better resources out there that I will link at the bottom of this post.

The idea of Dependency Inversion is to rely on abstractions not concrete classes.

For example say you have a class that's only responsibility is to fetch users from a database. For the sake of this example we will use the ActiveRecord design pattern.


     class DatabaseFetcher {

     let coreDatabase: CoreDatabase

     init(coreDatabase: CoreDatabase) {
     self.coreDatabase = coreDatabase
       }

     func fetchUsers() -> [Users] {
     // do stuff with the coreDatabase object
     
        }
     }


in your VC you call it as such

    let coreDatabase = CoreDatabase()
    let databaseFetcher = DatabaseFetcher(coreDatabase: coreDatabase)
    let users = databaseFetcher.fetchUsers()


Your boss called, he want's to switch to Realm! WOHOO, but that means you have to go back and refactor your code to use Realm instead of Core Data. This is a tedious and also what if he wants to switch back to Core data at some point? So how to we accomplish making a reusable class that can accept different types of databases?

Protocol Oriented Programming

What do we want our databases to have? We want them to have a fetchUsers function. So we create the protocol

    protocol Fetchable {
    func execute() -> [Users]
    }

    class CoreDatabase: Fetchable {
    func execute() -> [Users]{
    // implement the functionality here
    }
    }

    class RealmDatabase: Fetchable {
    func execute() -> [Users]{
    // implement the functionality here
    }
    }

Then we create the DatabaseFetcher class

     class DatabaseFetcher {

     let database: Fetchable

     init(database: Fetchable ) {
     self.database = database
       }

     func fetchUsers() -> [Users] {
     // We know that the database confirms to the protocol Fetchable which has the function execute()
     return database.execute()
        }
     }

in our VC we call

    let realmDatabase = RealmDatabase()
    let databaseFetcher = DatabaseFetcher(database: realmDatabase)
    let users = databaseFetcher.fetchUsers()

What if we had core database instead?

    let coreDatabase = CoreDatabase()
    let databaseFetcher = DatabaseFetcher(database: coreDatabase )
    let users = databaseFetcher.fetchUsers()
    

The database fetcher class accepts objects that have implemented the Fetchable protocol. As long as the class conforms to that protocol it can fetchUsers. In doing this you decouple the classes, you are not relying on concrete classes and functions. You can use the open/closed principle as well.

JimDabell,"It's because UIKit was designed before Swift / optionals and it doesn't really mesh 100% with them.

You can think of view controllers and views as having two separate setup stages.  First, the object is initialised, then all the outlets are hooked up.  Once all that is done, `viewDidLoad()` is called and you know your view controller / view is set up completely.

Swift doesn't work this way.  Non-optional properties need to have a value assigned to them by the time the object has finished being initialised, by definition.  There's no *""hang on a minute while I deserialise the storyboard/nib""*, you *need* all the values assigned before then.

Because of this, outlets *have* to be optional, because they start out as `nil`.  But that doesn't really fit with how outlets are usually used, where there's the assumption that there will always be a value (because you're expecting it to come from the storyboard / nib).  So the usual solution is to use implicitly unwrapped optionals to continue that assumption without having to deal with the possibility of `nil` everywhere you access an outlet.

It's certainly not ideal, but it's probably the least bad approach to take with outlets.  If you want to, you can use normal optionals and handle the `nil` case everywhere, or you could assert that all of your implicitly unwrapped optionals have values in `viewDidLoad()` and write a SwiftLint plugin to ensure you don't miss any.

I suspect that further down the line, whatever replaces UIKit will be more Swift-friendly and will act more like `Codable` where you can deserialise without everything being optional.",1536750155.0

Haydenmccabe,"Primarily, it comes from the requirements for initializing an object in Swift, which adds complications when working with certain elements of UIKit (which is based on Objective-C.) The local properties, which reference objects in the XIB, can not be standard variables or constants (i.e., defined by just var or let) because they would have to be referenced during the initialization of the object, which is not possible because of the way UIKit works at runtime. That leaves optional and implicitly unwrapped optional references. Of those, the IUO is simply easier because you don’t have to reference it *as* an optional in the rest of your code. There is, of course, the risk of a runtime failure, but so long as UIKit correctly ties your reference to the object in the XIB, you’re good to go.

thisischemistry,"`Int` adopts `SignedInteger` which inherits from `BinaryInteger` which inherits from [`CustomStringConvertable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/customstringconvertible):

> Types that conform to the `CustomStringConvertible` protocol can provide their own representation to be used when converting an instance to a string. The `String(describing:)` initializer is the preferred way to convert an instance of any type to a string. If the passed instance conforms to `CustomStringConvertible`, the `String(describing:)` initializer and the `print(_:)` function use the instance’s custom description property.

If you command-click on `joined(separator:)` and select ""Jump to definition"" you see this:

    extension Array where Element == String {
    
        /// Returns a new string by concatenating the elements of the sequence,
        /// adding the given separator between each element.
        ///
        /// The following example shows how an array of strings can be joined to a
        /// single, comma-separated string:
        ///
        ///     let cast = [""Vivien"", ""Marlon"", ""Kim"", ""Karl""]
        ///     let list = cast.joined(separator: "", "")
        ///     print(list)

        ///
        /// - Parameter separator: A string to insert between each of the elements

        /// - Returns: A single, concatenated string.
        public func joined(separator: String = default) -> String
    }

So there is an extension of `Array` specially written for `String`. That's what you're calling.

So lets do the same thing:

    import Foundation

    var x = [1,2,3]

    extension Array where Element: CustomStringConvertible {
      public func stringRepresentation(separator: String = """") -> String {
        return self.map{ $0.description }.joined(separator: "","")
      }
    }

    print(x.map{ String($0)}.joined(separator: "","")) // prints 1,2,3
    print(x.stringRepresentation(separator: "",""))    // prints 1,2,3

It seems like most of the `Numeric` types adopt `CustomStringConvertible` so that covers them too.

    print([1.0,2.0,3.0].stringRepresentation(separator: "",""))    // prints 1.0,2.0,3.0

You could even do this but I don't really recommend it since the default description can get ugly in some cases:

    extension Array where Element: Numeric {
      public func stringDescribing(separator: String = """") -> String {
        return self.map{ String(describing: $0) }.joined(separator: "","")

Or, any extension on Numeric that String.init() can work with, like:

    extension Numeric: LosslessStringConvertible {
      public init?(_ description: String) {
        // ??
      }
    }

Or maybe, all you really want is this: 

    extension Array where Element: LosslessStringConvertible {

I would suggest writing a routine that tracks what element (cell) is actively shown on the screen.

&#x200B;

Example: I wanted a horizontal scroll picker that had an enlarged center item.  Say you had 10 items on a horizontal scroller, one would be in the center and that one would be 2X the size of the others.  What I had in mind wasn't self scrolling, but that wouldn't be a big deal to change.

I have already integrated your recommendations and released an update v0.2.11. I really appreciate your help.

As the concerns are similar I'll reply here:

* About Utility
There is no way to create a debounce,  idle or watchTimer with Apple Class. You need to more boilerplate just to restart the timer in its basic form.

* API Feedback
Also just updated the labels based on your feedback `timeOut: key: context` and submitted a new cocoapod available now.

* About Sample Code:
The code samples are bad. I wrote them on the markdown editor and without  doing all the optional unwrapping. I am  already advanced with swift digging around generics (and also have a strong engineering background coming from C and obj-C) but this is my first public Pod so yeah, I need to learn to write proper examples etc. I appreciate your observations.

If you are certain it's not a streaming body (99% of POST requests) you can use `syncDecode` which will return a non-future:

```
let data = req.content.syncDecode(AmtrakData.self)
```

Alternatively you can use the request handler sugar to do it for you when you register the route  

```swift
router.post(AmtrakData.self, at: ""someRoute"", use: check)
```

This passes in the decoded data as a second parameter to the route handler:

```swift
func check(_ req: Request, data: AmtrakData) -> String {
  print(data.email)
  print(data.password)
  return ""Returning a String""

CodeWithChris,"Hey congratulations! That's an accomplishment on it's own, because most people struggle to find the time or commitment to get to the end.

My recommendation would be to get in as many demos and app tutorials as you can. At this point, you probably have an understanding of how things are put together but you also need to expose yourself to more ""experiences"". By getting more hands on practice, you'll expose yourself to a variety of app architectures, navigation techniques, design patterns, data and networking techniques etc, all of which will build up a pool of skills/techniques for you to rely on.

After building up this pool of experience, you'll be more confident and have a better idea of how to go about building your dream app. (If you feel like you know enough to build your dream app right now, then by all means, do it!!). I find that having that pool of experience makes it very easy to look at something and say, ""Hey i've done something similar before, i can just adapt it to build this new thing""

What you can do is break this down to a step by step of exactly what to do.  As if you were explaining it to someone that never programmed before...

&#x200B;

I like to make notes where I have the topic, a quick summary and a step by step of everything needed so that you really can't screw things up.

&#x200B;

You do this with all the sub parts of a project, like the protocol stuff linked above, then you have say 10 parts with 1\~5 steps in each sub part.

&#x200B;

Point: it's one thing to say ""I've completed the course..."" it's another thing to say that you can complete the project without any help from anything other than some notes you've made.

It's pretty easy to get caught up in just reading code that is ready made, however, in the real world it's not always like that.

It's true that in the real world, you can grab code from GitHub, put it into your project and never look at the actual code or how it does what it does.  Just as much as you can trust that Apple's ARKit does what it's supposed to do without you ever seeing under the hood, you can do the same with all the 3rd party stuff out there...

        self.amount = Decimal(sign: significand < 0 ? .minus : .plus,

You will also need to consider how the website is built. If you want to use the same data, you'll need to know about the current back end. Is there a rest API you can use, for example.

I tend to keep them inside that file unless:

* An enum grows to more than 40 lines of code

blaizedm,"Since no one has given a serious answer: 

Cocoapods builds the dependencies when you build your project. Including cocoapods means you have to use a workspace with all of your dependencies added as separate projects in the workspace, and anytime you make a clean build (or archive) you have to rebuild them all. 

Carthage checks out the source code and builds the frameworks independently of your project. You then add them to your project and include a script to copy them in properly. It's a much more desynchronized process. 

Cocoapods is more widely supported and used, and is much simpler to use in most cases. Supporting a cocoapods framework is a bit of a pain in the ass, and including it in your project kind of mutilates your project structure with the workspace and build phases. 

Carthage is a one-and-done process, where once youve built the dependencies you're good until you need to update one. The downside being it takes forever to build them all the first time and there's a bunch of manual set up you have to include.

__Diesel__,"I would write an application in Swift that talks to the API. 

From reading other comments it sounds like you should research what the API is. Is it a RESTful API? If so you will find many tutorials on how to do it. I would really not want to add Ruby to my iOS program just because I know it. Learn swift, I really enjoy it. 

The first time I worked with APIs I didn’t understand the concept of what it was. The API should have documentation on how to query it. It’s just a web address that responds to GET, POST, etc formatted in the proper way. For example a GET request with certain information in the body (likely in JSON) to get a response. It should be laid out in the documentation how that looks. Then you figure out how to do that in your language. Now I’m describing a restful API. I guess some crazy person could have you send a 1 for every color until you hit the right one (1 is blue, 11 is green, 111 is purple) on port 994949 without http on a socket... but they should still have documentation on how to form that message (I used sockets for my first server and app before I knew Django)

shitidiotturtle,"Something that _might_ be worth the effort depending on the code base is adding a unit type (there is one in Foundation now I think, but this could easily be added in Swift), e.g. 

    struct Unit<U>: Comparable, ExpressibleByFloatLiteral {
        typealias FloatLiteralType = Float
    
        var value: Float
    
        init(floatLiteral value: Float) {
            self.value = value

            return lhs.value == rhs.value
        }

The main benefit of this being that if you create a `kCal` and `Gram` unit value you can't accidentally compare them, or use them in the wrong place in the calculation, e.g. 

    let weight: Unit<Gram> = 1.0
    let energy: Unit<kCal> = 1.0
    
    print(weight == energy) //compiler error thanks to the phantom type

where this would compile fine but could lead to bugs 

    typealias GramAlias = Float
    typealias kCalAlias = Float

    let otherEnergy: kCalAlias = 1.0

lanzaio,"I REALLY don't like `typealias`es who do nothing other than rename something like `Double` to `Gram`. There's literally nothing gained from that layer of indirection. At the BARE MINIMUM you should make a `struct Gram` that conforms to `ExpressibleBy{Integer,Float}Literal` and add necessary utility methods to it. If you can't think of a method that would ease in the usage of `Gram` then it should just be a `Double`. 

Having a `typealias Gram = Double` hints at stricter typing rules than actually exists. 
    
    typealias Gram = Double
    typealias Age = Double
    struct Person {

JerenYun,"Delegation is a way to have another class manage responses from something that conforms to a specific protocol. Presumably you’re looking at an example similar to the `UITableViewDelegate` protocol. 

A class can declare that they confirm to that protocol. This means that they have to implement the details of that protocol. In this case, it says that this class can act as a table view’s delegate. 

Now, your table view is looking for something that can act as that delegate. The table view will call this delegate for certain things, such as when a user taps on a row. The delegate is expected to conform to a certain protocol, hereby defining the actions that delegate needs to support. 

So when you set `.delegate = self`, you are saying that self (the current class) conforms to the protocol and can perform the required functionality that delegate is expecting. In the above example, you’d be saying that your class can act as a table view delegate and respond to certain actions accordingly. It references the existing class, not creating a new one. 

That said, if you had a different class that conformed to that protocol, such as `SampleDelegateClass`, you could set a new instance of it as the delegate. `.delegate = SampleDelegateClass()`

&#x200B;

First thing you need to understand is the concept of delegates/data sources (read up on that). Sounds like you never worked with UI, which is why things are so confusing for you.

&#x200B;

Every UI element on the screen needs information in your code to know what it's supposed to do. When you add UICollection to your controller, it will need to know:

1. How many sections to display (datasource)
2. How many items to display in each section (datasource)
3. What every single cell is supposed to display (datasource)
4. What happens when user taps on the cell (delegate)
5. etc etc etc

Your view controller needs to be able to provide all of that information to the view. You announce to your UI that the particular controller can do that by adding protocols to it's definition.

&#x200B;

Once you add `:UICollectionViewDelegate, UICollectionViewDataSource` to your controller, compiler will prompt you to add required methods - things your CollectionView can't render itself without. Just follow the prompts. 

&#x200B;

After that, once you feel you need some more rendering information/feedback from your UI element, you Google it :) I feel that reading Apple documentation can be enlightening , but also overwhelming to new users. Their examples will have lots of things you don't care about, but they will confuse you even more.

> A location based notification system.

This, as worded here, isn't unreasonable, but it depends on what notifications you're sending and why. The App Store guidelines rule out advertising through push notifications, so that probably isn't a good idea. Something like package delivery notifications would presumably be OK. Regardless, for push notifications, the user will have to accept that ""allow push notifications"" dialog.

As far as ""location based,"" apps can request location access while the app is open OR even when it's not open, and the user will have to approve the dialog asking (you've probably seen it before as an iOS user). Working within that limitation, you'll be able to have the user's location for targeting those notifications. I don't think you're likely to get a lot of users allowing access when the app is not open, but you may be able to target to their ZIP code if they've had you ship them something before.

> Payment integration with Visa and master cards.

Nothing too tricky here. If you're building this for an online shopping website, they probably already have a way of storing credit card information on behalf of users, so that'll be your easiest bet. Ideally you want your code (and thus your responsibility for securing it) to be handling it as little as possible, so if they'll give you an API for storing it and then referencing it by a UUID or last 4 digits, that'd be the best.

If you must store it on the device, you'd want to store it in the keychain, but this would inherently mean users of the online shopping site would have to re-enter it if ordering from their browser or something. I'd push for details if you're expected to keep credit card details any longer than is necessary to get them stored on their servers where you're no longer responsible for them.

If you're looking to impress, you could push to integrate Apple Pay. One of the key benefits is that you don't need to require users to create an account before purchasing, which is a huge reduction of friction in the purchasing process. You can literally have a user open your app for the first time, hit a purchase button, see the Apple Pay dialog (which includes their shipping address), approve it, and it's done. Metrics show that essentially any hurdle between the user and the purchase decision results in lower sales, and Apple Pay is unique in the way it lets you have users buy things without manually typing in addresses and credit card numbers (or having previously done so).

Stripe has an Apple Pay demo (usable from Safari) [here](https://stripe.com/apple-pay).

> Is there any course or book or any sample projects I should get my hands on before starting the project?

Unfortunately I have nothing for you here. I love the book I learned from, but it's from back when iOS was called ""iPhone OS"" and is focused on Objective-C and memory management.

Of all the work for the project, probably 98% will be in the UI and talking back and forth with the main site's API. That describes most every app, so your use case should fit well with whatever book / guide you find for building a modern Swift-based iOS app. Once you're good with the basics, using the location API and push notification APIs are not much more difficult.

> Any recommendation for app architecture, like MVP or MVVM? I am only starting with swift so haven't experienced much with RxSwfit and other architectures except MVC setup.

I haven't personally used any but MVC. I did do an app recently that was for both Mac and iOS, and I found that simply keeping the parts of the app that are not related to UI separate from the ones that are worked great for preventing ""massive view controller."" But I don't have experience with MVP or MVVM.

> And should I add firebase related tools to my skill set? This is just assuming but I would like to prepare some learning in advance to job.

I haven't used Firebase either, sorry. I've been a lot more focused on AWS, so I'd lean that direction for any significant server-side functionality. You can look toward CloudKit for your use cases that could be supported by its features (it is free, after all) but I'd probably only use it if you can get it to do all that you need. Otherwise you'd be maintaining two back end systems for one app.

Regardless, any one you choose will be good to add to your skillset. AWS is probably the most valuable, but likely also includes the greatest time investment on your part.",1535648431.0

PM_ME_YOUR_APP_IDEA,"My guess is that one of the constraints in the console is an `NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraint`, which means that when you loaded your nib, ios automatically created constraints that set its width and height.

To opt out of this behaviour, set `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` of your view you made from your nib to `false`, after you create it and before you add it to a view.

You can google what this does if you want, I’m on mobile and can’t really search for a good reference.",1535661605.0
alamare1,"Follow codevil’s advice here, but answer your question:

For interface builder and constraints to work, everything has to have a height and width constant. Rather it’s as large as the canvas, or as small as the home indicator. In a nib, this is defined as the height and width of your view at the time of initialization, which is usually acquired from what you give it in code to according to where the nib will go.

In addition to this, because this is where it sounds like you are actually having problems, constraints are the absolute part of this. Your nib doesn’t actually have a set height and width. When setting objects on a nib with constraints, you need to make sure 3 things:

1) If you are using static context that will never change, that the place you put your nib is EXACTLY the size of your nib to avoid breakage (e.g. if your nib is 375 x150, you better make sure every place you put it is too)

2) When doing constraints on non-controller based nibs, try to base everything off center and not the edges. Avoid connecting to edges Incase of sizing errors, as this will prevent constraint breakage as well.

3) It’s interface builder. EVERYONE messes up. I’ve been using it for 8 years. I STILL do it. Anyone who says they don’t is lying. Triple check your constrains with what is in the logs.

thisischemistry,"A `for` loop looks like this:

    for number in [1, 2, 5] {
      print(""number: \(number)"")
    }

This will print:

    number: 1
    number: 2
    number: 5

It's going through every element of a [`Sequence`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence), in this case an [`Array`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array). Each time through it stores the current element in `number` and makes it available to the code in the curly brackets {}.

If we replace `number` with an underscore then it will still repeat the same amount of times. However, it won't store the value to use in the curly brackets.

    for _ in [1, 2, 5] {
      print(""number:"")
    }

This will print:

    number:
    number:
    number:

Doing `1...power` creates a [`Range`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/range), which can be used as a `Sequence`. It will give you every number from `1` up to and including `power`. Since there are 10 numbers in that range it will loop 10 times.

    let base = 3 
    let power = 10 
    var answer = 1

    // count from 1 up to and including power
    // every time it loops do everything in the {}
    for _ in 1...power {
      // every time this is called multiply answer * base and save it in answer
      // this is shorthand for answer = answer * base 
      answer *= base 
    } 
    print(""\(base) to the power of \(power) is \(answer)"") 
    // Prints ""3 to the power of 10 is 59049""

So it loops a number of times equal to `power`, which is 10. Every time it multiplies by 3 and saves it in `answer`. At the end it prints out all the variables. The result is 3^10 because it multiplied 3 for 10 times or 3\*3\*3\*3\*3\*3\*3\*3\*3\*3.",1535567617.0

thisischemistry,"###Inconsistant formatting and not following conventions.

If your code looks messy it's difficult to review. Also, it indicates a general disdain for doing things the right way and being friendly to your fellow developers. Finally, if it's hard to read then 6 months from now even you will have a headache trying to understand your own code.

###Very little documentation.

I'm a very big fan of self-documenting code but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be any documentation. Interfaces should have documentation even when they are obvious, especially public interfaces. Tricky bits of code or non-obvious assumptions should be pointed out. Functions, types, methods, properties, and so on should be named clearly so they self-document.

###Forced anything. 

Forced unwrapping, implicitly-unwrapped `Optional`, `try!` - they are all very bad signs. Occasionally they are good to have but it's a red flag to scrutinize.

###Deeply-nested statements, especially stuff like `if…else…if`. 

They are difficult to read and follow. Those should be converted to a `switch` statement or at least try to use the comma syntax for `if` statements where you can.

###Not using `guard` for early exits from scope.

This goes along with the previous idea that deeply-nested statements are a bad pattern to follow. However, `guard` also highlights the flow of the scope - that you're exiting early because something has gone off the rails.

###Any time I see a ""NS"" prefix on a type. 

Yes, there are still reasons to use types leftover from Objective-C but many have been bridged over to Swift and those should be used preferentially.

###Types that stuff too much in their initial definitions. 

Those should be fairly bare-bones and much of the functionality moved into extensions or other types. Overly-complicated initial definitions are a bad code smell. The same goes for files that have more than a few types or which go on for thousands of lines for a single type. Break stuff up into logical, modular units and name the files appropriately. This also leverages the proper use of access control keywords.

###Projects that don't break their code into reusable modules.

Unless you're dealing with a very small example project you probably should break your code into several modules with well-defined interfaces between them. This allows you to work on discrete parts of your code, test them separately, reduce the spread of dependencies, and decrease bugs due to fragile architecture. You can also use a module in several projects and then update all those projects at once by updating a single module, making sure all your code is as up-to-date and tested as possible.

###Misuse or non-use of common design patterns.

I'm not a stickler for buzzwords or rigid architecture but it's a good idea to have knowledge of some of the more common design patterns and naming conventions. By using a pattern you can easily validate that you're operating on generally-accepted principles and you can leverage the larger world of tutorials, documentation, and guides out there.

Android is easier to work with, you don't have to spend time on configuring npm modules, Typescript, looking for basic plugins like navigation and so on. It's also easier and more straightforward to just build and run your app. You are not dependant on react devs, to support new os features and fixing bugs. Although you could write native Android code and bridge it to react, but you have to learn third platform. Performance is slightly better, app size is smaller, debugging is easier, community is bigger and you have more control of your app.

* The Big Nerd Ranch books. Both the one about the Swift language and the one about iOS programming. Note: new editions are apparently being worked on, so maybe wait a little bit.
* Ray Wenderlich's site. 
* hackingwithswift.com

My problem with learning Swift so far has been there are two large topics and everyone treats them as two books. One is ""learning Swift"", which means picking up a lot of language idioms to help you understand how to deal with complexity. The other is ""learning iOS/MacOS development"", which means becoming familiar with XCode, Interface Builder, and a handful of APIs and idioms you'll use for designing apps.

So you end up with a conundrum. Swift language oriented books tend to be more dry and boring. They try not to focus on many APIs, which means you can't do anything really fun. But app development oriented books can leave you hanging at the end: they always lack a final chapter where you are taught how to use the language to manage a fairly complex application. You'll find them saying, ""Don't mind this syntax, I'll explain it later if at all"", because they're trying to teach you some API rather than some language concept. It's a mess.

So that's how I feel the BNR books split: you need both, it's most ideal to read Swift then iOS, but the Swift one is a tougher read.

I haven't subscribed to Ray Wenderlich yet, but what I can see of his free content is the closest to the ideal I've found. Articles like [this one](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5542-enum-driven-tableview-development) show how to use the Enum features in Swift to simplify state management in a TableView-driven application. Most books I've read don't take you this deep: they teach you about the features of TableView but *not* how a competent developer deals with their complexity. I'm really interested in subscribing to this.

But I spent my quarter's budget on hackingwithswift.com. The e-Books I got are competent and fine, and I like that they're updated as iOS updates. But you really only get the ""iOS"" flavor of books out of it as far as I can tell. 

But maybe take my words with a grain of salt. I hacked at iOS for a couple of weeks then got sucked into writing HTML/JS projects instead.",1535394786.0

EvilGremlin,"You can have tuples as dictionary entries, like this:

    var aerodromes: [String: (Int, Int)] = [""Douglas"":(10, 28), ""Belfast"":(50, 106)]

    typealias Locus = (Int, Int)

joanniso,"First advice I'll give you, look at other opensource projects that you aspire to be. Not necessarily the same type of project (HTTP client, GUI framework, ...) but the way they're handling one or more aspects.

If you're asking the technical side of things, just start. I built my frameworks and libraries by working on them whilst working on the projects that use them. So I'd build a project similar to a blog and I'd implement all CRUD functionality for MongoKitten at the moment I needed them. And went on from there.

Build something you'd love to use yourself, and go for it. Get yourself worked up and excited and make the best damn thing you can imagine. But don't think some was built in a day. Be persistent and put in the hours regularly. Don't make it a one-week effort.

Always remember that your 1.0 tag isn't \_really\_ 1.0. Many projects never seem to release a 1.0, seeing it as a point where everything is perfect. This is not how it needs to be. Other projects release a new major version every other minute. I prefer releasing a major version when I think the codebase needs to be (largely) rewritten.

Don't shy away from rewriting code. It's rarely ever perfect the first try. Learn by browsing other codebase and find goodies you could be using in your next version.

Write the language you prefer and get excited about. If that's ObjC, go for it. If it's Swift, which I think makes sense in this subreddit, go swift!

Don't drag unnecessary dependencies, but don't get stuck by the lack of them either. You can have 200 dependencies at the start, but once you have some good progress, see if you \_really\_ need all of them and how (easily) you can do without them. Do you use all of the project? Or only a small piece of it? Can you reproduce this piece yourself and learning from it in the process?

Performance can go suck it at the start, as I said, nothing's perfect. And caring about performance is something you'll need to learn over time. Doing performance right is quite tough and it's a process you'll find yourself in at some point. But not necessarily now.",1535349521.0

lucasvandongen,"A good framework:

* Is maintained
* Has a API that is a leak-free abstraction of what happens inside.
* Has a consistent API
* Has descriptive names for functions, classes and other data
* Has good examples in the README that should get you started for both basic and advanced usages
* Is written in Objective-C
* But has a wrapper that makes it Swift-y to use (if needed)
* Works both in Carthage and Cocoapods. *(Personally I don't understand Carthage people but their life is already hard enough without readily available frameworks)*
* Does not drag in a ton of dependencies. Like Alamofire where you could  use native API's
* Behaves well in unexpected situations. Don't expect x always having value y or z never being nil as people break your stuff in unexpected ways.
* The law of three. A framework is only battle-tested when you have three projects using it. Do not 1.0 it before your third project shipped using it.
* Is used by at least three different developers than you not being direct colleagues. Really people using the framework only by reading the README and having success with it.
* If possible watch somebody trying to use it

thisischemistry,"One of the better ways to handle achievements is to have a bit-set type of structure. For example, you could represent the list of achievements for a character with an array of bits:

achievements | first | second | third | fourth | total
-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:
achieved | true | false | true | true |
value | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 
total | +1 | 0 | +4 | +8 | 13
So the character has done the achievements first, third, and fourth but not the second. Now you use those bits and combine them into a value:

    1 + 4 + 8 = 13

Store that value into a property.

Is it a lot of math? It would be but Swift has [`OptionSet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optionset) that handles it all for you.

    struct AchievementType: OptionSet, Hashable {
      let rawValue: Int
      static let first  = AchievementType(rawValue: 1 << 0)
      static let second = AchievementType(rawValue: 1 << 1)
      static let third  = AchievementType(rawValue: 1 << 2)
      static let fourth = AchievementType(rawValue: 1 << 3)
    }

    var current: AchievementType = [.first, .third, .fourth]
    print(current.contains(.first)) // true

The advantages are a single value takes up very little room in a data struct, `OptionSet` is easy to construct and query, and you can easily create combined groups of achievement sets and test them all at once.

    let testGroup: AchievementType = [.first, .fourth]
    print(current.isSuperset(of: testGroup)) // true

    let testGroup2: AchievementType = [.second, .fourth]
    print(current.isSuperset(of: testGroup2)) // false

    current.update(with: .second)
    print(current.isSuperset(of: testGroup2)) // true

Then you can a `Dictionary` or similar to map the data to the achievement type in order to retrieve it:

    struct AchievementData {
      let title: String
      let description: String
      // condition, etc.
    }

    let achievements: [AchievementType: AchievementData] = [
      .first : AchievementData(title: ""First"", description: ""The first.""),
      .second: AchievementData(title: ""Second"", description: ""The second."")]

I can't get my XPC service to work (process doesn't start, completion handler on XPC method call not executed) from the context of a `qlgenerator` (quicklook plugin). I know in principle it should be possible, because I see that there's an iMessage related `qlgenerator` in `/System/Library/Quicklook` written by apple, which has an xps service embedded with it.

Unlike adding a new XPC target to a cocoa app, adding one to a quicklook plugin doesn't offer to embed it, so I had to recreate that process manually, by copying the build XPC service into `MyQLPlugin.qlgenerator/Contents/XPCServices`. I suspect there are more steps to it than just that, which is causing my silent failure.

The truth is: you’re good at Swift if you can use it to solve a problem that you have. 

How do you know if you’re good at using a screwdriver? Well, can you use it to drive a screw? If so, you’re at a perfectly acceptable level of competence in using a screwdriver. Somebody else may be able to drive a screw faster or in a tougher material than you, but that doesn’t change that fact that you know how to use a screwdriver. You can get better at using a screwdriver by watching those other people or maybe getting stronger. 

Swift is a tool. It’s nothing more. If you can use the tool to solve your problem (writing an app in this case), you’re doing just fine. Maybe you don’t have the cleanest or most efficient code, but that doesn’t change the fact that you’ve used the tool effectively for its purpose. The best way to improve is just to keep using the tool. Maybe look at some projects on GitHub and read some articles on Medium for some insights, ideas, tips, and tricks. You can read Apple’s Documentation and watch WWDC videos to learn from their code samples.

You ask someone that has run a software company and they say ""it's when you write code that is robust, easy to understand and can be read by others with standard training.""

&#x200B;

Coming from a person that has run a software company for years, I see ANY language as a tool that makes a product that the customer uses.  Swift is one part of a set of tools an I'm actually concerned about how different Swift can look.

&#x200B;

Imagine a company having a product written in Swift where they've extended and overwritten and 3rd partied the code such that it really doesn't look like basic Swift.  Then the programmers leave and the company is trying to find some new programmers that want to learn the code base and they need them to become productive quickly.

&#x200B;

There's a balance, complex code vs code that an average programmer can read and understand quickly.  Some same the complex code make it easier to modify, other say it makes it harder to understand and simple code is better.

Example: look at Swift 1 vs Swift 2 vs 3 and 4...  Look at the handling of strings, for next loops, ++/-- and all the other changes.  Imagine having a bunch of production code all over the place and having to pay people to come in and bring everything up to some standard.

Next, look at using Bonjour to discover the Mac App from the iOS app (path of least resistance).

Sajjon,"Although I cannot provide any reference, I have heard that the time complexity of a computed property ought to be O(1), i.e. constant time. So if you need to iterate through a theoretically long sequence (array, dictionary etc) i.e. linear time complexity - O(n) - you ought to make it a function. I think that makes sense.

Also, if you need to make use of generics you MUST use a function.",1535030042.0
noahd,"Quoting another developer:

computed properties are assumed to be pure and run in constant time

JimDabell,"Computed properties are methods behind the scenes, so technically you could use methods for everything.  The main difference between them is not so much technical as semantic.  Pick the one that best represents the meaning of what it is you are doing.

- Is it a noun?  Then use a computed property.
- Is it a verb?  Then use a method.

So you would pick `Profile.friends` over `Profile.getFriends()` but you wouldn't pick `Profile.block` over `Profile.block()` because that's an action that you are performing, not a thing you are accessing.
",1535043187.0
xtravar,"I like the complexity answers, but there are cases I can think of where I disagree with that. Ex: if you’re converting a type to another type and they contain collections.

IMO, the way to determine this is the usage. Ask yourself: If the public API of the type remains constant, but the implementation changes, could the implementation *ever* have that member as a stored value?  If so, it’s a property and not a function. Look at URL- it has absoluteString as a property. It *could* be stored, it *could* be computed (I suspect it is); as a user of the API it makes no difference because it is something *intrinsically tied to the instance’s value* rather than something *incidentally made as a result of an instance’s value*.  There’s probably something to be said there about the result’s lifetime and usage.

This kind of analysis requires well-thought interfaces and separation of responsibilities. If you aren’t used to doing that, it could be a little difficult to get the hang of. The complexity argument is kind of a heuristic shortcut.

I think a harder question in Swift is “when do you use a converting init ( B.init(A) ) vs a converting property or func (A.asB)?”  That seems like more of a stylistic call.",1535032384.0
Wieczorny,"The rule of thumb I follow:

Basically, I assume I don't need to use computed properties at all and I use only functions. This rule, however, has one exception. Whenever I want to add function which starts with `get...` and it has no parameters, I use computed properties instead. For example, let's say I need to implement some custom `LinkedList` collection and I want to be able to check its size. So instead of adding `getSize()` method, I will add `size` property.

Following this rule seems to be pretty easy, but unfortunately it doesn't. The hard part is to understand, when I should write `get...` function. For example, let's say I have some collection of Users and I want to compute average age of the user. I can add function `getAverageAge`, but such function is not about ""getting"" its value from somewhere, it's about ""computing"" it. So it should be named `computeAverageAge`. Actually, I would extract it to separate class, because computing some statistics is not a responsibility of collection. So it's all about following SRP (and other SOLID) principles, good naming etc. If you do this, you will be able to use that rule.",1535035033.0
alpha_m,"I like the above answers about complexity but I’d add a couple more qualifiers:

It’s technically possible to mutate self’s properties in a computed property definition, but if the code can mutate the type’s other properties, I would reserve it for a function. I would hope that’s obvious most of the time, unless maybe you’re measuring the number of times a property was accessed for some reason. 

I classify my functions 3 ways most of the time:
-functional, f(x)as in functional programming declarative style
-mutating, as in they can alter the state of the type they’re called on 
-required, only there to fulfill a protocol requirement or some other utility

I think Any value that you compute “functionally”  could be a candidate for a computed property as long as computation time is considered like other comments suggested. ",1535034893.0
lightningfuzz,"I like to use functions when it is more of an “action” that the object is taking (e.g. draw, move, play, etc), and use computed properties when it’s more of a “property” of, or item/value related to, the object (ex: description, average, fullName, etc). I’m sure there are gray areas to this. I like what others said about time complexity. ",1535040472.0

Functions vs Properties

In some cases functions with no arguments might be interchangeable with read-only properties. Although the semantics are similar, there are some stylistic conventions on when to prefer one to another.

Prefer a property over a function when the underlying algorithm:

* does not throw
* has a O(1) complexity
* is cheap to calculate (or caсhed on the first run)

I can recall reading on the internet for how to spot and stop PHP security problems and I remember that as a newbie, I felt there were problems *everywhere*.

The Swift language is pretty simple, and, other than a few sharp edges like *optionals*, can be learned a little bit at a time. The part that made me *feel* like I was always a beginner was the huge number of Apple libraries and the feeling that things had so much going on that I didn't understand them.

But it's certainly learnable. Apple's documentation is pretty good, but the issue is that it seems like you feel like a beginner for so long. And then one day when you've programmed your 30th *toy* app you realize, ""Hey, this isn't so hard""

I think you can't accomplish that using high level animation APIs such as UIView.animate. You need to use CADisplayLink and create an animation from scratch, using this timer that allows you run code each refresh of the screen (frame).",1534890360.0

I've done something very similar in the past. Basically, you extend `CALayer`, and setup a property on your new layer that can be animated. As that layer is animating the property, every frame it's `display()` method is triggering a block of code you set before beginning the animation.

As for getting information about the layer's position or other properties, you'll need to check its [`presentation()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/1410744-presentation) method to get info about the currently displayed state. If you ask for position, alpha, etc. on the layer itself, you'll get the values that are being animated to, and not the in-flight values.",1534892717.0
xtravar,"I wouldn’t advise this, but layer.presentationLayer gets you the exact position.

But that’s getting messy...

Depending how much content, you could magnify all of the content in advance and mask it. Sometimes you have to think outside the box with these things.

In other words, make your circle view with a border and set clipsToBounds. Add a snapshotView of your content inside of it, and make sure it’s translation is zoomed. When animating, make sure to move the inside view to compensate. It’s not hard, it’s just math, and it should all animate fine with the high level APIs. Unless you have a ton of robust content that will cause this to be slow, I think it’ll work. (And make sure the content view doesn’t contain the magnifying glass, otherwise that could have weird effects.)

I kinda wanna try this for fun now.

* WholeView contains ContentView and MagnifyingView
* MagnifyingView contains ContentSnapshotView created with contentView.snapshotView.
* ContentSnapshotView scale 2x
* MagnifyingView constrained width==height, layer cornerRadius = 1/2 height, clipsToBounds=yes, borderWidth = 3, borderColor=black

    self.identifier = identifier

",1534881627.0
ShottyMcKeith,"[From the swift docs](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Initialization.html):

> You implement this initialization process by defining initializers, which are like special methods that can be called to create a new instance of a particular type. Unlike Objective-C initializers, Swift initializers do not return a value. Their primary role is to ensure that new instances of a type are correctly initialized before they are used for the first time.

Not every property of a type must have a value when declared, but every property (that isn't optional) must have a value **after initialization**. That is the entire point of initialization. There are some properties that you don't want to have default values.

With your example, try creating an instance of Card.

    let foo = Card()

What happens? You get a compiler error. The compiler will not allow you to make a Card without calling the designated initializer. But this works:

    let foo = Card(identifier: 100)

The point of the parameter is that the calling code is required to provide the identifier to the Card before it can be created. As /u/nielsbot explained, the init method accepts a parameter named ""identifier"" and assigns it to the property that is also named ""identifier"". If the name collision is confusing, you could also write the init method like this:

    init(newIdentifier: Int) {
    	identifier = newIdentifier
    }

It accomplishes the same thing. It's pretty common, however, to have parameters with the same names as properties which is why you need the ""self"" prefix to make it clear which one you're talking about.",1534890444.0

Yes, there are many functional programming ideas in Rx but that doesn’t make it FRP. FRP requires behaviors (continuous functions) and usually includes linear intercepts and denotative syntax. Instead, Rx uses Subjects, side effects and mutable closure capture and offers only events (not behaviors and no, BehaviorSubject is not really a behavior in the FRP sense).

See Conal Elliot’s statement on the matter, here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5875929/specification-for-a-functional-reactive-programming-language

danielt1263,"The point of FRP (ReactiveX) is to make our code declarative. The code becomes a definition of a set of invariants that must hold true instead of just steps in a process.

Think of each Observable in your code as if it was a cell in a spreadsheet. When other cells (Observables) change, it applies its formula (algorithm) to determine it's own value which may make other cells (Observables) change. The entire app becomes a cascade of changing data with fixed semantics and guarantees.

With imperative code, when you say `a = b + c` you're just describing a step in a process. When you do the same in Rx `a = Observable.combineLatest(b, c, resultSelector: +)` you are defining an invariant relationship between the three variables that will always hold true.

Lastly, Rx isn't easy, but once you grok it you will find that it's simple. All the various ways you currently handle callbacks (NotificationCenter, closures, IBActions, delegates, and KVO) get rolled up into a single system.

Slypenslyde,"I think the problem happens when too many keywords get glommed together.

Functional programming is a style, and some languages are better at it than others. While it takes a lot to explain what it is, once you understand it you can start understanding what problems it solves best and use it there. 

You can paste ""reactive programming"" into that, but as far as I know there aren't any exclusively ""reactive languages"" like there are for functional programming. But it is true that ""languages good at functional programming"" are also ""languages good at reactive solutions"". 

Trying to explain both at one time is hard. Trying to explain why a new paradigm is better to someone comfy with the old paradigm is hard. I think what took me the longest to figure out about Reactive programming is ""I don't have to use it everywhere"". It's a good fit for specific problems, and a *really bad fit* for most others.

Hence people who dismiss it as ""buzzword bullshit"". They try it once, possibly on a problem it isn't good at solving, and it doesn't work out well for them. So they never try it again. They've done it with unit testing. Agile practices. You name it, there's someone out there who tried it once and thinks anyone who uses it successfully is brainwashed.

Swift container types like String, Array, and Dictionary are value types with copy-on-write, but all of the iOS APIs are expecting Objective-C container types like NSString, NSArray, and NSDictionary which are reference types. This can be OK, since none of those types are mutable. But if you are making changes in a for loop, then passing the result to an iOS API you have to worry about multiple expensive conversions each time through the loop.

I leave as an exercise for you rewriting in functional programming style their example of coloring all occurrences of 'brown' brown in a book represented as a String.

As recently as this weekend I [helped](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/98ekto/error_unrecognized_selector_sent_to_instance/) an unfortunate Swift programmer who was bitten at the boundary between Swift and iOS APIs in Objective-C.

The contents of a string are different between Objective-C and Swift: a string of 3 characters in one language may have a different number of characters in the other since one uses UTF-16 characters and the other uses graphemes.

Addition and multiplication of integers are different between Objective-C and Swift, but since Swift must provide compatibility bridging, you can use Swift's &+ and &\* to get the Objective-C addition and multiplication.

Those issues matter because people write Swift to talk to Objective-C APIs.

I'll save compatibility with C++ - easy in Objective-C, difficult in Swift for another time. Also concurrency, and ABI issues will wait.

In short, to be effective in iOS, you must know Objective-C. If your program is in Objective-C you can stop reading and start coding. If you are programming Swift, then you must also know the must larger Swift languages, and the rough edges at the interfaces. And in answer to the Swift partisans, if you don't know Obj-C, then you are dealing with ""unknown unknowns' - you may not be aware that you are missing something.

,"You just replace the syntax used in the deprecated form and usually Xcode will auto fix it if the name of the new form is similar to the old form.  If its one of those functions that  are completely gone and not remade in a different form, then you just find the new way to do it by looking at the new API.  The deprecated code will still work if your project is designed for an iOS version that the deprecated code was valid for.  They usually leave a grace period of one whole version for developers to make changes to accommodate  any deprecations.

Its sorta impossible to deal with deprecated code if you don't know how the original methods worked in the first place.  

That line of code just looks like its checking the metadata for a downloadURL value and converting it into a String so it can assign it to imageURL.  You would go around that by first finding out what kind of values are in the metadata, then finding the new way to grab the ""downloadURL"" value, and then turning it into a String.  Just do something like ""print(metadata)"" and see if you can see any values in it in the console log.  If its like a mess of data with random numbers and letters, then you can figure out that ""downloadURL()"" calls a function on the metadata and the return value of downloadURL contains what you want, and the absoluteString probably just converts it to a string type.  So if any one of those are broken from deprecation, you just look up the API docs, and find which functions will give you the result that the deprecated feature used to give you.

Instead of using self.addChild for all your nodes, make a parent SKSpriteNode for all other nodes, and then add this new “global world” node as a child of the scene (self). 

In addition, when you are sizing things, dont do self.size.width/4 or something like that. Use globalWorld.size instead OR you can just use constants for everything which i will explain in a second. 

Since this is all part of one global node, you can resize this global node and everything will scale with it. So what i do is i develop everything based on and iphonr 6s screen (all the condtants n stuff) and then i scale the global node up to be as big as it can be, while maintaining its aspect ratio and centering it on the screen. Then i design my game to have some unnecessary space on the edges (a buffer zone) that can be clipped or added without a large change to the game. This is how a lot of tv shows are filmed ( i believe). If you need me to explain this part better let me know because its the core prt of this method

No. Let's say you want to animate inserting a row, so you call `insertRows(...)`. But let's say you want to insert a row AND delete a row AND move another row down 2 places. But if you call insertRow then deleteRow then moveRow, each will animate one by one. Instead, you want to animate them all together. That's when you call `beginUpdates()`. You call it, then you perform all the changes, then you call `endUpdates()` and the tableView animates all of your changes simultaneously.

I think `performBatchUpdates()` is the more modern and preferred way to do this.

If your underlying data changed and you want to reload a section, (ie: call your data source and get new data for the section), then you just call `reloadSection()`. You wouldn't call `beginUpdates()`.",1534534678.0

jasamer,"This is a great example for a good use of operator overloading :-)

For some feedback, your terminology does not really align with standard ""math"" terminology.

For example, why does a `Term` have `Exponentiation`s and a `coefficient`? Something like ""a+b"" is a term. Your ""term"" struct is something else.

The way you compose your expressions also doesn't really add up, but if your API works out as expected, I guess it doesn't matter that much.

In your example, there are also some terminology issues... `let equation = (3x + 5y - 17) * (7x - 9y + 23)`: That is not an equation, it's a term. An equation contains an equals sign. `let equation = (x = 5 * b)` would be an example for that, but unfortunately, you can't override `=` like this in swift (and I don't think that you want to support that, anyway).

In `equation.solve() {[ x <- 4, y <- 1 ]}`, ""solve"" isn't the correct word either, I think ""evaluate"" would be better. I like the way you did the assignments though! As an example for what I'd expect `solve` to do: `let equation = (a+b=0); let solved = equation.solve(for: a)`. The result would be equation `a = -b` (or maybe just the term `-b`). In other words, I'd expect to solve an equation for a variable, and as a result, I do not necessarily expect a numeric value - a term that does not contain the variable I solved for is also ok.",1534524400.0

phughes,"The predicate syntax in this case is simple: `""age == 45""`. If you want to use a variable for the age you use NSPredicate's predicateWithFormat method and the string `""age == %@"", age`.

Predicates don't have a SELECT statement, like SQL does, so you don't indicate that you only want the name in the predicate.

A fetch request usually returns NSManagedObjects or their appropriate custom subclass if you've set them up, in this case Person objects. If you're really only going to use the name property you can set your NSFetchRequest's propertiesToFetch attribute and that'll save a tiny amount of time when fetching.

For people using CoreData I always recommend they install mogenerator and run it every time they update their data model. It implements the 'generation gap' design pattern by machine generating a subclass of NSManagedObject for each of your entities with accessors for each property so that you can do things like `person.name`.

fossfool,"Hey what a fun project! 

I downloaded the code off gitHub, and played with it a bit. First, I scrolled in one direction for about 15 minutes and watched the memory. It was slowly creeping up. It got up to 56Mb - most likely normal usage but you might want to dig into it and see if there's an issue. I really like how smooth the scrolling action is: vertical, horizontal, and diagonal scrolling. It's very smooth.

While I don't think there's anything wrong with your approach, I had another thought. Let's say you're just scrolling up: Your process is to create a new tile outside the visible area on top and destroy a tile out of view on the bottom.  What if rather than constantly creating and destroying tiles, you did something like this?  [TileRotissery.png](https://github.com/fossfool/thoughts/blob/master/TileRotisary.png). 

If you imagined having several of these ""tile rotisseries"" making a toroidal ""donut like""  shape [like so....](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-torus_model_of_the_universe#/media/File:Bryan_Brandenburg_Big_Bang_Big_Bagel_Theory_Howard_Boom.jpg) You would update the label for vertical movement on the inside of the donut for the entire inner ring as it rotates around the poloidal axis, and for horizontal you would update an entire poloidal ""ring"" segment. [This pic](https://github.com/fossfool/thoughts/blob/master/ToroidalCoord2.png) might explain what I'm thinking a little better.  You'd end up with a finite set of tiles, and reduce the work a bit.

One path is to simply find a tutorial that matches what you're doing.  That might be a long shot, so you might have to take the app and break it down and do several tutorials to cover most of it.

The other option is to buy the source code from one of those ""apps for sale"" sites.  You pay a bit of money (usually < $150) and you get the app with source code.

Another option is to get as close as you can with books and tutorials, then ask for help or pay someone on Fiverr / Upwork for a fixed bid to finish off what you're having trouble with.

The skill of being an app dev is great to have but takes quite a bit of time.

You can go here and see if you can find a tutorial that matches your needs.

I would start with taking the app in question and outlining every thing it does, button by button, screen by screen.  Get screen shots and make slides and notes on every step.  Show the flow of info and events.

You'll find that many apps have a lot of things in common.  Things like data storage, communication with other apps, displaying data, etc...

I'll give you an example of what I did.  I saw an app that uses AI in poker and wanted to have a modified version of it.  So I found some poker engines and I'm playing with them to understand them.  One of them collects stats about the odds of types of hands you'll get pre-flop by running a number of simulations.  This is cool, so I learn how they do these things.

Here are a few reasons why you might like my book:

* It assumes you have some programming experience, so if you're coming to this from another language, don't worry, we won't be wasting time on what a variable is... Instead it discusses what's new, exciting and different about Swift compared to other languages.
* It goes pretty lightning fast through what you need to know about Swift over just two chapters and then gets stuck into iOS development. You'll find other Swift sidebars sprinkled through the book as they are relevant.
* It looks at the process of building an app using a case study, following its journey from the germ of an idea right through to publishing it on the app store.

    }

    extension Saveable where Self: FieldProtocol {

    	}
    }

We define a class,`MyObject` that conforms to `FieldProtocol` and so defines a `field` property.  Note that `MyObect` also conforms to `Saveable`. 

Now, we place an extension on `Saveable` and add the constraint `where Self: FieldProtocol`. No we can access the `field` property  of `FieldProtocol` inside the extension! This is super cool because now `MyObject` can get saving behavior for free as long as it simply conforms to the necessary protocols. Imagining  `field` were a more complex object and `save()` were a more complex function, you can see how conditional conformance and extensions can save a lot of code.

 `MyObject` can of course define its own implementation of `save()` outside of the default implementation as defined in the extension on `Saveable`. 

Does any of this help at all? :-)

EDIT2: Missing a `var`",1533847725.0
underscore_at,"Regardless of implementation, I would use an optional bool, with `nil` meaning it wasn’t set yet. That would reduce any extra vars tracking set or not.

Though, if you can set it *during* initialization, use a `let`.",1533913268.0
remember_is_ninja,"If you are only possibly mutating it in the initialiser of the enclosing class, you could use an optional let. Then to access it use the nil-coalescing operator:

    if isOn ?? false {
        // true
    } else {
        // false or not set
    }

Otherwise I’d be doing the class/struct based approach, possibly using a function to set whether it’s on or not. That way the function can throw an error if the value is already set—results of actions should be either predictable or handleable, if you don’t know wether attempting to flip the switch will succeed, you probably want to handle the case where it fails.",1533847202.0
lucasvandongen,"You want people to set it just to on? Or to off should stay stuck as well?

In the case it should only turn on, perhaps you can better just hide it with a method that has a much more clear intent:

Celvin_,"I had a brief moment to play around with the app earlier today. As someone who’s in the early phase of learning Swift, this is definitely something I’ll use more once it gets released. 

Although, I can’t really help you out with anything related to the practical aspects of the app, I do have a lot of experience in using simmilar apps. 

I’ll give you a few pointers that I personally find works for me. I first picked up Swift a couple of months ago. As someone who has a full time job, a wife and two kids, I don’t always have that much time on my hands to dive into the heavier curriculum. Add to the fact that I have no prior coding experience, a lot of the time things have to be simple enough that I can easily pick things up where I last left it. I find that apps are a perfect companion on the commute. 

I try to diversify the different sources I learn from as much as possible. I’m reading a LOT.  I have several books(including two of yours). I ‘m trying to read the official handbook from Apple, and I’m almost finished with the xcode exercises from Intro to App Developlent with Swift. I also have videos, including the one from Stanford, the Udemycourse from Angela Yu and lots of bookmarks to youtubers out there. 

After plowing through a lot of material and getting the gist of the most basic stuff, I’m at a point where I want to practice what I’ve learned as I go further.  My favorites are the coding challenges from the Hackerrank site, the Mimo app and from the playground excercises from Intro to App Developlent with Swift. The first and latter, doesn’t really hold your hand that much, which makes solving the challenges even more rewarding. The daily challenges from the Mimo app, offers some bytesize challenges that have the perfect format for coding on the go. It only suffers from being way too simple at times. The difficulty level is really inconsistent, as other days the daily challenge is a lot tougher. 

I guess being able to actually code within the app would be awesome. There are several apps out there that support this today already.  This is not a request, but having some kind of social element within the app, would make it a lot more interactive. 

Well, I went on a rant, but here are the most importmat takeaways:
- Apps like these, should focus on quick lessons, challenges etc. From the looks of it, you’re on the right track. 
- I haven’t had the time to test this enough, but having optional tasks at the end of a subject is good when the tasks themselves are varied and challenging enough.
- Being able to code within the app would be awesome. Having challenges where you gave examples of how one could solve a specific challenge, would be even more awesome. 
- When incorporated correctly, having some kind of social element is actually pretty cool. (Check out SoloLearn for instance)

It looks like you have made a a great job so far! Releasing this app without IAP’s is truly awesome!",1533853565.0

(I've built a pyramid, a tower & other stuff with coordinate arrays so far.. Sounds super silly but it feels great to be able to say that, being totally new to the world of programming.) The key is to keep coming back at it from different angles and practice what you've learned. 

As for now, I have finished Learn to Code 3 and am now attempting some of the other additional challenges within Playgrounds & also brushing up on what I've learned so far (by revisiting & redoing some of the challenges from Learn to Code 1, 2 & 3). 

Next stop on my Swift journey would be Apple's 'Intro to App Development With Swift'. It's a short iBooks guide for beginners, like you and I, where you apparently learn how to create an app in XCode by following the instructions therein.. I should god-willing be getting started with that in about a week. But before I do that, as I said, I feel I should be brushing up on some essential concepts. So I am going to do that for another week.

Your demo app in the App Store along with all the white label versions can execute the same code against DIFFERENT data.

Imagine each white label app runs against a config.json

 * etc.

Each white label version of the app is:

 the first ? is an optional because the currentCam may be nil. the second ? is not an optional,  it's part of the ternary operator, (a ? b : c). basically a condensed if else statement

IDK your background, so I'll start at ground zero.

\>(currentCam?.position == .front) means:

*if the optional var currentCam.position  is equal to .front*

the var currentCam is an optional and has a property call position.

If it's equal, newCam is assigned rearCam, if it's not equal, newCam is assigned frontCam

I'm kinda wondering why the rearCam and frontCam aren't .rearCam and .frontCam ... maybe assumed, but maybe it doesn't have the benefit of being checked by Xcode like a enum would, IDK.

If that's your code, I think if the currentCam is nil, you crash, a guard or if let might be a better choice.",1533618085.0

KarlJay001,"I wasn't sure how to cancel a dispatched thread, so I looked it up and found this:

[http://jordansmith.io/cancelling-background-tasks/](http://jordansmith.io/cancelling-background-tasks/)

>On a final note - once a dispatch task has started running, neither cancelling or suspending the task/queue/work item will stop it. Cancelling and suspending operations only effect tasks that haven’t yet been called. If you must do this, you will need to manually check the cancelled state at appropriate moments during the task’s execution, and exit the task if needed.

Seems you can't cancel, but if I'm wrong, plz let me know.

One thought that comes to mind is to use the observer or callback type approach where you get a notice when something is completed.

The callback (completion block) would probably be the easier of the two.  Basically you have a block of code that executes when the job is complete.  You can have all of them call a common function that kills off the others inside the completion block.

I haven't read this one, but there's several examples out there:

The body shape will wrap around the exterior only. When you pass in tubeShape for your body shape, SceneKit will return an optimized version for better performance. 

And so when you create your bouncing objects, it is being placed inside the tube's physics body. Since you have collisionBitMask turned on, they will repel from each other (you may have noticed a slight acceleration perhaps?) You can verify this by turning on the debug option for physics shape. 

//sceneView.debugOptions = .showPhysicsShapes

To get the body shape you want, you will have to use  SCNPhysicsShape.concavePolyhedron

The approach I'd probably take is to build a ML model, from a few days of recordings of standing / sitting / walking / etc. Record all the accelerometer data, find some way to define motion event boundaries, then classify each motion event as the kind of physical activity that you performed at that time. Then you'd have an ML classifier that you can feed raw accelerometer data into and get out an answer about what kind of physical event it was most likely to have been. 

That's pretty much what Core Motion's activity types engine is doing. It's feeding the raw accelerometer data into an ML classifier that's trained on walking, running, cycling, etc.

nielsbot,"Let's say you have different event types:

    class Event {...}

    class MouseEvent : Event {...}
    class KeyEvent : Event {...}

You might have an event handler callback, like this:

    func handleEvent(e:Event) {
    }


In this case you would use down casting (converting from a less specific type to a more specific type--you can remember the ""subclasses"" are usually shown below (down from) their superclasses in class diagrams)

	func handleEvent(e:Event) {
	    if e is MouseEvent {
	        handleMouseEvent(e as! MouseEvent) // forced downcast to `MouseEvent`, we used the `is` operator to know that `e` is a `MouseEvent`
	    }
	    if e is KeyEvent {
	        handleKeyEvent(e as! KeyEvent). // forced downcast to `KeyEvent`, see above
	    }
	}

Swift lets you write this code in a few less tedious ways. 

1. Using conditional down-cast:

	    func handleEvent(e:Event) {
	 
	        if let mouseEvent = e as? MouseEvent { // if e is, in fact, a MouseEvent, assign it as type `MouseEvent` to `mouseEvent`
	            handleMouseEvent(mouseEvent)
	        }
	        if let keyEvent = e as? KeyEvent { // if e is, in fact, a MouseEvent, assign it as type `MouseEvent` to `mouseEvent`
	            handleKeyEvent(keyEvent).
	        }
	    }
    
2. Using pattern matching + conditonal, downcasting in a `switch` statement:
	
		func handleEvent(e:Event) {
		    switch e {
		        case let mouseEvent as MouseEvent: handleMouseEvent(mouseEvent)
		        case let keyEvent as KeyEvent: handleKeyEvent(keyEvent)
		        default: print(""Don't know how to handle event \(e)"")

So if you're array has capacity of 81, any access of that array that is less than 0, 81 (because arrays start at 0), or higher will give you that error. Look at the line where the error is happening ( the line highlighted by xcode). Which array is it trying to access? What index is it using? How big is the array? These are the questions you need to ask yourself to fix this problem because I can guarantee you will see this happening many times in what we do.
For your situation, it looks like your trying to access arrPosition - 9 in mapNormal. Check what number that comes up with. If it's less than 0, then you know the problem.
Also I would advise you create a function that handles your check for array position. Try one that takes an array of numbers as a parameter, and compares them to see if they are equal or not to arrPosition (use a for loop). If they are all not equal,  you can return the proper boolean. It will clean up your code a bit and make these kinds of if statements less error prone.",1533302037.0

I’m not sure if you are interested in books at all, but for me “Advanced Swift” by the objc-io folks has been fantastic, if a little hard to understand at times. I would highly recommend all their books if you can swing it. They have supplemental videos and code you can look at as well.

The specification doesn't even say ""stack"" or ""heap"", and the implementation is welcome to use either structure (or something else entirely) as long as it follows the required semantics.  Right now, it happens to put smaller structs on the stack and larger ones on the heap (I don't remember the threshold), even when they're used in exactly the same way.

kawag,"No. Swift has its own, native types for things like Array, Dictionary and String. It compiles to machine code, like C/C++.

Pure Swift (e.g. on Linux) doesn’t use Obj-C at all since there is no Obj-C runtime on those platforms. On Apple platforms, you may see the odd call to handle potentially-bridged objects (e.g. a Swift String which is really a bridged NSString).

The Obj-C Foundation library is a wrapper around the C library CoreFoundation. The Swift Foundation library is its own wrapper, sitting alongside Obj-C foundation and using the same underlying C library.

„Non-pure“ Swift occurs when you’re using Obj-C libraries (e.g. UIKit). In that case, you’re trying to call functionality that is written in Obj-C, so Swift will ensure that, for example, classes get registered with the Obj-C runtime so you can do things like KVO. But when it isn’t _directly_ calling to functionality written in Obj-C, it will do its own thing.

Swift code that uses Objective-C objects is compiled down to a format that is interfacable with the objective-c runtime. This is one of the things that people refer to when they say ABI. So for example, the Swift `UIViewController` subclass that you write is going to have calls to `super.viewDidLoad` and what not that compiles down to machine instructions that calls the Objective-C runtime library via the same `objc_msgSend` that the Objective-C programming language uses.

thisischemistry,"[RandomAccessCollection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/randomaccesscollection)

> Random-access collections can move indices any distance and measure the distance between indices in O(1) time. Therefore, the fundamental difference between random-access and bidirectional collections is that operations that depend on index movement or distance measurement offer significantly improved efficiency. For example, a random-access collection’s count property is calculated in O(1) instead of requiring iteration of an entire collection.

You can't meet that guarantee. Every time the `startIndex` and `endIndex` are checked they have to go through every key and look for the min and max. That's O(n). Also, the distance should be the total number of indices between the start and end, not simply the difference between the min and max - unless every index between min and max is used. If I want to walk from one end to the other I should be able to do so `count` times and the distance should be the same as `count`.

You have to supply an implementation for the [`indices `](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/randomaccesscollection/2803147-indices) property. The default one gives the range `startIndex..<endIndex` so it won't work with your code. Even though you return a default value for missing indices they are still missing and are not valid.

I'm pretty sure this implementation is overkill and will be very difficult to work with. The whole point of an array is indexed access to contained values. Hiding those indices behind default values makes very little sense. So now every time you want a proper value you have to check that the index is correct?

andredp,"First of all, let me warn you that there is no perfect / unique / better solution to that problem. It's very good that you're trying to solve it but you should have clear objectives about what you want to achieve (in your case, lighten the View Controller and separate responsibilities).

So, one example of what you want to achieve is (assuming your table shows Cars):

* Car
* CarDataSource
* CarTableViewController
* ~~CarTableView~~ (I don't know if you use Interface Builder or not... If you use maybe you have your @IBOutlet in your VC instead of a view...) -> I will assume you use, because that's what most people do. Just know that you can play a lot more with architecture if you do views by code.

Your ViewController is basically a connector. It is a delegate for everything but just passes info around (try to avoid having complex logic in the VC):

    class CarTableViewController: UIViewController {
    
      let carDataSource = CarDataSource()
      var cars = [Car]()
    
      override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    
        self.tableView.delegate = self
        self.tableView.dataSource = self
        
        self.carDataSource.delegate = self
        self.carDataSource.fetchCars()
      }
    }
    
    extension CarTableViewController: CarDataSourceDelegate {
      func onFetched(cars: [Car]) {
        self.cars = cars
        self.tableView.reloadData()
      }
    }
    
    extension CarTableViewController: UITableViewDataSource {
      // ... fill the tableView with the cars array
    }
    
    extension CarTableViewController: UITableViewDelegate {
      // handle things like didSelect, etc...
    }

---
    protocol CarDataSourceDelegate {
      func onFetched(cars: [Car])
    }
        
    struct CarDataSource {
        
      weak var delegate: CarDataSourceDelegate?
        
      performApiRequest(callback: @escaping () -> [Car]) {
        // a lot of code...
      }
        
      func fetchCars() {
        performApiRequest() { cars in
          self.delegate?.onFetched(cars: cars)
        }
      }
    }

From what I realise is pretty much what you have now. Remember, the ViewController has the responsibility to control (orchestrate/connect) things around... Don't try to remove **EVERYTHING** from the View Controller just because medium.com said so. They should be light but they exist for a reason.

---

**EDIT:** If you code your views you can make your `CarTableView` the UITableView delegate and dataSource and create a protocol for the ViewController to be delegate and pass the needed data / answer to the events triggered. For instance:

    // A CarTableViewDelegate has to be a UITableViewDataSource
    protocol CarTableViewDelegate: UITableViewDataSource {
      func onCarSelected(index: Int)
    }
    
    class CarTableView: UIView {
    
      let tableView: UITableView = {
        let view = UITableView()
        // configure table view
        return view
      }()
    
      weak var delegate: CarTableViewDelegate {
        didSet {
          // delegates data source operations to the CarTableViewDelegate (in this case the VC)
          self.tableView.dataSource = self.delegate
        }
      }
    
      init() {
        self.tableView.delegate = self
        super.init(...)
      }

      /// Mimic Array append

      /// No-parameter init
      init()

      typealias Index = Array<Element>.Index

      var startIndex: Index { return items.startIndex }
      var endIndex  : Index { return items.endIndex   }

      func index(after i: Index) -> Index {
        return items.index(after: i)

        items.append(newElement)

      init() { self.items = [Element]() }

      private var items: [Element]
    }

This gains all the free goodness of a `MutableCollection`, just like the internal `Array` does. It forwards the appropriate calls to the internal `Array` and those calls can be intercepted and modified as needed. This can be seen in the `get(_:)` method where it checks for the existence of an index before using it to get the value contained at that index.

Doing it like this leverages all the default implementations that come with a `MutableCollection`. It also works with any code that expects a `MutableCollection`. It's safe, fairly straightforward to extend, and it follows the conventions of most of the rest of the Swift codebase. This is the Swift way of doing things.",1533185791.0

\- Xamarin is used mostly for Hybrid development, like some people have said in the thread: there aren't that many employers for Xamarin compared to other technologies, but still, you might want to be a niche, it's nobody's business but your own.

\- Xamarin projects differ from one another, I've seen many approaches. You'll have to get yourself familiar with architectural patterns, and those don't really depend on a specific language. You might see very commonly people using MVVM on Xamarin, along with tools such as MVVMCross. If you know what's MVVM, MVP and MVC, you'll be fine.

\- Xamarin has a tool called Xamarin.Forms, that is used to write the code for the interfaces only once. If you're not using Xamarin.Forms you'll probably be using iOS functions in C#, and most of these functions are translations of their Swift/Obj-C counterparts.

As you can see, it would be very interesting for you to learn more about programming before making a compromise and sticking to a single platform. As you said, you're a baby dev, you should be taking and creating the opportunities that are most beneficial for you at the moment. Would you say no if someone offered you a job working with Xamarin and C# right now?

Well, in any case, I'd tell you to go and learn Swift before Xamarin as it'll give you a better understanding of the design  and architectural patterns in iOS. As well as get yourself familiar with the functions available in the platform, as you'll be mostly using their translations in Xamarin.

ewmailing,"Disclaimer: Appcelerator (the original company behind Titanium) was an angel investor for one of my previous companies. I worked closely with them in that time period with things regarding the core Titanium design.

Titanium is a cross-platform native app SDK which allows its users to write in JavaScript. It provides JavaScript language bridge with a large set of libraries. You can write in JavaScript to write native-ish apps. The library APIs you call are accessible in JavaScript, but they use language bindings to cross into the platform’s native language (Objective-C on iOS) to call the correct APIs. On iOS, they use JavaScriptCore as the JavaScript VM. (On Android, they used V8, but while I was there, the plan was to switch to JSCore for all platforms and I helped them port JSCore to Android. But I was recently told they never switched so they still have different VMs for each platform.)


Language bindings aren’t new stuff and this technique has been done many times before for many different languages. Apple used to have first class support for PyObjC and RubyCocoa back in Mac OS X 10.5, where you can write native Cocoa apps in Python or Ruby. (There was even Interface Builder integration.) I wrote the world’s first full-featured full Lua bridge called LuaCocoa using the same techniques as PyObjC and RubyCocoa (thanks to some kind help from the RubyCocoa creator to point me in right direction). There was even a JavaScript bridge years before Titanium called JSCocoa. And today, there is yet another JavaScript bridge called React Native (which sadly didn’t learn from Titanium’s hard lessons, like with thread design).

Titanium’s first distinctive feature was they created a large set of (mostly) cross-platform APIs in JavaScript that would work on iOS and Android. Unlike PyObjC/RubyCocoa/LuaCocoa/JSCocoa where you would call native Cocoa APIs directly (akin to how you call Obj-C Cocoa APIs in Swift), they invented an API abstraction layer so their APIs could work on iOS and Android (but conversely look like neither iOS nor Android).

Cross-platform API abstraction layers aren’t a new thing either. There are lots. However, *natvie* cross-platform abstraction layers for GUIs (those which call native widget sets) are fairly rare. So this is the other distinctive feature of Titanium. (React Native makes a lot of noise in this area, but when you get into the devil of the details, it becomes debatable, like TableViews.) But there are some. I’m currently implementing new backends for a C based library called IUP, which is designed with the intent that it can be used by almost any language (not locked into a single language like JavaScript). 



So for the most part, forking Titanium probably won’t do what you think it does. It already calls native Cocoa deep under the hood. There is a some what thick JavaScript layer between you and native though. If your goal is to remove/replace the JavaScript parts, that is not going to work as it is inseparable. (Again, this is one of my motivations for working on IUP because I’m sick if these massive, inseparable, dependencies.)


There is a little confusion and ambiguity on the “compiled” aspect of Titanium. Another project I was somewhat involved with at Appcelerator was their Hyplerloop compiler. This would allow you to write directly in JavaScript code but call native Cocoa/Obj-C APIs without writing any language binding code. The Hyperloop compiler would automatically generate the language binding code. This is somewhat closer to PyObjC/RubyCocoaLuaCocoa/JSCocoa where you now write directly to the native platform APIs which can be more efficient (a big problem when I was there was their homegrown language bridge was very thick and slow). But it still must interpret all the JavaScript at runtime, so you still have the JSCore VM. But the generated binding code should be close to as efficient as you can get within the limitations of runtime language bindings.


As for your job, you should find out what you are going to be doing. If they need people to continue writing/maintaining their Titanium apps, then you will be writing in JavaScript and against Titanium’s custom APIs. In this case, you will not be using Objective-C or Swift, and you will not be directly calling CocoaTouch APIs. (But an understanding of CocoaTouch will at least give you a mental model of how the Titanium APIs work.)

If they need people to write iOS Titanium modules with Hyperloop, then your CocoaTouch knowledge will be more handy. You will need to learn JavaScript and you will have to write in JavaScript, but knowledge of the CocoaTouch frameworks is crucial.

If they need people to write native iOS Titanium modules by hand, then your CocoaTouch and Obj-C knowledge will be useful. (Swift modules won’t be viable until after the Swift ABI becomes stable. It will also depend on Titanium’s support for Swift.)

If your job is to help them figure a migration path away from Titanium, then there are probably a lot of opportunities for you to do lots of different things. 


As for whether you should take the job, unless you have a better offer, you should probably take it. If you want to be good in this industry, remember that your job is to solve problems, not be a code monkey tied specific language or framework. Take advantage of any opportunities to grow to be a better engineer/problem solver.

thisischemistry,"This is a very efficient way to do a permute. It's pretty functional, the only thorny part is the `temp` I had to create to carry over the result to the next iteration. I'll have to look at it further, I have a few ideas how to trim that down and make it much more functional.

    extension MutableCollection where Self.Index == Int {
      private func permute(end: Self.Index) -> [Self] {
        // uses Heap's Algorithm
        precondition((self.startIndex...self.endIndex).contains(end),
                     ""End index out of range."")
        guard end > self.startIndex else { return [self] }

        return (0..<end).reduce(into: [Self]() ) {
          $0 += temp.permute(end: end - 1)

            temp.swapAt($1, end - 1)

            temp.swapAt(0, end - 1)
          }
        }
      }

      func permute() -> [Self] { return permute(end: self.endIndex) }

**edit:**

Fixed an error where 

    if end % 2 == 0 {

should have been:

    if end % 2 == 1 {

Also made the code extend `MutableCollection` instead of `Array`. Theoretically it could extend `Collection` but then I'd have to code around the loss of `swapAt()`.

With all my love and respect to JetBrains and their products, AppCode is difficult to make work well in big projects, especially ones that mix both Swift and Objective-C. Indeed, all the good and nice refactoring features we know and love from IntelliJ are there, but at the price of an unnecessarily heavy IDE, which 50% of the time does not even show you hints and completions, unless you rebuild from scratch every time. 

I am saying this not because I think it is JetBrains’ fault, and neither doe I think that Apple is 100% to blame for this. The truth is that as much as we try to stay away from XCode, there is no moving forward without it, and this is the state of affairs at the moment.

Pro's: 

The editor is awesome, and has a vim mode for us older hacks. Unit testing platform is great.

If you've grown tired of Xcode nagging you that the variable you just created hasn't been used anywhere **AND YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH IT NOW!!!!!** You'll really like AppCode.

Con's:

Noobs will feel lost. Every training program I've seen focuses on Xcode and have never had one even mention AppCode. 

My current workflow:

Create new projects in Xcode. Work the storyboards, and get IB connections laid out. Do some basic coding.

Switch to AppCode and write Unit Tests, and start serious coding.

Learning a programming language, any kind of programming language, or programming in general, is **not** easy. But it's **not** hard either. I believe everybody is capable to be a good programmer. It's all depend on how well you comprehend logic and data structure. 

However, the hardest part of programming is not the syntax (the rule of the language), but the implementation of the language into a real application. Once you know the syntax of a language, learning another language would be quite fast and easy. But the way you build an application in one language is quite different when you switch to another language. 

Building a real application requires you to also understand how to utilize the RTL (runtime library) and common SDK (software development kit) that come along with the language. Every programming language has its own pack of RTL and SDKs with their own rules of usage that sometimes are more complex than the language itself. Learning them is the real problem. 😊 ",1532829516.0

Once you've done that, just refactor your code to create a UIBezierPath using those same calculations while setting the control xPos halfway (or near that) between the points and set the yPos equal to its CGPoint's yPos.

In Swift there are 3 main object types: `struct`, `enum`, `class`. They are wrappers around properties and associated methods.

The differences between them are:

- `struct`
  - value type: when passed around you get a copy and not a reference
  - can have a synthesized initializer method
  - can not have a stored property of their own same type
- `enum`
  - value type: when passed around you get a copy and not a reference
  - cannot have any stored properties, only computed properties
  - preset instances which can not be changed
  - they can have a default raw value of another type (comes with a synthesized initializer method)
  - instances can hold associated data if they do not have a default raw value
  - can have associated data of their own same type
- `class`
  - reference type: passing around an instance creates a reference
  - can have stored properties with their own same type

All the Swift types are fixed at compilation time, they can't have properties or methods added on the fly.

Now my JavaScript is very rusty. However, from what I remember I'd say they all fulfill some of what JavaScript objects do, with `class` being the closest since both a Swift `class` and a JavaScript object are reference types. ",1532553075.0
Slypenslyde,"This is hard to answer without getting super into a lot of details. The short story is: nothing in Swift is *the equivalent* of JS objects.

(I'm going to ignore inheritance and a few other exotic Swift features for simplicity.)

JS objects are weird, amorphous things you reference and can add properties to on a whim. If I ask you for ""an object"", I have no clue what you're giving me. So generally I have to ask you for, ""an object but make sure it has these properties"". You can put more properties on that object than I ask for and it's fine, but if you don't give me exactly the ones I expect stuff goes wrong. And I don't have a really good way to tell you that other than documentation. I can also choose to add properties to it. If I tell you that, you can use those properties. No problem. And if I stop adding those properties without telling you, you're hosed and may not know.

Swift structs are defined ahead of time, and are not reference types. (More on that later.) The important difference here is even Swift classes are defined ahead of time. You don't add properties later. So when I ask for a `Person`, it has to be a specific `Person` struct with specific properties. You can't give me anything else. Your code won't even compile if you try. And if I want to add some properties to the `Person` you give me, I can't. I have to return some different struct with a different name so you know, with guarantees, what properties it has.

JS sort of makes an equivalence between objects and dictionaries, which is why this works. Swift doesn't have that kind of context.

Now, the distinction between ""value"" and ""reference"" also matters.

Let's say I have a Swift struct called `Apple`. I'm holding it in my hand, it's an apple. Now let's say I want an apple in my other hand. I have to grab a different apple. Maybe it's the same kind, weight, shape, etc. as my first one, but it's important that there are two hands holding two different apples. There is no way I can hold one `Apple` in two hands in this metaphor. It just doesn't work. This is what we call a ""value type"". Structs *are* the values they represent, and every variable refers to a unique struct.

JS objects are reference types. So if I have a JS `Apple` in one hand, it's more like there is a crate with many apples in it somewhere, each numbered. I have a piece of paper in my hand with a '3' on it. So if you ask me which apple is mine, I tell you the one numbered 3. Metaphorically, I hold the apple in my hand, even though realistically I hold a piece of paper. Now, imagine I get a new piece of paper and write '3' on it, and put it in the other hand. Now, each hand holds something that represents an apple. But both hands represent the *same* apple. That's how reference types work. The variables are not the thing itself, but instead are more like the address where that thing lives. So for reference types, you can have many variables that share the same underlying thing.

Swift classes are reference types. So they are more like JS objects than structs. But it's still true that both structs and classes are predefined things with a fixed set of properties and functions. If you try to pass something that isn't EXACTLY the type a function expects, Swift won't compile. JS is a lot more wishy-washy. Classes exist, but they're just a formality over object construction. It's only through tools like Typescript that JS objects start to feel like Swift structs/classes.

",1532565699.0
Nobody_1707,"To start with, JavaScript objects are all reference types, so if you pass an object into a function and then modify it then the changes will be visible anywhere else that has a reference to that object.

For instance:

    let foo = { id: 3, name: ""Romana"" };
    const bar = baz => baz.name = ""Fred"";
    console.log(foo.name); // ""Romana""
    bar(foo);
    console.log(foo.name); // ""Fred""

Whereas structs are value types, so whenever you modify a struct passed into a function, only that function's copy of the struct is changed.

    struct Foo {
        var id: Int
        var name: String
    }
    
    func bar(_ baz: Foo) {
        // Function parameters are immutable, so you need
        // make a mutable binding before you can actually make any changes.
        // In practice there shouldn't be any actual copying involved.
        var baz = baz
        baz.name = ""Fred""
    }
    
    var foo = Foo(id: 3, name: ""Romana"")
    print(foo.name) // ""Romana""
    bar(foo)
    print(foo.name) // ""Romana""

The closest thing in Swift to JavaScript objects would be `class`es which are also reference types.

In addition, all JavaScript objects are effectively a dictionary of `[String: Any]` (`foo[""name""]` is exactly equivalent to `foo.name`, and you can even add new properties like this), so it's very easy to dynamically add properties to any given object. Properties in Swift can only be added to a type as a whole, and stored properties can only be placed in a type's main definition.

If you want a more thorough guide to how types and variables work in Swift then I suggest you read the [language guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) and [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read).",1532552580.0
thr4wst,"This answer is much more simplistic than the others, I came from JavaScript too and there’s still a lot in the Swift language that I don’t fully leverage.

DrFloyd5,"They are similar in the sense that you have a bunch of values (properties) referenced by a single variable.

aVariable.aValue = “hi”

But in JavaScript you build the object on the fly. Attaching chucks of code to dynamically allocated properties.

In swift you define the class ahead of time and the compiler handles all the “building”. You don’t get the dynamic behavior. (Unless you work for it, but it gets messy fast.)

This [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher–Yates_shuffle) is pretty simple. Pick the last element in the array, swap it with a random element. Pick the next-to-last element, swap it with a random element. Repeat until you've tried every position.

1|2|3|4|5

Take last, pick a random position (1), swap:

0|1|2|3|4

Take second-to-last, pick a random position (0), swap:

0|1|2|3|4

Third last, pick a random position (0), swap:

0|1|2|3|4

Lungboy74,"Looks good, some tips from a purely personal perspective:
When I am looking at intern level resumes, I usually am trying to gauge how much coaching they will require when they join.
If you are trying to secure an iOS internship, you may want to break out the skills for iOS into more detail. What versions of swift have you used, what frameworks have you used? (Networking, core data, collection views...)  
I know the technologies my projects use and don’t expect an intern to join with experience in them, but if your resume checks a few boxes for tech we already use, you have a good chance of being shortlisted.

Another couple things you may want to study up on are strengths and weaknesses of MVC pattern (google: massive viewcontroller) a passing knowledge of MVVM or VIPER can be interesting.

Unit tests, they suck as they feel like a waste of time.  For intermediate to senior positions many know the right answer is to say they are important and why, but few actually use them and can explain best practices.

Last piece of advice for this as well as any position you apply for, try to tailor your resume as much as possible for the position posted and send a cover letter.  Some managers don’t even read them, but a good cover letter can be a foot in the door and should be customized for each position.  It is your chance to explain why they should interview you over any other candidate.

frouge,"I believe every use case can have a different answer.

Here are different approaches I see:

* A database
* The UserDefaults
* Why not in the top level view controller?
* Singleton can be fine
* A file",1532445159.0
michaelallenkelso,"I think the best thing for you to do would be to start to find a groove mentally as far what *type of situation* asks for which *type of data storage.*

At a high level, yes, you have a good view of the choices. Which are basically...

1. Pass a value to the view controller, allow the view controller to send an update back up if the view controller modifies the data
2. Store the value as a singleton everyone can access and touch

Sure, behind these storage methods maybe you got your data by fetching from an API, or by reading from UserDefaults, but that I believe is more specific to your use case. 

So between creating an instance of the data model everywhere, or passing the data around as a segue, maybe you could use this as a framework...

**If** **you have super-shared, not-really-owned-by-anyone data** (Like, maybe, some data about the API endpoints you want your front end to request from, or a ""requests manager"" that does specific HTTP things you like, etc, **store that as a singleton or, if you can get away with it, static variables that don't even need to be initialized to be accessed.**

**If you have data that is being examined in detailed contexts** (like, maybe, a notes app where you have a master>detail situation with a list of notes, and then you push in view controllers where you can edit the notes, or a similar thing where users have a set of projects or a single project and modify different sections in detail view controllers, **become familiar with ""delegate"" patterns so you can pass the data to a child view controller, set the parent view controller as the somethingSomethingDelegate of the child view controller, and allow the child view controller to call a function on the delegate methods of the parent view controller to really precisely send back up the updated object so the parent view controller can save it, refresh the list, etc.**

nielsbot,"Value types guarantee one type of thread safety. Thread safety means different things. Some examples:

- avoiding deadlocks
- avoiding race conditions
- ensuring correctness when data is shared between threads. 

Using value types (structs) helps with the last item since you're guaranteed that a value type you've shared with another thread cannot be mutated (changed) from another thread. In fact, values types can't be mutated at all as long as they are declared `let`.

Interesting thing about Swift: All types are considered value types! `Int`, `String`, anything declared `struct`, *and* even references types. How can that be? Turns out a reference is a value itself--It's a value that contains a reference to another value. :) Swift sort of hides this from you by making references convenient to work with... 

HTH",1532403716.0
chrabeusz,"In provided example, struct does not really give you anything. You can have race conditions with struct too:

    func makeRaceCondition() {
        struct Foo {
            var value = 1
            
            mutating func mutate() {
                value += 1
            }
        }
        
        var a = Foo()
        
        for _ in 0..<100 {

                a.mutate()
            }
        }
    }

This is because declared variable `a` will be allocated on heap so that other threads can access it.

But, you can use copy semantics to implement cool stuf for threading purposes, for example:

    /// If T is a struct, then this class provides thread safety, because all reads and writes happen inside queue.
    /// But, if T is very big, copying it may decrease performance.
    /// If T was a mutable reference type, this class would be basically useless.

Jakoneitor,"I’m not sure about Auth, but the rest is just the same as you’d on web. Do POST/GET requests from your iOS app to your backend and that’s about it. You may want to use alamofire for that.",1532372327.0
alb1616,"If you understand how to send requests via a browser then that part is pretty simple. You just need to configure a request with the type and your data, send it off and wait for a response.

They have some good examples on their GitHub page [https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md)

The Hacking with Swift Vapor book covers building  server side apps in swift. I managed to put together an app with basic auth a while ago using it.

The routes on your server app can deal with auth, e.g:

/register route takes request object with a username and password, checks if there's a matching username in the database and returns a response object (success or fail) - your iOS app can look at the response and save the user details or ask for different ones

if its a valid new user, the server app will save the (encrypted) details to the database

/login route can take a req object with username and password, check they both match whats in the database and return a response object with a token if correct - your iOS app can save the token and use it for making get requests, etc.

/get routes can take a request object containing a token (amongst other things). if the token matches a valid one in the database, the data can be sent back

same for post, delete route

You need to be careful and use encryption/password hashing.

I too did a node course and was left utterly confused by this. Now I've covered the basics, I think I'll be ready to figure out using libraries like OAuth for more secure authentication.",1532425003.0
alb1616,"Yes, getting data to and from the server can be done with alamofire.

It’s good practise to not store the users password as plain text. Instead you can store a hash of it. 

JWTs can, amongst other things, be used like a cookie in the browser. If the user has a valid token they don’t need to send their password with every request. 

Depending on your use case, you may want to encrypt data that you store on the server and / or data that you’re sending over the network.

jasamer,"It isn't really a memory leak, but it kind of looks like one. Also, the fix might seem a little like black magic.

Memory management in Foundation uses `autorelease` from time to time. This used to be quite common. What `autorelease` basically means is ""release this memory later"". This is done in the next runloop cycle; basically, when all your methods have finished. `replacingOccurences` allocates a string somewhere in its code, and autoreleases it. It is never actually released within your loop, because that'll happen ""later"" (after you're done with all your stuff). If you had this code in an iOS app, for example, it would deallocate all that memory when the loop and all of your code is done running.

But then again, your iOS app would probably also crash on the device, because it ran out of memory. So, fortunately, there is a way to trigger releasing of autoreleased memory: `autoreleasepool { someCode }`. The `autoreleasepool` function will run `someCode `, then collect all memory that was autoreleased in `someCode` (In your case, it's `replacingOccurrences` that does the autoreleasing).

So, to fix your memory consumption issue:

    for n in 1...5_000_000 {
        let numStr = String(describing: n)
        var result = """"
        autoreleasepool {
            result = testText.replacingOccurrences(of: ""X"", with: numStr)
        }
        print(result)

We had a lot of time allocated for learning languages and platforms that we were interested in apart from what we were learning in our courses which were more general. I decided to learn Objective-C and build programs for OS X. It was very difficult at first for many reasons but in my second year or so I took a course in development for Android. It was very basic and pretty useless but that's when I figured out that I wanted to combine what I knew from OS X development with what I learned from Android development and start building iOS apps. I had an iPhone since the get go so it was just a matter of opening up a project and learn by doing.

In my third and final year I decided to start looking for full time jobs to be prepared for the fall. One thing let to another and suddently I had signed a contract for an iOS developer role at a newspaper company. I had an exam to go as well as the scientific paper to get my degree. After the final exam I went home and the next morning I went to work for the first time. I was writing the paper with my best friend (today an Android developer at the same company) and he was able to shoulder most of the conclusion of the paper. I love him for many reasons and this is one of them. I'm really sorry to have made such rash decisions but it turned out great in the end. I did of course help but it's one of those things I regret in life.

Shitty feels aside, at my then new job I was working with four iOS consultants. I made it my mission to learn as much as possible by picking their brains and one in particular taught me more in the first few months than three years at university did. I got to be a part of the digitalization of the second largest newpaper in my country and it was really exciting. During the time I was there we went from a simple web wrapper to a template population technique we stole from The Guardian and finally to a fully native experience. It taught me so much about iOS, agile methodologies, testing and programming in general. It was also extremely fun.

I learned old school pre-ARC objC iOS sometime after I learned jQuery. I’ve kept up to date on Node, VueJS, Express, etc. I also diddle with Vapor as a server-side swift tinker project.

iOS has never been more accessible than ever thanks to swift. Your real pain point is going to be learning Xcode. (And Xcode is more accessible than ever, as well.)

I recommend learning “vanilla” iOS dev. Don’t bother with Nativescript or ReactNative.

Areas that will be learning curves:

1.	Binding UI to code with interface builder. It’s easy, unless something goes wrong. And then you’ll be making a trip to stack overflow.
2.	Concurrency / threads. JavaScript doesn’t really have this pattern. iOS does. You may not hit topic straight away.
3.	Any hardware stuff you might be doing with cameras, 3D, Bluetooth, WiFi, AR, Face recognition, motion, audio. It’s just stuff that most web devs don’t do because browser support is lacking or inconsistent.

I wouldn't recommend starting with Javascript based frameworks like  React Native or Vue, because while they're very advanced nowadays they intentionally abstract over the implementation of most basic things by creating their own post-compile native code, assuming that when you do need to tweak something in Obj-C, you'll know enough Swift, Obj-C *and* the Javascript framework to get over a hurdle.",1532222659.0

Seriously.

Like CSS, auto layout can be shitty at the beginning, but then, it’s easy once you get the hang of it.

It’s very cool to have everything made by one company, and the fact that you don’t have to teach the browser everything from the beginning, plus it’s an application and not a document, so navigation and modal dialogs are easier to do in my opinion.

If you want to have JavaScript code, which is a good idea if you have to make an Android or Windows version, you can load your JS to a virtual machine (think of an invisible web page that only has JS) and interface with that VM.

Cool thing compared to web development is that you don’t lose the virtual machine with a page change.

Remember that it’s Apple, the same engine that runs JS in Safari is running JS in iOS.

This is the equivalent of a browser.

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore/jscontext

No one course has it all, and even if it did... you'd pick new things up by going through it several times... so might as well do that with multiple courses to get different perspectives.

thisischemistry,"You should absolutely be concerned. The differences between being an actual employee and an independent contractor are vast. First of all, an independent contractor has far less legal protections in most jurisdictions. You can be fired more easily, they don't have to provide you with the same level of benefits, you aren't covered the same under their liability and other professional insurances. You'll have to file and handle the tax issues yourself.

Generally, a company uses independent contractors as a way to trim their responsibilities down. They can make grand promises and then not deliver on them because many new independent contractors don't know how to get a proper legal and binding agreement. The company often has lawyers who are very good at writing these kinds of agreements to be against the contractor.

The fact that they brought you in with the promise of an internship and then they pull a bait-and switch of ""oh, you'd make a great independent contractor instead"" speaks volumes to their intent. They probably planned this all along and are trying to play it up as a positive for you when there's pretty much no upside.

Now, if you were a senior developer who was needed for a special project and you had years of experience at being an independent contractor then it would be a different story. You'd probably have a lawyer that checks contracts for you, you'd be able to demand proper compensation for not having health and other benefits that a permanent employee wound enjoy, they'd do what they could to accommodate your needs and keep you as long as they need your expertise. The balance of power would not be as tilted in their favor.

If you were qualified as an intern, you wouldn't be qualified as a professional.  There should be a clear gap between the two.

I would be concerned because you don't want a failure at this point.  I can't see a valid reason for them wanting to do this other than costs and various legal reasons.  It's a lot easier on a company to pay a contractor than it is to pay an employee.

I've done something similar recently and here's the approach I took in negotiating invites with Firebase:

Create your Firebase reference:

`let ref = Database.database().reference()`

**User 1**

* Create a new location in the database for TestGroup:

`ref.child(""groups"").child(""TestGroup"").setValue(true)`

* Add the invited user's ID to a list of all invitations. Each user will only look for their own ID in the list. Set the value to the group name.

`ref.child(""invites"").child(""User2"").setValue(""TestGroup"")`

**User 2**

* Listen for their ID in the invitations list and save the group name as /users/User2/groups/TestGroup

`ref.child(""invites"").child(""User2"").observe(.value) { (snapshot) in`  
`if snapshot.exists() {`  
`if let groupName = snapshot.value as? String {`  
`ref.child(""users"").child(""User2"").child(""groups"").child(groupName).setValue(true)`  
`   }`  
`}`  
`}`

Now both User 1 and User 2 know the name of the group is TestGroup, and all groups are found in /groups/[name]/ in the database, so they know where to read/write.

    enumerateChildNodes(withName: <name>, closure: { ...MY CODE... } )

You can do this:

    enumerateChildNodes(withName: <name>) {
        ...MY CODE...
    }

I think this was inspired by Ruby syntax...

Official Apple documentation about this [here](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html#ID102)",1531984397.0
soulchild_,"Disclaimer: I don't have experience on Sprite Kit

I searched Apple official documentation for the enumerateChildNodes function here : https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sknode/1483024-enumeratechildnodes .

The `enumerateChildNode` function take in two parameters, `withName` and the closure (yes, the closure is the parameter passed into it). 

Normally you would do it like 

    enumerateChildNodes(withName: ""BADBOI"", using: { (node: SKNode, nil) in
    ...
    })


Swift language has a shortcut for when a function take in a closure on the last (rightmost) parameter (the `using` parameter in this case), you can move it to the end of the function like this:  

    // as a shortcut, you can move the last closure parameter to outside of function call
    enumerateChildNodes(withName: ""BADBOI"") { (node: SKNode, nil) in
    ...
    }

Hope this helps! If you are interested to read in detail about this, I have written an overview about closure here : https://fluffy.es/closure-overview/#parameter",1531984406.0

Should be

    { (node:SKNode, _) in ... }

Also, Swift can determine the types of most variables and closure arguments without you having to specify them, so this probably works:

```swift
enumerateChildNodes( withName: ""BADBOI"" ) { node, _ in
    ...

1.   IPad is not a good place to code, especially without an external keyboard.   Beyond that there are limited programming environments to allow much of any learning.
2. A Mac Book actually supports a huge number of programming environments.    There is Apples Xcode of course but you can leverage a number of IDE's, editors and other programming tools.   Mac OS is actually a great developers platform so you are good to go in that regard.
3. IPad can help you code if your goal is to target iOS and the iPad.    This simply because you can test code there.    You didn't mention if your goal is to build apps for iOS devices or if you are trying to develop more general programming skills so this could be important to you.
4. What iPad is very good at in my opinion is providing a second screen to support your Mac.   This could be especially useful on a Mac Book with its small screen.   Before I busted my iPad early this year i would use it to display API's and such basically as a reference manual.   Prop the iPad right next to the mains screen and you have a unobstructed view of the information related to your programming task.     I say information because I have had reference manuals and algorithms displayed to help with code implementation.

Even if you get a first job, it likely won’t pay enough the first year to make up for your early losses and instead it’ll likely be more stressful than is healthy when you’re trying to learn something that’s quite hard.

Also, what I’ve found is that once I got past the basics, my rate of learning decreased dramatically, I no longer learn at the rate in which I code but instead it’s related to the time I dedicate to studying, reading documentation, software design, which is all stuff I do throughout the day so there isn’t much more time for pure learning now that I’m a full time dev than I’ve had in the past.

IAmPapap,"I'll tell you how I did it. Whether it directly relates to you or not I am not certain. I did similar to you and just started learning on my own. I had dabbled in ObjC and wrote some small test apps (never published) but didn't really get into iOS development until the Swift beta was released. As soon as I used it I knew Swift iOS development was my next career path. I spent two years learning Swift and writing several apps. Most of them have never seen the light of day, but I did publish a couple of them (I have have since removed them for various reasons). Once I felt that I could develop in Swift and had a pretty good understanding of developing in iOS (including, but not limited to, understanding the application lifecycle, basic architecture, different methods of showing and gathering information including labels, buttons, table views, date pickers, alert view controllers, nav controllers, etc.), I started talking with job recruiters. The fact that I had 25+ years of development experience already in various languages and platforms surely helped me and I landed a one year contract within a couple of months. I could have gotten something sooner, but I was specifically looking for a longer term contract or perm job because I was leaving a 15 year career at large outsourcing company (and, no, they did not have iOS jobs). It was actually a pay raise of about $30K/year, but there were major trade-offs. No insurance of any kind (pretty typical for a contract), and the job was on-site out-of-state. But, I felt that the trade-offs were well worth it for the job that I was hoping would help me land future work as an iOS dev. I had a serious case of feeling under-qualified when I started, but I was working with an amazing team. The lead dev knew immediately that I wasn't really a senior iOS dev as the job had called for, but also didn't care because he felt that I knew more than enough to keep up and learn quickly. They ended up offering me a perm job after three months, but I didn't want to move so I stayed on as a contractor until the year-long contract was up. I now have a perm job back in my home state working on a very interesting iOS project and have several years of iOS experience to fall back on.

The TL;DR here is that once you feel that you have the Swift skills necessary (and I would highly recommend following through on that plan to get an app or two out the door first because you need something to show during interviews), then talk to the recruiters. Do a few interviews. That will tell you where your strengths  and weaknesses are. Work on those and then keep trying. Don't leave your current job until you land the next one. And be picky! You already have a job, so don't take the first Swift job to come along. Find a job that you think you can learn from and do not get into a place where you are the only iOS dev.

If this is not possible I would have a quick google and find some job specs to get an idea of what would be involved / expected. 

Gear your learning to what you find and try to build a number of small apps which touch on single / focused parts of the specs. This will give you a deeper understanding to a number of different smaller requirements without overwhelming you. When you are feeling more confident I would then look to build an app which would touch on as many aspects as possible, plugging all the bits together. 

If you finish the larger app and are still interested then you have a small portfolio of apps you can bring up in discussion for interviews. This will show your dedication, willingness to learn and the approach you took to get to your end goal. It will also give you smaller goals to aim towards throughout your learning process, hopefully keeping you motivated. 

Give a few interviews a go after this to see how they go and use them all as a learning environment to get a feel for what you are moving into to see if it still appeals to you. Take away the parts which you struggled on and gear your learning towards those points and try again.

You just need to weigh up salary vs satisfaction. As mentioned you may have to seek a more junior role to begin with which may come with a pay hit, just make sure you are comfortable with the move you are making!",1531851387.0

Eoghain,"Can't you just use the UISegmentedController to change the data that is used to display the cells to the proper type and reload the cells?  Maybe I'm missing something, but what I see is as simple as having 4 types of cells (corresponding to the UISegmentedController segments) and when the user changes the selected segment the UICollectionView is told that it's data has changed and it needs to reload based on the new type.

Here is a super quick and dirty `UICollectionViewController` that does what I'm talking about.  In my storyboard I've defined 4 cells matching the `reuseIdentifier` that I've got here, and a header view that has a segmented control that links to my `@IBAction`.  As you can see I just change the `reuseIdentifier` then tell my collection view to `reloadData`.

    class CollectionViewController: UICollectionViewController {

In other words, you can call on the value as if it isn't an `Optional`. If at any point it's `nil` then the chain stops and nil is returned. The end result is still an `Optional`.

What you're doing is using the fact that a flow control statement can use a comma-separated list of conditions and it will evaluate each of them until it finds one that doesn't either match a pattern or return `true`. If all the statements are executed then the flow will continue into the flow control statement's scope.

codytwinton,"# Swift Literals

This question is dealing with the topic of literals in Swift.

## Example

You can create a `String` type that represents an `Int` like so:

    var num = 123
    var numString = String(describing: num)

As you can see, the value provided for the `numString` variable is the Type followed by parenthesis, which will call the String initializer, passing in a single parameter: the type to be described as a `String`. The result will be this string: `""123""`.

However, you could accomplish this in a simpler way using the syntax sugar of literals:

    var numString = ""123""

Same result. Simpler syntax.

**Note:** Also, as a side note, `var num = 123` is itself using an Int literal. :D

## Array Literals

The Udemy tutorial is creating an array by explicitly initializing one: `var tracksArray: [SKSpriteNode]? = [SKSpriteNode]()`. However, similar to strings and ints, Arrays can be created with Array literals. This is what your provided code does:

    var tracksArray: [SKSpriteNode]? = []

## Explicit Typing for Empty Array Literals

As a final note, array literals can use type inference only when providing a non-empty array literal:

    var arr1 = [""Hello"", ""World""] // This will work, creating an array of type: `[String]`
    var arr2: [String] = [] // This also work, creating an empty array of type: `[String]`
    var arr3 = [String]() // This also work, creating an empty array of type: `[String]`
    
    var arr4 = [] // This will fail, since there is no context for inferring the type the array should contain",1531694037.0
CollegeBytes,"TL:DR;
var tracksArray: [SKSpriteNode]? =  [SKSpriteNode]()
// equals
var tracksArray: Array<SKSpriteNode>? = Array<SKSpriteNode>.init()

// because [SKSpriteNode] equals Array<SKSpriteNode>, which are types,
// not  [], which is a value literal: 1, “hi”, [:]

// but there is nothing wrong with
var tracksArray: [SKSpriteNode]? = []


More long winded version:


[SKSpriteNode] doesn’t not equal [] but instead is actually syntactic sugar for Array<SKSpriteNode>

So the right hand side is calling Array<SKSpriteNode>.init() to generate an empty array of SKSpriteNode. 

[] on the other hand is a an Array literal like how 1 and 2 can be Int literals. However, 1 & 2 can also be representations for a Double literals. Hence why you might do something like

let foo: Int = 1
let bar: Double = 2

But if you wanted to initialize using the init method it would look like

let foo = Int(1)

So why do both the : statement and the () init call? Well what if you want your variable to be an optional. 

You likely can’t call Int.init?(1) because your object might not an optional initializer so instead you take advantage of left hand assignments

let bar:Double? = Double(2)

I would start with having a collection of structs that represent you labels. This struct would contain a property for the label text and also a property for a list of image identifiers.

When you take the picture you will hold the image in memory and show your table view with a list of the labels. Your table view data source can be your collection of structs. Using this for your data source would also allow your table view to display a count of pictures with each label.

Once you click a label in the table view you would want to save your image to the file system using a unique image name. Then add that image name to the labels struct in the image identifiers list. 

After saving you can segue to another view. If you want a grid like display of thumbnails a collection view may be better than messing around with table view. When you argue you can pass the struct for the label that was clicked and use it as your data source. When creating the cells for the collection view you can load the image with the given identifier from disk and put it in an image view in the cell.

[www.raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com) and [App Coda](https://appcoda.com) are two awesome sites, start a beginner or intermediate course and work through the whole thing, at your own pace.  Make sure you actually write down every line of code and test the apps you build during the tutorials at every step.  Try to understand why things work and the patterns that apple uses in their language.  Many of the features you need will be taught in the tutorials.  

Optionally, take Stanford's intro programming course online, it teaches you the fundamentals in a way that's intended for future professionals.  Most of it will probably be review but if anything it teaches good habits in programming which is huge.  At some point in time someone is going to read your code, and they need to understand it.  The course will help you build your project on an intellectual framework that makes sense.  

Code, Code, Code.  Experience is the best teacher.  Every time you get an error, figure out what happened.  Try to do it yourself, it you can't then try stackoverflow (or just google it).

Use the docs from FireBase in combination with YouTube videos. There are tons of Youtube videos that cover the basics of FireBase. Personally i'd recommend watching LetsBuildThatApp or Briand Advent. They do some very good basic tutorials which should give you a headstart.

But theres one important bit, **don't** just copy the code from the video. Try to recognize the code from the doc's and compare it with the code from the video you are watching. Try to understand how the person implemented that bit of code you did not understand how to use. Then try it on your own. By just copying you won't learn anything at all. 

But most important is that you understand Swift at it's core first. ""guard let"" or ""weak var"" are not described in the docs of FireBase as they are native Swift functions (which are expected to be known). Remember, there's a big difference between knowing what for-loop is, but implementing in such a way that you can use it for your specific task is a never ending learning process. Compare it to math, knowing the rules of calculus does not mean you're able to derrive any function. It needs a lot of practicing.

After basically every first or second tutorial I read I got sth to add to my SharedCode framework which gets more and more mature so I can do high-level things without having to think about the minutia of

- adding and removing child view controllers, anchoring them with a toView argument
- creating an ErrorViewController
- creating a LoadingViewController
- CoreData stack loading from persistent from group, path or from inMemory
- Lots of CoreData helpers
- A generic CoreDataTableViewController showing data from NSFetchedResultsController, but only requiring giving an NSManagedObjectContext, an NSManagedType, a delegate and a celltype
- String helpers
- Device.uuid
- NSManagedObjectContext simplified fetching, reloading(fromContext:), loadOnlyOnce
- NSNotificationCenter messaging fatalErrors around by creating `FatalErrorNotification(error: error)` and posting it.

Then there are templates for NSManagedObjects to not have to type boilerplate and wrapper every time from scratch. Templates for controllers and ViewControllers. AppModel with AppController template. Lots more templates.

Then there are Code snippets I use regularly, like a TestCase snippet and other snippets I don’t want to remember how to write but want to simply put down. Templates are only for whole files and snippets for code blocks.

Thats what I came up with off the top of my head, all used today, which spared me writing these features again and again. The only problem with it is that its mixed iOS/macOS, so not all is available on both platforms so I have to expand it sometimes to the other platform which is no worry either.

What bit me today while working with `NSManagedObjectContext` was that I did not set `automaticallyMergeChangesFromParent = true` on the mainThread while making changes in a local backgroundThread. After coding it into the CoreData layer to do it automatically I do not have to worry about it again while using my CoreData layer in my SharedCode.`

If I were you I’d look at howto create child view controllers and get the adding into `add(_ child: NSViewController, toView: NSView)` and the removal to `remove()` which makes splitting things up so much simpler and pleasant overall.

Then learn some of the five https://davedelong.com/blog/2017/11/06/a-better-mvc-part-3-fixing-massive-view-controller/ to get an idea how your app’s architecture CAN look like. It’s a good starting point as any I guess.    
Note however that he only shows only sub-parts as examples and not the connection sub-part to overall app. You have to come up with that part yourself if you need it.

And don’t be shy of making new targets for EVERY TUTORIAL. In the beginning I didn’t like having many targets around and so tried to change my own tryout-target wherein I put everything. And I didn’t want to break things, which made trying things out very unpleasant.    
So now I create for every tutorial a new target where I set things up anew, even for small things so I don’t have to worry how I left the last tutorial off.    
And then after every tutorial I move the reusable parts to my SharedCode, which leaves the tutorial-target as a clean example calling into SharedCode for its functionality.    
Some examples I move to my SharedCodeTests cause I don’t want to break the part by accident later. That’s however only for small parts which are difficult to debug later, like why an NSNotification did not arrive, or that a ProxyCollection did not copy the dataSource, etc.",1531605522.0
ShottyMcKeith,"The crash is happening because the imagePassingDelegate is never getting set.

    var imagePassingDelegate : imagePassing!

That's an implicitly unwrapped variable (which is nil) so it's crashing as soon as you access it.

First of all, the delegate pattern is not a good fit for what you're trying to accomplish here. ViewController is instantiating the ImageViewController in 'didSelectItemAt' so you don't really need the protocol at all. ViewController could simply pass the image to ImageViewController before it presents it.

Second, you have some fundamental issues with your architecture.

1) In general, delegates should be weakly coupled. That means they should be reference types and weakly retained. Also, as a style issue, protocol names should be capitalized like class names.

    protocol ImagePassing: class {
    	func tappedImage(image: UIImage)
    }
    
    class ViewController: UIViewController {
    	weak var imagePassingDelegate: ImagePassing?
    }

2) The connections are never being set between your objects.

    let vc = ViewController()

Declaring your property like that on ImageViewController instantiates a whole new ViewController that is not the same as the ViewController instance presenting the ImageViewController. So when ImageViewController calls

    vc.imagePassingDelegate = self

That results in setting the delegate on that new object. Which isn't even on screen and is not handling the tap.

3) However, even if ImageViewController had a valid reference to ViewController, it wouldn't be set until after you tried to call 'tappedImage' in 'didSelectItemAt' because 'viewDidLoad()' is not guaranteed to have been called yet.",1531423492.0

zaksoup,"I think you might be asking the wrong question. Swift, Golang, Rust, etc, all are modern systems programming languages with similar characteristics. Learning one vs. the other won't be that different.

My question for you is 'what do you want to do with Swift once you learn to use it?' At the end of the day programming is far less about the languages you know as it is about what the right tool for the job you want to do is. Building a simple website that doesn't require user accounts or data storage? Sounds like you should learn JavaScript and HTML/CSS. Building a mobile app that needs persistent data storage and notifications support? Take a look at Swift with a Firebase back-end.

For now, though, you're going to benefit the most from studying the basics of \*software engineering\* in any language you choose. For mobile apps understanding the ""patterns"" that are used, like so-called Protocol Oriented Programming that's heavily used in iOS APIs, will help you much more than a deep knowledge of swift specifically. Golang, for instance, also heavily uses Protocol-based patterns (though in go they're called 'interfaces') and what you learn in Swift will be easily applicable and transferable there.

TL;DR: focus on learning programming patterns and designs in a language that's most applicable to the first thing you are interested in building, don't worry about what specific language is easiest.",1531441438.0
thisischemistry,"Swift is a decently simple language to learn, although there are a few tricky concepts that seem to trip people up.

The main one is the `Optional`. Suppose you want to measure a person's height, you'd do that and store it as a number. Let's say we're dealing with whole numbers so we use an `Int`, a type that represents whole numbers.

So if the person shows up that day we measure their height in whatever unit, say inches. We get 72 inches and store that in an `Int`:

    var height: Int
    height = 72

OK, so we used the word `var` to create storage named `height` which holds an `Int` and set that storage equal to 72.

But what if the person didn't show up that day? We need a number for their height but we don't have a number. If we use just any number then how will we know if it's a valid height or not?

What we do is make an `Optional` to hold the value, like putting it in a box. The box may be empty or it may hold the value. It looks like this:

    var height: Int?

The question mark changes the `Int` to an `Optional` `Int`.

Now, if the value is not valid then it will be equal to `nil`. That stands for nothing or invalid. We can check to see if it's equal to `nil` like this:

    if height == nil {
      print(""No height measured"")
    }
  
The `==` is the equality operator and it means ""is equal to"". If the statement between the `if` and the first curly bracket is true then everything between the two curly brackets happens.

If we want the actual value stored in `height` we have to ""unwrap"" it. That means we check to see if there's a value and then we take it out of the `Optional` ""box"". Here is an example of a method called ""optional binding"", it tests and unwraps the `Optional` in one step:

    if let unwrappedHeight = height {
      print(""The height is:"", unwrappedHeight)
    }

If `height` is an `Optional` with a valid value then it's unwrapped and `unwrappedHeight` gets set to that value, then everything in the curly brackets happens. If `height` is not set to a valid value then everything in the curly brackets is skipped.",1531413059.0

You could replicate this behaviour in Swift by definition custom subscript operators on `String`, but you'll run into the same pitfall. There's a reason it was purposely omitted in the Standard Library.

Besides, that's not how you would write that in Swift. Depending on whether you need to slice characters (most common in front end work), utf8 or utf16 code points (most common if you're doing low level storage management, or communications protocols like BLE, etc.), you would make an array using `let a = Array(s.characters)`, `let bytes = Array(s.utf8)`, etc. Then you would do all your slicing operations, which are now `O(1)` in the character case, because the character splitting has already been done once. Once your done all your slicing, you commit your changes by converting the array back into a string (`String(a)`).",1531405480.0

Slypenslyde,"I think it's really hard to predict exactly where the heck the industry will go.

Cross-platform web-based stuff like Cordova or Electron is popular because for a lot of jobs, you have to target EVERYTHING: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android. No one wants to maintain four different products. 

We got here because of a lot of things. 

15 years ago, the problem was easy: for the vast majority of people only Windows mattered. Businesses had Windows machines, and assumed they'd use Windows forever. 

10 years ago, it was only a little more complicated. The web was still glorified Form input, and you still mostly targeted Windows. iOS/Android were there and growing fast, but most people considered that a market for apps more like Yelp than the enterprisey stuff that makes up the majority of gigs. 

5 years ago shit had hit the fan. Suddenly Macs were as relevant as Windows. iOS/Android were getting as useful as laptops. Web frameworks were starting to do more impressive things.  MS was introducing and murdering frameworks annually. This is when ""We'll use Windows forever"" started to crumble.

So here we are. Will we use laptops in 5 years? Will they be Windows or MacOS? If we don't, will we be using tablets, or just AR headsets? Will they be iOS, Android, or something we haven't seen yet? It's very hard to tell. There are compelling arguments for and against each major platform, and large-scale projects betting on any or all of them. 

The one truth is that web apps work on all platforms consistently. So while we're in this weirdo transitional phase and no one knows what the heck is going to ""win"", they are a very safe approach. 

So you really just have to pick, and remain flexible. Don't lose your web chops. It's always going to be safe. Native dev is always going to be ""best"" in terms of user experience, but platforms can topple and leave you with irrelevant skills. 

THAT SAID, it's not as severe as it used to be. Had Windows collapsed in the mid-90s, all that WinAPI experience would've meant zilch when moving to a platform like Linux. But now there's a lot of sameness in dev. iOS and Android may have different APIs, but it's all similar concepts and they tend to converge on ideas and features. Android in particular ""looks like"" the recent MS frameworks from WPF to UWP thanks to C# and Java having very similar philosophies. In particular, WPF/UWP's use of XAML makes it ""feel like"" writing Node apps with HTML/JS. 

Swift's fate seems tied to how strongly you think Apple will achieve dominance in the market. I think Apple is serious about using it instead of Obj-C at some point. I don't think Apple is as serious or as poised to be ""everywhere"" like Android is. But you can also say Google and iOS target markets that don't necessarily overlap. So ""is either platform future-proof"" depends on ""what kind of gig you want"". I can see Android being ""the enterprise solution"" and iOS remaining ""the consumer preference"". I can see Windows declining, but I don't think I see MacOS ever occupying the market the way Windows did. And Linux isn't going to, either. I have a feeling the age of Desktop has passed. It'll never die, in the same way mainframes still exist. But I can totally buy that Surface is more like the future than anything else. 

So. Find a gig you like with a company you like and latch on. Keep reading blogs about the stuff you're not doing, though. Do little side projects, when you can, in tech you aren't using.

Slypenslyde,"Describe what you mean by ""difficulty spike"". 

It's easy to think there comes a point where you can think of an app and bang it out all in one sitting. *That never happens.* Here's a more realistic description:

Every programmer only knows how to do what they've already solved. That's why experts seem to make it easy. If we can imagine a ""simple"" iOS app as requiring you to solve 30 different problems, a person who has already solved about 26 of those is going to make it look easier than a person who's only solved 5.

""A problem"" can be as simple as ""how to make an outlet in Interface Builder"" or as hard as ""how to allow the user to take a picture"". Hard problems tend to involve coordinating the solutions to lots of easy problems. For example, that picture problem involves solving:

* What ViewController can I use to put the camera on the screen?
* How do I instantiate that?
* How do I present it?
* How do I get the picture the user took, or detect when they canceled?

This is kind of like how ""showing your work"" in math works. Long division always works. But many can do division like ""240 / 6"" without showing all the in-between steps. It's a lot faster to skip those steps, but it will confuse people who can't do the math in their head.

When you're following lessons/tutorials, you're watching someone teach you one way to solve a relatively complicated problem. They have to show you solutions to all the smaller problems that make up that bigger one. Sometimes experts forget some of the little problems along the way. So they take a shortcut and don't show their work. It's possible they've been an expert on that topic for so long they *forgot* they're taking a shortcut. 

Also, many lessons assume you've memorized previous lessons before continuing. Programming tends to assume this. The more little solutions you memorize, the more complex problems you can solve without getting too stumped. Maybe a previous lesson explained the place you're stuck. 

Or, maybe it's just a bad teacher.

What you should care about is ease-of-use, preventing crashes, and guarding against bad data access. For these things `Codable` does an admirable job.

ssrobbi,"Issues with this benchmark

* I don't understand this comparison, Codable is just a protocol. It's the JSONEncoder/Decoder that can be benchmarked. He kind of mentions this but not very clearly. You could potentially write your own JSON Encoder/Decoder using Codable that would be faster.
* SwiftProtobuf isn't even JSON, which he says in the article, but doesn't fit in a benchmark between JSON parsers
* ObjectMapper and PMJSON benchmarked starting with a JSON string, not Data
* ObjectMapper encodes to a String, and PMJSON encodes to its enum, not Data
* The encoding for Marshal is doing the conversion from an object to a dictionary before the evaluation starts, so it's really only testing NSJsonSerialization's performance
* The Codable test instantiates a new DateFormatter every test where as the Mapper and PMJSON implementation instantiates one once (date formatters take a long time to instantiate)
* Marshal doesn't really do too much. It's a small framework that requires your objects have initializers that pull values from a dictionary generated from NSJsonSerialization
* While there's nothing really wrong with testing on a Mac, most people intend to use these frameworks for iOS apps so benchmarking on an iPhone may have been useful to see. Not to mention if this is intended to run on an iOS app, the differences in son parsing speed for any of these is negligible. Even for a server in many cases this wouldn't matter.

    static func getMissionData(postFixURL: String, then completion: @escaping (Mission?) -> Void) {
        
        let apiUrl = URL(string: ""https://api.X.com/\(postFixURL))"")
        
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: apiUrl!) { (data, response, error) in
            
            guard let data = data else {
                // No data, callback with nil
                completion(nil)
                return
            }
            
            do {
                let mission = try JSONDecoder().decode(Mission.self, from: data)
                
                // Success!
                completion(mission)

                print(err.localizedDescription)

            }
            
            }.resume()
    }

Then your call site looks like this: 

    Mission.getMissionData(postFixURL: ""some/url/path"") { mission in
        if let mission = mission {
            // Update UI

 - Codable doesn't support polymorphic types. That is, if I have a `[Foo]` array but really contains subclasses of `Foo`, I can't easily archive it using `Codable` and need to go back to manually archive the array via `NSCoding`.

The more important thing is: Never duplicate things ""for safety purposes"" because you don't trust some part of your app, you'll suffer for it. Your example shows why well: If I had to work with your project, I'd find the hidden property both in the storyboard and in code. But if the view is hidden in both the storyboard and in code, I'd probably try to change the property in the storyboard, and it just wouldn't work. That would cause quite a WTF moment. (The same WTF moment would happen to you, too, after a month or so).

If you don't trust one of the components to do the right thing (in this case, loading the hidden property from the storyboard), write a unit test to verify that it works.

GHansard,"You've found one of the problems with JSON.  Parsing JSON is *expensive* compared to other formats.  Large JSON is particularly troublesome.  Many opt to store multiple JSON objects in a file or stream, keeping each object to a single line and using newline separators to distinguish between each object.  Then the cost of serialization of the entire data set might be deferred or parallelized.

That said, JSON is likely the wrong storage format for this use case.  If you need speed, you likely want a binary storage format.  Ideally, you'd want one that lets you readily perform searching and various kinds of matching.  At least, those sounds like common use cases.  I'd recommend SQLite.  It's a compact binary format that performs admirably in scenarios like this.  There's a learning curve to using it, but it's not bad and learning SQL is a wonderful tool to put in the toolbox.

For your use case, you may consider parsing your current JSON file and storing the data into a SQLite database that you then ship with the application.

OVS,"Can't find other types of questions right now, but I can give you some answers you may expect.  
1) The price should be a certain amount of $/day/developper  
So if they need 20 days, and they have 4 devs, they will split those 20 days between them, for exemple 5 days/dev. And if they all cost the same price, for exemple 250 - 300$ a day, you could expect to pay 20\*250 or 20\*300.   
2) It depends on the reason of those update. It could be bug fixing, new features or anything that need to change the code.  
3) for bug fixing, this should be free, because you paid for a working app, so it MUST work without bug.  
You can chose something called TMA (There Maintenance Application, which is more or less a number of day you ask them to work on your app, often per month. So if you need to add new features, they will work during those days. You have to chose wisely, because if you chose to many days, you will pay for nothing, because they will be paid even if they have nothing to do, or if you chose not enough, they won't be able to finish what you ask for, and will have to pay additional days, or delay the work for the next month, so delays the update of your app.  
4) you can use an app like Adobe XD (which is kind of free), and ""draw"" all the screens you imagine for your app. So the only work they will have would be to code the app to obtain the exact same screens you send them. But, of course, they can, and should, help you with design, because their are A LOT of rules to follow to create a great app.

KarlJay001,"I see you're thinking about doing this yourself.  This is basically an issue of how complex the app really is.  From an economic standpoint, you're looking at paying a pro because they have skills now that are far above yours (or at least that's the assumption).  It's like paying someone to work on your car vs you doing it yourself.

If the work is to change a flat tire, you might be best off doing that yourself, if it's to replace the head gasket, you might be best off to pay someone.

There's a risk in hiring someone in that you might not know just how skilled they are.

A college student posted he would do a fix bid app to help pay for college.  I gave him the specs for a ""picture browser"" app that was part of a popular, entry tutorial and asked him for a price.

My in box got flooded with replies ranging from a few hundred to nearly $80,000.00 USD.  He started digging into layout, design, etc...  I said, simple picture browser.  He never came back with a price, others did and they were all over the map.

There's a LOT of money to be made and a LOT of scammers out there.  You might pay $30K, just to find out you got a re-skinned template app.

Ask yourself how complex is the app, look at the work that the devs have done.  Most will have ""template"" or ""tutorial"" apps.  These are all over the place and some can be bought for $9.99 to a few hundred.

It's all perfectly legal as long as it works and they didn't break any lic agreement.

The gain to you is supposed to be that they have great skills and can provide whatever you need.  Someone peddling re-skins isn't likely to be able to serve all your needs, but might offer a cheap price at the start.

Maybe you just need an advisor to help you put it together yourself.

Good development teams/individuals will have built many apps and have a lot of experience. They should be pushing back against your ideas to suss out the best solutions. Some development teams have inside design resources, some have inside user experience people. So if you can't do the design yourself, you can either higher a designer separately or you can contract with a shop that can do both. (Many designers know developers and vice versa).

You should see yourself as the conductor of an orchestra. Find great people and let them do what they do best. You are just helping organize and provide the overall direction.

First *\[Int\]()* which basically says, create and initialize an array of ints. It calls the init() function of that type.  
And the second part, *1...4* which contains the triple-dot operator, which creates a sequence (or rather it creates *a CountableClosedRange<Int>*). This also works:

    print(1...4)

or

    for i in (1...4) {
        print(i)

thisischemistry,"The major differences between the two languages are these:

- Onjective-C has header files to separate interface from implementation, Swift does not
- Objective-C heavily uses pointers to objects, Swift uses references or directly uses values
- Objective-C has method swizzling - the ability to dynamically replace a method with another one, Swift does not
- Objective-C allows messages to be sent to null pointers (they will have no results), Swift does not
- Nearly all Objective-C objects inherit from NSObject, most Swift objects do not
- Swift has type inference, Objective-C does not

Other than that the rest is mostly syntax. For example, calling a method in Objective-C will look like:

    [foo someMethod]

In Swift this will look like:

    foo.someMethod()

Objective-C objects have an allocation method and an initialization method:

    [[Bar alloc] init]

Sometimes they are combined in a `new` method:

    [Bar new]

In Swift they are combined into an `init` method:

    Bar.init()

Which has a shortcut to call it:

    Bar()

Basically, Objective-C is still very very close to its C roots. Pretty much everything is a pointer of some kind so you should check to see if it's nil before using it to avoid bugs. Obviously, in Swift nearly everything is either an a valid object or an `Optional` so you should unwrap it safely.",1530728130.0

Things to consider to break out of that mindset:

- Objective-C is the language of Cocoa and all the Apple frameworks 
- There is a lot of Objective-C code out there...
- ...including Objective-C example code (which will not break every year as the language is stable/not being developed much)
- You'll be acquiring the skillset that will make you a lot more valuable to a lot more clients

As for learning Objective-C, try and get the official Apple docs on it. They probably have them buried away somewhere on developer.apple.com as they want everyone to learn Swift now. There were actually some really great docs about Cocoa which seem to have been pulled or deprecated from the developer site.

I’m still a big noob, but what has worked the best for me is to diversify . In other words, don’t just stick with one app, book or video series. Diversify! Did optionals give you a hard time the first time you read about it? Given another context you’ll suddenly have that «aha!» moment before you know it. 

With that out of the way, I’ve had experience with the following apps: 

**Code Swift:** It’s one of the more updated apps compared to a lot of outdated apps on the App store. There are numerous topics to dive into, but the tasks are pretty much the same — guess what’s missing and write it. 

**SoloLearn:** I like this app. It has a really cool approach, and I really like the social element. If you’re stuck on a quiz you can use the comments section for help. It has one major drawback, though. The courses haven’t been updated to use the latest version of Swift. Another nitpick I have, is that you can’t use the coding section for Swift yet. 

**TapCoding:** I’ve only used the free courses, which were very basic but decent enough. The app itself seems abandoned which put me off from purchasing the other courses. 

**Mimo:** I really like the courses and the style. It requires a subscription to unlock all the courses. The pricing would probably scare away most people. I decided to take the plunge, but only because I was interested in the other coding courses as well. The first three courses or so are free.

rezarekta,"What you seem to be asking is if the more subviews you have, the slower it will get to ""live-resize and draw them"". 

The answer is most likely yes... but there are way too many variables to give a useful answer... Depending on how exactly you plan on doing your zoom. Are you drawing these views and positioning them manually? Are you using Auto-Layout? do you plan on using transforms to do it? (CGAffineTransformMakeScale? CGContextScaleCTM?). 

Time complexity is used to describe the worst case scenario in terms of elementary operations for an algorithm as the input grows (e.g.  I am searching for a value in an unsorted array of *n* element, the worst case that could happen is that I have to go through all the elements (i.e. *n*), therefore the time complexity is O(n) ). 

There's absolutely no need to get down to big O notation and time complexity in this case, really what you're interested in, is if having a lot of subviews is going to be slow to zoom, and the answer depends entirely on how you implement that zoom. You could just render an image of the view as soon as zoom is initiated, and zoom on that image, and then redraw the actual view (and its subviews) once the zooming is done, and then it doesn't matter how many subviews you have. Or possibly just zoom the context, and then do the actual view drawing later. Or you can just use transforms, and then it will definitely matter how many subviews you have. If you use autolayout, chances are that doing transforms on a lot of views is going to be slow, or if you calculate everything manually and position your views manually without autolayout, you might be able to pull it off depending on how many views there are...

However, if you go to read posts and have to gather them all up the user will suffer as they wait for the data.

Updating posts in real-time is less of a concern than responsiveness in reading them. Most times people won't notice if there is a few seconds difference between when someone else makes a post and when it shows up in their feed. In fact, it's not that surprising of a behavior. But when you go to check for posts and the app spins as it waits for data? That's very annoying to a user.

,"I think you can do a mixture of both. Fan out signals that a new user posted. The client can then fetch upon needed. The idea I have was inspired by how I believe Snapchat works at a high level.

If the app is open, keep a socket open to your server so that it can listen to new snap signals. Notice I say signals and not objects? 

If the app is open the signal tells the client to fetch new data. Notice how you’re not sending all of the posts you’re just sending a signal that new data is available. 

When the app goes to the background you can close this socket and let the system’s push notification take over “John sent you a snap” then when you open the app it knows to fetch data. 

This is just a high level concept and maybe it could work or not but I’m opposed to copying a million tweets when you could just push signals to the client with an SDK like Pusher. ",1530672050.0

divinedominion,"> it runs NOT in the main thread (I guess).

You guess? :) Doesn't sound like a good idea if you're not certain. I suggest to leave the main context on the main queue, and create child contexts for actions that take longer which then merge into the main context. Nowadays you get a lot of convenient methods to achieve this.

You can set up your context's dispatch queue during initialization. The key is to use the `perform` methods on your context to make sure requests are executed in the context's queue.

See here to get an idea: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24751276/nsmanagedobjectcontext-and-queues#24751575

To see if the target queue is the problem, try `performAndWait` to wait for the fetch to finish: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobjectcontext/1506364-performandwait

If that doesn't do the trick, try to execute the functionality on the main queue. Try to get remove concurrency out of the part you need to debug for now to figure out where the problem comes from.

GartNJ,"I agree with some of the other folks here, saying that a formal education in Computer Science is not required to be hired as a professional iOS developer. Proving you can perform under deadlines and your knowledge of the material is much more valuable.

I'm the proof. I studied an online Objective-C course online for 3 months, worked my butt off studying inside and outside of the course, learning and building apps that used different frameworks and APIs. I got my first contract job roughly 6 months after I started learning, but that was definitely because I undercut everyone else they interviewed saying I'd work for essentially half of what they would normally pay someone, and showing them my willingness to learn new technologies. I did this because I really needed experience to ""get my foot in the door"" of the industry.

If you're trying to do this nowadays, there are a ridiculous amount of online resources to learn swift from Apple and from 3rd parties. Check out iBooks (or Books, of you're running iOS 12) for ""Intro to App Development with Swift""(I think 100-200 pages) and ""App Development with Swift"" (roughly 900 pages).

However, the biggest issue is not learning the material, it's making it a priority to learn. I truly think everyone could learn to program and code if they wanted to do it. But, forcing yourself to skip that weekend party, that soccer game with your friends, that movie with your wife, etc... whatever is going on, so you can sit down and really dig into the material will be a difficult obstacle to overcome. If you're trying to get into the industry in 6 months, you'll need to sacrifice time and effort to do so. I thought about quitting 3-4 times while I was learning because it's hard to struggle with code bugs while you see everyone out enjoying life. But, it's so worth it in the end.

Feel free to PM me if you have any questions while you're learning. I hope that helps and Good Luck!",1530553213.0
frankacy,"""Professional"" is a word that evokes many different things for many different people.

If your goal is to focus on online courses and find \*any\* junior iOS job by the end of the year, I feel like it'll be difficult, but it's certainly possible. However, your network is going to be as much of a factor in your success as your technical knowledge. Do you have friends in the industry? If not, get out there and meet people. Conferences, meet ups, hack nights and hackathons. Whatever opportunities you can find to meet people and connect, take them and follow up. These people will become your allies when you're looking to break into the industry.

If your goal is to get a great iOS job at an intermediate or senior level, then that's simply not going to happen. These types of positions require a nuanced understanding of object-oriented concepts and their tradeoffs. The type of stuff that only comes with experience. If you work hard though, you can definitely get to this position quickly.

Either way, you'll realize that specific iOS technical knowledge is the \*least\* of your concerns when looking for an iOS job. That stuff is easy to learn and there are plenty of great resources available for different price points. It's everything else that's difficult :)",1530558192.0

Go to some of the sites that show interview questions, look at the apps they want you to develop just to get past the 1st level interview.

thisischemistry,"By the end of this year? It's a very long shot and not realistic at all. Yes, you may be able to create your own apps and perhaps you can create some minor apps for small companies that aren't looking for a professional developer. However, a truly professional company is going to want someone with serious education and years of experience as a programmer.

I would look at courses at a local university, as well as doing some self-education online. Get at least a minor background in computer science from somewhere accredited. Try to go for at least an associates degree, if possible. However, most professional organizations really want a bachelor's degree to look at you seriously.

With some serious self-taught knowledge, good code samples, and few courses under your belt you may be able to get an internship/junior developer position. It'll still be a tough road to get anything truly professional with those bare-bones but you might be able to get your foot in the door.

In all likelihood you are looking at several years worth of learning and job-searching before you can be a professional programmer.

i went from admin jobs to having a full time ios dev  job in about six months. so depending on how aggressive you are about this goal it could happen. 

if you have in-person boot camps for programming, i would do one of those.  if not, i would see what boot camps offer online courses. if you do it part time, you will probably not meet the goal. 

But even with part time course work you can make it happen in maybe a year. Then do an internship or apprenticeship program for a few months. it’s easier to score one of those. make sure you have a strong portfolio of complex, original project apps. not just tutorial remakes or assignments. 

while i would never discourage someone from a goal or career path, i have to add that i know in the US the ios job market is much smaller than web. it might be a good idea to think about why you want to do ios specifically. it will lessen your opportunities and the learning curve is much wider.

divinedominion,"**Professionality** is a pretty hard thing to attain. It's more about the attitude, thogh. A lot of top programmers have a sloppy attitude, cannot take responsibility, expose insurmountable hubris, or think they know it all and won't listen and learn. To get the right mindset, check out Robert Martin: _The Clean Coder_.

Here's what I learned teaching other people to program (in Swift). If you have an affinity to solve technical problems, go with online courses and lots of deliberate practice to get you started:

- Get a practice book like ""Learn Ruby the Hard Way"" to learn a language; you can switch to Swift easily once you understand the basics of programming and are fluent in any other language. (The Swift docs and API documentation aren't very beginner friendly. Some Swift conventions are simply puzzling. I tried to teach a client the basics of UI programming, and looking up `NSRect` in the documentation is one of the harder things to do: first, the documentation doesn't open the correct page most of the time, so you have to click twice, then `NSRect` is defined as a typealias for `CGRect` which isn't helping at all, then you have to look up `CGRect`'s methods and make sense of ""what is Core Graphics after all?""; meh. And code completion in Xcode only work 80% of the time, often not for initializers, which you want to use a lot. And there's no docs for keywords like switch/if/func/class/...)
- Or get a live coach, which is arguably a lot more expensive.
- Try to find someone to practice with and talk to. Figuring out things on your own can work, but having a 2nd opinion and point of view is always better. (And you can pair program, which is cool!)
- Separate your schedule:
    - reade code of other people and annotate it (treat it like reading and understanding a text in a foreign language), 
    - take not of every question that comes to mind so you can solve it later, like ""how do nested loops work"", or ""can I override stored properties with computed properties in subclasses?"" or similar stuff,
    - schedule a lot of time for practice to solve problems,
    - schedule some time, 10mins or so, at the beginning of longer learning sessions to get to know the tools. Perform a couple of tasks in Xcode, like create a new throwaway project for the day and commit changes with git from within Xcode so that these things become 2nd nature. You can do [a coding kata](http://codekata.com/) every time during that time, too.

Once you master the language and your practice goes beyond ""create an object that implements CustomStringConvertible to expose the sum of its property values"" or similar, look for inspiration for mini projects that can take a couple of days to complete, for example: https://github.com/soapyigu/Swift-30-Projects

ADadFather,"Because you're not using the counter in the for loop for anything; the first change I would suggest is that you use the \`for...in\` construction. This will loop through every item in the list.

Let swift figure out that your array has sub arrays. It should be able to do that on its own.

    for aPoint in dataPoints {
    print(""\(aPoint[0]) second point \(aPoint[1])"")
    }

Then I could use that fact to check the two parts for whether or not they are finite

    for aPoint in dataPoints {
        let doubleX = Double(aPoint[0])
        let doubleY = Double(aPoint[1])
        if doubleX.isFinite && doubleY.isFinite {
            print(""Both values were finite"")
        }
    }

Where I have my print statement, you would do your creation of the dataEntry variable and add it to your array.

A second way to do this would be to use the \`map\` and \`filter\` methods of any array. So, first you would filter the old array into a new array that contains only those values that are finite. Then you filter that new array into an array that contains only ChartDataEntry objects.

    let filteredArray = dataPoints.filter { (aPoint) -> Bool in
        let doubleX = Double(aPoint[0])
        let doubleY = Double(aPoint[1])
        if doubleX.isFinite && doubleY.isFinite {
            return true
        }
        return false
    }
    
    let dataEntryArray = filteredArray.map { (finitePoint) -> ChartDataEntry in
        let doubleX = Double(finitePoint[0])
        let doubleY = Double(finitePoint[1])
        return ChartDataEntry(x: doubleX, y: doubleY)
    }
    
    dataEntries.append(dataEntryArray)

The first part (the filter) will add any dataPoint to the ""filteredArray"" if the block returns ""true"". The second part (the map) will go through the array and for each object in the array it will convert it to a ChartDataEntry object and then stick that in the new array.

Hope this helps.

Aeather,Why are you calling reloadData twice? Once in view will appear and once in your loadData?,1530361390.0
ADadFather,"Every time your viewWillAppear is called it will load the data from the JSON and then add it to whatever it has. If you look over in the AppDelegate (usually it's at the bottom if you're using the supplied templates) there will be a contextSave() or something similar. That is saving the Core Data items to the disk. Now, the next time your view appears it will download a new set of data and then add it to whatever is in core data. This line of code will get called every time the view appears and it downloads the items and adds them to the Core Data storage

    Networking.performSelector(inBackground: #selector(Networking.fetchCommits), with: nil)

and because it's on a background queue it will take some unknown amount of time to occur. That means it doesn't wait for this to be done before your call to \`loadData()\` happens. So, over time, you are going to get more and more items on the list.

Depending on what your data looks like, you can either add a little fetch request to your \`fetchCommits\` and try to distinguish new items from ones that are already in the data store. So, if  your ""name"" or ""symbol"" property isn't going to change, you can see if a record already exists with that property and if it does don't add the new one.

Or, you can have the very first thing that your \`fetchCommits\` function does is to erase all of the data before it adds new data. I don't know anything about your data, but this way is not generally a good way because it will quickly cause performance issues. But, if you do want to go this way, be sure that you call a contextSave() after you do the delete. After doing an insert or a delete, you often need to call contextSave() because of the way that CoreData holds onto the data.

However, if you're planning to load the data from the JSON on every time you get a viewWillAppear (or even if you just put it in viewDidLoad) then I don't think that you want to be using Core Data. Core Data is designed to hold data on disk and let you use it there. You're grabbing it from the network each time, so, just stick it into some array.",1530386646.0

joanniso,"Hate to break it to you, but this is full of misunderstandings. This is fine and can be learned from.

You will not run out of array indexes, not even close. Let’s say you store only odd numbers in an array. You’ll have 1 index every entry. And one entry every time you go up 2 numbers. To get to one million you need half a million indexes. You’ll  run out of the integer limit for your value twice faster than the index.

Secondly, Int in swift is the largest integer supported by your computer. This is almost always 64 bits. 32 bits computers go up to roughly 2 billion positive and negative. 64 bits numbers go a looooot longer than that, a trillion is a small number for an Int64 (or just Int), being just above the barrier for Int32. An Int33, for reference, would be 2 to the power of 33 compared to 2 to the power of 32. Integer capacities grow exponentially, and 2 to the power of 64 is far above a trillion.

The reason your compilation hangs on such a large array is simply the compiler’s capabilities and optimizations. An array defined using a literal, in code itself, needs to be parsed by the compiler. This means going over the text, checking absolute correctness and keeping all values in the back of it’s mind. Once it has remembered and analyzed this huge source file it needs to do optimizations where possible and then store it in a binary. The memory needed for your raw array is 8 bytes per element, for almost 800’000 elements. Meaning in the most optimal perfect scenario it would need about 8MB. But a compiler isn’t made for this, so this would be far from optimal. Compiling takes ages like this, which you noticed. This results in the compiler shutting down because it exceeds the compiler’s time limit. A compiler has a time limit to prevent itself from getting stuck infinitely.

Next, if you didn’t figure this already, your TXT file contains textual integers. This is very slow to run for computers compared to natural binary integers. It needs to interpret and convert the text to binary first. Your code is also splitting a string into individual pieces of text for each integer by removing the line terminator. Again a very heavy operation. On smaller datasets not a problem, but once you expand to millions of prime numbers an enormous performance problem.

There are two ways to improve this part. The first is so loop over the characters one at a time until you see the newline. Then converting these letters to an integer and going forward. This reduced memory usage by a tonne, saving a lot of performance in the process. Another option is to go a bit further and saving all your prime numbers in binary. Then casting your data to the Int type. This will immediately convert the binary dataset to the prime numbers as Int without any performance overhead other than loading the file to Data but requires making a new file other than the TXT. It’ll be faster and use less code wt the same time",1530352692.0

rennarda,"First point - why is this in r/swift ? - it's a Cocoa programming issue, not pure Swift.

Ok there's some really bad advice and misinformation in this thread!

I don't disagree with the sentiment that you need to be able to make views in code *if necessary.* You should understand at a fundamental level what is happening when you create a view, add it to a hierarchy, set up constraints, etc, etc. Writing the code helps with that understanding. But you absolutely **should not** be hand coding all your views!

If you are building anything more than a trivial view you are going to have to work from a visual design - you just can't do this kind of layout in your head. Storyboards offer you a visual way do build the visual aspect of your app. I think those people who argue for code-only layout are either only working with extremely trivial views, have oodles of man hours to invest in hand coding, or are relying on high fidelity UI mockups from the design team, with all the constraints already specified. 

Storyboards have some well publicised shortcomings (mainly complexity when working in a large team, and string identifiers can mean a typo stops your view from working). But laying out complex view hierarchies that change and adapt to multiple device sizes is absolutely faster and more efficiently done in a storyboard. 

I think a lot of people never really get to grips with Storyboards and really understand how to use them. People seem to think they are only a design time tool, and that the output is compiled at build time. They aren't - the storyboard is archived and the components in that archive are the same objects that are instantiated at runtime. 

A lot of apps don't do basic things like state restoration which is almost trivial if done with a storyboard. Many apps don't change their layout for different size classes, again something that storyboards make possible. 

Storyboards also provide a kind of overview diagram for your app flow. When you're trying to debug an app and trying to work out what a particular view is, and how you get to it in the app, it's much easier if you can visually see the flow in a storyboard.

Largely I recommend sticking closely to the first party tools and techniques recommended by Apple, and that is and remains MVC using storyboards. Only break from this if you have a good reason because it isn't serving you correctly in your particular circumstances.

In fact I expect people to know how to use NSURLSession, auto layout and proper use of constraints, storyboards, and general UIView/NSView hierarchies **without needing third party libraries**, and being able to explain each during interviews.

2. `func magicEightBall(value: Int)` only takes values of Int type. Your `randomNum` constant is actually of type UInt32. Why, though? The `arc4random_uniform` function actually returns a value of UInt32. Here's the full declaration: `func arc4random_uniform(_ __upper_bound: UInt32) -> UInt32`

To remedy issue #2, you can convert `randomNum`'s UInt32 type to Int type with the declaration of a new constant underneath your first constant:

You could use prepare for segue to either pass this data directly to the new view or to store it on the phone itself.   Then, as you update scores, the array gets updated, keeping track of both team and player scores.

Sounds like it shouldn’t be too difficult!

rfpels,"The whole point of optionals is that in Swift a variable must have a value - unless you declare it as being optional. This means that the value of a variable can be unknown. Or absent. 

This makes truth maintenance much much easier. Any variable of non-optional type has a value. Period. No more checking if a variable is nil. The language **GUARANTEES** that variables that are not optional always have a value.

Vice versa the Swift language has optionals built into the language which means that there are also constructs to deal with optionals in a concise way with `if let` and `guard` and optional binding. This creates a meaningful way to handle truth maintenance and gives you the means to deal with unknown or absent values within an expression. 

Compared to the `Optional` class in Java for example this is a huge step forward.

beornsos,"So good, thank you! My questions were more around how to use ""guard,"" but i also learned several other things. i've seen things like instance?.method() but never quite knew exactly what that meant, though I had my suspicions.  The bit about Optional being an enum was also really interesting and made sense.  for some reason when doing an if-let statement i'll slightly rename the optional variable... so ex:

    if let tempVar = var {
        print(tempVar)
    }

but i didn't know you could just use the same variable name. well i think i already knew that, but when i was first starting to learn that just confused me so i started using the tempVar standard. i will start writing my code a bit differently!

I stumbled into this mostly by accident. I was looking for a nice audiobook player, BookPlayer worked well but was missing a nice UI (Which I just realized isn’t shown in the screenshots on GitHub yet, hence the gallery). So I took the chance to create something new and the original creator was nice enough to allow me to dig in and turn over many things along the way

I haven’t developed for iOS in years, left off before Swift became a thing. Moving from Objective-C to Swift was as much an adventure as the whole project for me. I did a lot of JavaScript in the mean time so that switch still gives me headaches, but I learned to like Swift. But I also feel like I still have a lot of things to learn here and that is why I’m writing this. 

Any feedback is welcome, especially on things like ContainerViews and how messages and closures are passed through the app. Gianni (the original creator) did an amazing job at keeping my weirder loan ideas from JS at bay, but I want to learn more. That is, if anyone wants to give it a look, I know that sifting through larger projects is a lot to ask for.

Otherwise if you’re creating the new view controller programaticqlly, just assign the values where you create the view controller.

If you’re having trouble with the value being inconsistent between screens, it’s probably because you’re passing a string id by value rather than by reference.

Also if you’re truly aiming to store data permanently, you’ll want to be using UserDefaults",1529867841.0
__Diesel__,"It sounds like you have two different questions. 1 is how do I store it, the other is how do I access it from different classes once I have it.

To store the username I use UserDefaults.standard. Below is a piece of code for my login function where it uses an optional username or looks into the database. If it can't get a username from either, it returns.

    func logIn(_ username: String? = nil, _ password: String? = nil, completionHandler: @escaping (_ worked: Bool, _ error: String?) -> Void){
        guard let user = username ?? UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: ""username"") else{
            return completionHandler(false, ""No username found"")
        }
    ...

I maintain my user session by having a user class which is a singleton, which is a bit of a touchy subject. My current session is maintained in this class with any other user data. I supposed you could just use UserDefaults to do it as well, that's up to you. Singletons should be used for specific reasons and not be over used.

If I can pass a variable between view controllers (which you may be able to do from the description) and avoid a singleton, I'll do that. Usually in the `func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?)` is where I'll pass variables. Something that persists across my entire app will often be a singleton for me.",1529868372.0

It’s my understanding that whenever you override a method on a UIKit class the first thing you should do is call super otherwise you risk the override not getting called but perhaps someone else could shed some light on that.

KarlJay001,"The demand for Swift is growing and isn't likely to slow any time soon.  The best way to understand the job market is to search the job boards. 

One job board is Dice.  Right now they are asking for 3\~5 or 5\~7 years experience with a degree and several complex apps published for Silicon Valley.  Silicon Valley doesn't have much to offer entry level mobile devs.

You can also look outside tech hubs, you see not many jobs even offered.  Even in California, Silicon Valley has thousands of openings and San Diego had 3 last time I checked.  Outside a tech hub, the demand for Swift falls like a rock.

IMO, mobile has a few important categories, games, utility, social, business, enterprise. Games has the subs of 3D, AR, MMOOG, etc...  Business and enterprise are two overlooked, fast growing areas.  These areas are all about moving older client server functions to mobile devices.

This is where iOS dev will spread out past tech hubs.  It's where a company will start to see the need to hire full time, in house, iOS devs for their in house enterprise software.

If iOS get a stronghold in mobile enterprise, meaning that businesses choose iOS over Android, more companies will be hiring more iOS/Swift devs.  Apple does have a big advantage here in that almost all the malware is on Android and Apple is the secure platform.  Businesses can't function well with all that malware, and I'm not sure how someone can secure an Android phone.  Maybe Blackberry has a solution there.

Before you read the below, please note that I am being highly critical for your benefit. I wouldn't say all of the below to my boss (the one who makes the hiring decision.)

General problems:
The code in GitHub doesn't compile. It looks like you used some cocoapods but you didn't include the podfile in your repo. As such, the code doesn't compile out of the box. That's a huge red flag for me.

Most of your variable names and the functions you named start with an upper-case letter. You aren't putting a space character after your colons. The standard Swift convention is for variables to start with a lower case letter and for there to be a space after every colon. This tells me that you aren't interested/knowledgable in standard Swift conventions. Another huge red flag.

You seem very stingy in the use of whitespace in general. 

There are multiple files where you left the templated bits that Xcode adds on file creation in the files. This shows to me a lack of attention to detail.

Regarding PurpView.swift:

Your Price1, 2, 3, & 4 variables screams for the use of an array but you didn't use one. You didn't remove the templated code that Xcode puts in on file creation.

Regarding MapViewController.swift:

You have wrapped some of your views in a PurpView, but then reach into PurpView and directly manipulate its internals; that's and example of ""messy code"". Read up on the Law of Demeter.

Unlike in other parts of your app, you *are* putting whitespace around the equals signs. This inconsistency is troubling. 

Regarding AppDelegate.swift

Did you commit actual API keys into GitHub? Into a public repo at that? 

Regarding ViewController.swift

Use of an NSMutableArray is a rather odd choice. I expect a Swift array instead. Your `ViewController` class implements several protocols, but you don't have them sectioned off in any consistent way. Unlike the files above, this one has lots of comments, but none of them are useful and all of them are quite redundant.

Your `tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath)` function spends 25 lines setting up a cell. The cell should know how to set itself up. This is a very leaky abstraction.

Regarding LocationManager.swift

Very inconsistent indentation.

Regarding BurritoTableViewCell.swift

This looks very much like the PurpView class. Lot's of redundancy here. That would be one thing if you were using storyboard/nib files, but not in the context of a no-storyboard system.

Regarding NoStoryBoardTests.swift

There are no tests at all.

cyrand,"So when I’m the lead on positions and reviewing sample projects like this there’s definitely some basic requirements:

As others have said, make sure everything is spelled properly and follows whatever the “popular” style guide is for the language you’re working at.
You **can** deviate from the style guidelines or do inventive solutions to things, but clearly explain in comments why you deviated.  So I can see the thought process behind it.
Do **not** have *any* warnings left in the code.  Any code projects like this I’ve ever done myself, or given to others, were all too small to justify any warnings not being corrected before being sent over.
Turn on **all** warnings that your development environment supports. 
Install and use a linter like swiftlint, follow its recommendations unless instructed otherwise by a provided style guide from the employer.
Do double check every line, remove extraneous unused code.
If sending a entire git repo with history, clean that history up (or better keep it clean through multiple commits **with** well described commit messages)

And in general recognize that you got very far in the process if you got to a sample project point, good job!  Refine your technique based on the feedback and good luck on your next try!  Recognize as well that **your** sample project may not be the only reason behind their decisions, because there are very likely a lot of people involved including other people who may have been interviewing.

sobri909,"Definitely messy. 

- Indentation is inconsistent. There's no consistent pattern, and code blocks aren't indented logically or consistently. Use four spaces (or a tab, if that's your thing) for indents, and use consistent rules about indentation of code blocks. 

- Inconsistent newlines. Stick to a set of whitespace rules and apply them everywhere. For me that means one blank line between methods, one blank line between logical blocks within methods, and one blank line above comments.

- Inconsistent spacing around keywords. You've got = with no spaces around it, which is not a common or favoured style, but you've also got = with spaces around it. You also have inconsistent spacing around : characters. Pick one style, and stick with it. (Ideally pick the most common style for the language you're using). 

- Inconsistent variable naming. Swift has naming conventions for use of camelCase. Learn them and stick with them. 

So yeah, even before getting to looking at the functionality and architecture of the code, it's already presenting itself as sloppy.

As a programmer you're essentially a tradesman, hammering digital nails into digital wood. You want your tradesmen to do a tidy job, get their lines straight, and clean up after themselves. Your lines aren't straight, there's no consistency to the style, and you've left cruft around the place after finishing the job.

Grab a ruler and a broom, make sure your lines are straight and consistent, and sweep up after yourself once the job is done. You've got to be a tidy tradesman before you can become a master craftsman. ",1529640229.0
thisischemistry,"I edited one file to show you how you can be more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - it's a principle that if you find yourself doing things multiple times you should probably abstract it out into a function call.

In this example you are creating multiple views with all the same settings, I combined them into one function that I called multiple times. I also stored all the views in one `Dictionary` and added them to the parent view in a functional manner.

Take a look:

princekolt,"After briefly browsing your code, the first impression when I open some of your files is that of a ""wall of text"", and also inconsistent indentation.

On top of that, your code feels like procedural code (read: ""C"" code) wrapped into classes, which is not a particularly good way of writing object-oriented code. Ideally you want to spread logic between classes to ensure task delegation is clear.

So, as a quick example, instead of writing something to the effect of:

    doSomethingTo(A)
    doSomethingTo(B)
    doSomethingTo(C)

You shroud strive to organize your code so that you can do stuff like:
    
    for thing in [A, B, C]
    {
        thing.doSomething()
    }

These could turn out to be logically identical, but the first is not the ideal style of object-oriented code, because if you decided to change what `doSomething` means for `B` only, then you change the source of `B`, not of `doSomethingTo` (which would require internal `if` statements).",1529623420.0

zweigraf,"Two more things from my side. I did not see them mentioned here, but feel free to ignore if they have already been mentioned.

1.	When not using Storyboards/Xib flies, you can do so much more in the init() of a viewController, which saves you from using implicitly unwrapped optionals. So e.g. in MapViewController, you can just pass the selected restaurant into the init, and you can then store that as a let. One source of bugs fixed. This is important, as when you only init your optionals in viewDidLoad, there are a lot of opportunities for people to call into your view controller’s code which could mean you access the optionals before viewDidLoad actually happened, leading to a crash.

2.	There is a definite bug in your table view cell handling. You do not implement prepareForReuse in your Burrito cell to reset the views’ properties. When you reuse a cell, and then only set isHidden = true for price level 4, the other ones could still be hidden even though you do not want that. They are not automatically reset when reusing, you have do to that manually. You should have isHidden = false for every price level in the cell’s prepareForReuse method.",1529663580.0

omparay,"After reading a few of your files I have doubts that it was messy. To me, messy means code is not straightforwardly readable because code is in multiple subclasses and therefore multiple files.

This however seems to be the norm when dealing with other developers who have come from backgrounds such as .Net, Java or straightforward C/C++. Hell I've had arguments with PHP developers and Ruby developers on naming conventions and code organization (inheritance vs instancing).

My experience aside. When dealing with other developers you have to bear in mind that they will often have a differing opinions as to how to write code. As a point in case your file: **MapViewController.swift** is using too many if - else statements between lines 32 - 49 which could be better handled by a ""switch"" clause. But that is my opinion. Honestly I believe the code I pointed out will be just fine. It is just an opinion.

Having said that I know for a fact that there are other people who treat their opinions as fact either because it is something that was etched into their psyche by a poor instructor or through some painful work experience in their past and they just cant let it go. Or perhaps they are just brain-damaged in a way neither of us can comprehend.

My point here is that their opinion should not matter to you. Having said that; if they have sway in this job that you want to be in, then to me you have two choices...

Your first choice is to accept their criticisms and use it to ""improve"" your code: you need to learn how to write code in the style of another person, not necessarily to make your code ""work"" but to make it ""work"" in a way that another person expects.

Your second choice is to ignore the criticism (despite what others may say and how they may react in this thread: your individualism is sacred... never ever let another opinion corrupt it unless you want it to). Keep writing code in the manner that you expect code to be written and improve your own processes or algorithms. F--k other opinions.

Now lets face the facts: you did not get this job. It is because one or more s--thead hates how you wrote your code. The bad thing has already happened.

If I were to try to write an app with a ""remote control"" to take pictures, one solution would be to set up a small webserver within the App that serves a webpage with a ""take picture"" link. You can navigate to that webpage with any other device (that's in the same local network), and click that link. The app then has to detect that that link was clicked, and can take a picture.

If you want to write an app that acts as the remote control, I'd try something like getting a connection up between the devices with WebSockets. There are a bunch of libraries for that, and the API is usually pretty simple. You can use the WebSocket to send a ""take picture"" message to your app.

If you want to be able to trigger picture taking from anywhere over the internet, you need to set up a server. In that case, I'd use push notifications to trigger the picture-taking (i.e., the server triggers a push notification that the app handles. How the user gets the server to trigger the notification is a separate problem - you could have the server serve a webpage, for example.)",1529607245.0

When there are instructions to go along with the picture they appear below the picture and are very terse.  Personally, I like to have descriptions above the images so I know what I'm looking at instead of wondering what the picture is trying to tell me.  Also I find it very hard to differentiate between the images and the single lines of text between them.  A little more vertical whitespace or some treatments to call out the separation would be great (might be hard to do as a github markdown page).

You also have some very large sections of code with little to no description of what you are doing (i.e. The above code is all about LoadPlaceData.swift.).  What is the main topic you are trying to teach me, using Parse, using Location APIs, using Map annotations, all of the above?  If you aren't teaching me about something maybe you can get away with sections of code that I don't need to know about, but I'd rather see complete tutorials teaching me about everything you are doing so I can choose what to gloss over because I already know it.

As a general thought step back from what you've written and think about who you've written it for.  I see a lot of assumptions made in your tutorial, like having cocoapods installed and knowing what it does.  Maybe you are writing for an audience that already knows this stuff, but if you aren't I can see someone easily getting lost in your tutorial.

I would break it up into sections so it's not so long.  Take the number of steps and group them into  a section.

You can create your own segues and use [UIViewControllerContextTransition](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontrollercontexttransitioning) and you can implement your own animations for segues.

ragnese,"I have a similar navigation setup with [SideMenu](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu). My architecture is like this:

* The window root VC is a UINavigationController
* AppDelegate has a method `func goTo(view: UIViewController)` described below
* My SideMenu data source involves giving a reference to the AppDelegate so that each menu entry makes a call to `app.goTo(view: choice)`.

Here is what `AppDelegate.goTo(view: UIViewController)` looks like:

        func goTo(view: UIViewController) {
            guard let navController = window?.rootViewController as? UINavigationController else {
                return
            }
    
            // If the top view controller is the same type as the parameter, do nothing.
            if let topViewController = navController.topViewController, topViewController.isMember(of: type(of: view)) {
                return
            }

            navController.popToRootViewController(animated: false)
            navController.pushViewController(view, animated: false)
        }

You need to dismiss any presented view so that it doesn't carry over to the next VC. I use `popToRootViewController` because you can't push the same VC to the navigationController multiple times, so this guarantees that wont be an issue.

Instead of passing around a reference to AppDelegate, you could just extend UINavigationController to have this method. Then it's just a matter of getting the navigation controller from within your VC and calling this method.

EDIT: You'd probably want to change the `animated: false`s to something else, but with SideMenu, the animations looked bad.",1529496303.0

GenitalGestapo,"Unfortunately, the `Authorization` header has some special behavior that can prevent directly setting it like that from working correctly, per [this documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutableurlrequest). There other ways to make sure it's set: 
 * Create your own `URLSession` instance, with your own `URLSessionConfiguration`, and add your `Authorization` header as one of the `httpAdditionalHeaders` on the configuration. You have to do this before initializing the `URLSession` with the configuration, as changes after init have no affect. However, this only works if your credentials never change, and will add the header to every request. 
 * Create a `URLCredential` and add it to `URLSession.shared.configuration.urlCredentialStorage`, but you'll have to look up how to manually create a `URLProtectionSpace` to go along with it, which is annoying. Setting a credential like this means `URLSession` will automatically retry your request when it gets an authorization challenge and return the credential for you.
 * Implement your own `URLSessionTaskDelegate` for your `URLSession`, and implement the `func urlSession(URLSession, task: URLSessionTask, didReceive: URLAuthenticationChallenge, completionHandler: (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?) -> Void)` method, which gives you a chance to again, create your credential and return it, but without the need to create your own `URLProtectionSpace`. Having your own delegate just for a single method is a pain in the ass though.
 * Use Alamofire, which implements all of the `URLCredential` logic for you.

To get the response status code, you need to keep a reference to your `task` and, when it's complete, access it like this: `(task.response as? HTTPURLResponse).statusCode`.

P.S. You can get `Data` from a `String` without an optional: `Data(string.utf8)`.

>	I understand most seasoned developers’ frustrations with Swift. It is by far not an easy language. Definitely, not the easy-to-learn language that Apple wants you to believe it is. 

I have a C++ and more recently a .NET background and didn’t find Swift that hard to pick up. It has a lot of features I wish were a native part of the .NET ecosystem like optional monads, non-nullable defaults, tuple-based dictionaries instead of KeyValuePair etc. What typically trips up newcomers to Swift in your experience? (It’s certainly not without quirks, but I haven’t felt the need to run screaming yet).

IMO, the accepted answer [here](https://www.quora.com/Why-would-Apple-introduce-new-programming-languages-e-g-Swift-instead-of-embracing-an-existing-one) sums up the ‘Swift: Because why?’ question pretty well.

My biggest uncertainty with the future of Swift and Objective-C comes from a comment Paul Hudson made in [this Sean Allen video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj6EOJ3W1TE&t=40m40s) recently where he mentioned there weren’t that many Swift developers inside Apple itself; most were still Objective-C based.

keath,"> the impedance mismatch between the language and the Cocoa/CocoaTouch stack 

This is the biggest issue with Swift for me.

Cocoa was built around the features of Objective-C: dynamic runtime, delegation, and graceful nil values.  Swift's optionals feel like a hack added only to work with Cocoa's nil values.  I'm not sure they are something that would have been added to the language if Apple hadn't needed that interoperability.

I enjoyed Dominik Wagner's post.  His criticism was fair.  Swift code is rarely elegant; but I think that is largely because it is interfacing with so much Objective-C code.

What is idiomatic Swift?  What would UIKit look like if it was written from the ground up in the language?  I'm hopeful that we [may find out one day](https://daringfireball.net/2018/04/scuttlebutt_regarding_ui_project).

- The REPL environment is not necessarily the most friendly to simple calculation. 

- You would have to significantly censor what you could do in the environment so that you don’t expose dangerous functionality that could be abused to compromise the entire operating system. 

- Requiring someone to have knowledge of programming in order to use the calculator is a significant barrier to usability.  

There are many more reasons this idea isn’t the best. Now, should the calculator app have some sort of limited programming environment in order to allow more complicated computations?

newbill123,"As far as whether ARC is a type of garbage collection, I think it *is* but it's not useful to refer to it that way. The pedantic answer is yes, since it is automated memory management and object reclamation, it is a type of garbage collection, but it is also very important not to confuse it with the types of tracing garbage collection used in Java, dotNet, or in Objective-C back in the Jaguar time-frame, so the practical answer is that it is not the type of Garbage Collection everyone expects when using the term.

But outside of vocabulary, what's the big difference?

In Swift you will have to think more about your model and object graph. The cyclic references (like the dog and owner example) are a design problem. They are real problems for the way Swift manages memory with ARC, because it can't detect those problems at runtime. You have to spot the problems when debugging with Leak detection tools, and then change the your object design to make it explicit who owns what references, and who is just using them if they exist. You will have to think deeper about your object graphs with Swift (in order to decide which references are strong and weak), but that is something you as a developer *can learn* and *can do* directly.

With something like tracing Garbage Collection, the problem is still there, but it's not important anymore. The computer has enough information to deallocate items when they aren't in use. But the tradeoff is that when you are using a GC runtime, it's performance is out of your control (even if you *know* what needs to be deallocated). You'll be fighting to optimize performance issues that you may not be able to deal with. For things like audio or video processing, the delay with GC may be unacceptably slow and not at all related to your object graphs.

If you are interested in why Swift doesn't adopt a Garbage Collector, this thread on Swift-Evolution two and a half years ago when Swift 3 was being hammered out explains some of the design decisions behind it:

[""What About Garbage Collection?"", Response 6, Chris_Lattner, Feb 2016, Swift-Evolution](https://forums.swift.org/t/what-about-garbage-collection/1360/6 )",1529086478.0
thisischemistry,"Th article talks about memory management and each language’s “garbage collector”. However, Swift does not use a garbage collector at all - it uses Automated Reference Counting (ARC). 

A garbage collector is a separate process that runs and periodically sweeps through memory, detecting unreferenced memory and ""collecting"" it, making it available for reuse. Reference counting is NOT a separate process, it keeps a count of every time the memory is referenced (retained) or un-referenced (released) and when that count drops to 0 it frees the memory. The performance and methodology of the two types of memory management are very different.

The article does go on to explain the difference between the methods but it continues to incorrectly call both methods ""garbage collection"". Classifying ARC as garbage collection is misstating the type of memory management and gives a tilted impression of the process.

**Edit:**

After reviewing some resources out there it appears that the term ""garbage collection"" has been significantly reframed over the years which adds to the confusion. Garbage collection used to only refer to the automated process of sweeping through memory and collecting up all the unused memory, freeing it up in bunches. Reference counting was not considered to be a form of garbage collection, rather it was a manual process of accounting that allowed the programmer to determine if the memory was still in use or not. Over time this process became automated.

Yes, both traditional garbage collection and reference counting ""collect the garbage"" memory but I believe it's incorrect and misleading to call them both garbage collection. However, since the end result is that unused memory is cleaned up it's understandable that people have lumped them together under one term. It's unfortunate because grouping them like this contributes to the confusion over the differences between the processes.",1529061279.0

thisischemistry,"Avoid force-unwrapping and implicitly-unwrapped `Optional` values whenever you can. They have their uses but they can create a ton of bugs unless you use them very carefully. That often takes knowledge and experience.

Some background:

Suppose you have some value, say you're converting strings to integers. All is good if you convert ""two"" to 2 or ""zero"" to 0 but what happens when you convert ""Bob"" to an integer? It doesn't make sense to give a bad conversion a value because how will you know if it's a bad conversion or an actual value? You could use some special value but that gets messy.

Instead you have extra data that indicates if you have a good value or no value. Swift wraps that up into an `Optional`. You can have an `Optional` of any other type, for example an `Optional<Int>` is an `Optional` that holds an integer.

You can ""unwrap"" an `Optional` to get the actual value, checking to see if it's good or bad. A bad `Optional` is `nil`, a good one has an actual value. You can also use an `Optional` without first checking it, that's what force-unwrapping or implicitly-unwrapping does. This can be very bad since there might not be an actual value inside! It will cause a crash or other undefined behavior.

Generally, Swift uses a question mark for safely unwrapping and an exclamation point for force-unwrapping. If you see a lot of exclamation points then that's a warning that unsafe things may be happening. As I said, there are ways that force unwrapping can be pretty safe but it generally takes experience to make sure that's happening.

There's one other use for the exclamation point and that's the ""not"" operator, it turns a `true` value into a `false` one or a `false` value into a `true` one. So not all exclamation points indicate danger.",1529017780.0

Teamwork is hard under the best circumstances. Most successful teams work hard to make it a success (the team, not the project) but most don’t really try. There is a widely held belief that great teams happen naturally. They do but rarely.  When the team is spread across locations and time zones, it is even harder for a team to be great (the team, not the project!) so if they’re not actively trying to make it work, it might not. 

Of course, teams that think great teamwork happens naturally may also think remote members don’t require extra work because they don’t think teams require extra work. 

Some types of projects lend themselves to remote workers more than other types of projects. Projects that require long whiteboard idea sessions are harder with remote team members, support for legacy code may be easier.

The good news is that almost every company does some sort of remote work now whether it is dealing with clients or vendors or team members, so they’re all (slowly?) getting better at it.

codevil,"Funny that in our meeting just a few hours ago, I declared to the team that moving forward, I’ll almost exclusively be configuring views in XIBs and only write in code the parts that need to be dynamically set.

Previously, I’ve only ever used XIBs to make Autolayout constraints and then write everything else in code. The reason is that when I’m working in a team, some devs aren’t really familiar with the view initialization lifecycle so they end up screwing things up. Writing it in code makes clear and explicit exactly what happens. This time, though, I decided that it’s an iOS developer’s job to know the view and the nib initialization cycle and I am no longer adjusting to another programmer’s laziness to read the Apple documentation.

When you have an extremely complex view with scrollable pictures, embedded map and street views, expandable sections, and various kinds of controls, writing the constraints in code takes up so much time—and so does reading it, from the POV of another programmer. But what do views do in an MVC environment done right? Display values without knowing anything about them, and look pretty. They’re dumb components. You ought to be spending more time thinking out and writing or refactoring your controllers, utilities, factories, operations, protocols, because those are the things that truly make the product work and create value.

jasamer,"I don't like segues, either (especially the annoying casting in `prepareForSegue`). 

However... when working with separate xibs for each controller, you can keep most type-safety and still configure your views in Interface Builder. 
You just have a ""normal"" init for your controller. 


    class SomeViewController: UIViewController {
        private let isUserLoggedIn: Bool
        
        init(isUserLoggedIn: Bool, backgroundColor: UIColor) {
            self.isUserLoggedIn = isUserLoggedIn

        required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
            fatalError(""init(coder:) has not been implemented"")
        }
    }

The biggest advantage is that you use this controller exactly like you would use one of your controllers that are written entirely in code (we can make `isUserLoggedIn` private!), but you can still configure the UI in Interface Builder. There are also no type-safety issues in code (the xib can still be misconfigured of course).

Having the fatal-error implementation for the `initWithCoder` is ugly, but I found that in most cases, I didn't need or use a proper implementation.

For example, if your view changes between different variations at runtime, have an IBInspectable bool that you can toggle and which will change the state as it appears in the editor. If your view doesn't appear as it will at runtime when you look at it in the editor, you aren't using your visual designer's (IB) #1 advantage, which is not having to run your application and see changes reflected immediately.

lucasvandongen,"It's very funny how some people get angry with me when I say that optionals and force-unwrapping are things you should really really really try to avoid yet intuitively at the same time a lot of people just feel that especially Storyboards are too much based on loose sand.

**Interface Builder, good points:**

* Can layout and test how things work 99% WYSIWYG, also change the device size with one click, very powerful
* That's why it's always faster than program, run the app, find a layout problem, repeat, try iPad, find new problems, repeat no matter what code advocates try to tell you. If it's slower you just don't know your tools
* Better separation of layouts and code, UIViews tend to be lighter
* Direct feedback on what screen does what
* Test animations by enabling disabling constraints and see if they would work
* Gives immediate warnings and errors if you have errors in your layout

**Interface Builder, bad points:**

* Storyboards have no custom init's (but XIB's do), prepareForSegue is very brittle
* IBOutlets can possibly not be connected, no compile-time warning or error if this is the case 
* IBOutlets with ? are cumbersome, IBOutlets with ! will crash your app. Both approaches suck
* Rendering the complete UI (including code side layout) is (haven't tried Xcode 10 yet) slow
* Reusing view code is cumbersome because you need to turn on live rendering that makes your machine slow or kind of guess what it will be like run-time

**Code, good points:**

* Building generic screens (like a list of objects that have their own tablecell in a generic way) cannot be done without using code
* Always a good constructor
* Reusing code no penalty
* No IBOutlets no ! or ?
* Easier to re-use styles (though things are getting better for colors!)

**Code, bad points:**

* To see the results of your code you need to run the app
* No immediate feedback about warnings or errors while typing your code
* NSLayoutConstraint is somewhat cumbersome, but it did improve and libraries exist

My ideal would be compile-time checked IBOutlets and Storyboards that support  segues that cannot be triggered without passing in the data required by the init of the ViewController. If that would be the case I would not touch coded views unless I had to do some kind of Enterprise-y app that would do a lot of CRUD on different types of data, so a pretty boring looking app that requires generics. 

I actually migrated an application like two years ago that was just that from Storyboards to code and it made making new screens so much easier because I could basically re-use 90% off the other screens. Another good reason would be some kind of super custom rendering that just doesn't work well in IB. Actually that same application used a sort of Material like shades on all the cards including TableViews and it had a ton of code to make it look well (anybody that attempted something like this knows what I'm talking about). Forget about IB then.

I'm doing an application now that is kind of hybrid with a lot of HTML based screens and a few core screens that need to be performant that are native and done with code because I wanted everything to be ""tight"" instead of that IBOutlets loose sand structure. While the UI is much easier to drive from code I really hated doing all the small tweaks I needed to, putting chins on stuff to make it look nice for iPhone X etcera. And I have a pretty nice handcrafted AL library that makes AL code look like written English, so it's easy to write to code by itself. Also the UI really isn't that complex compared by previous apps.

If I compare it to doing HTML / CSS layouts I can take a webpage, then start fiddling with CSS and HTML until something works and then save or copy that. But I start in ""code"" mode. JavaScript is freely accessible up to the point I can replace complete functions while the page is running and then call them. This kind of freedom can never exist with Xcode / Swift / iOS for obvious reasons but a way to easy tweak layouts while being in Debug View Hierarchy would be super great to test all kinds of stuff while you are creating your layouts in code.


My takeaway as things are now:

* Applications with a lot of different screens are probably better off done with IB (with a dash of coded views for reusability)
* Applications that have a lot of similar screens are probably better off done in code
* Both approaches lack tooling and options to make them really great",1528568522.0

Uupis,"I occasionally try the Storyboard/xib route, but if it's something I intend to keep/use/maintain for longer periods of time, I invariably resort to rewriting views in code at some point. It's a struggle between wanting to write less code, so as to have less to debug, versus working in a code base comfortably. On an infinite timescale, any actively-used and worked-on personal project will become as IB-free as feasible.

Maybe I am using Interface Builder wrong, but it just never seems to scale nicely for me. I feel like it's much, much simpler to compose several small view controllers in code than in the storyboard way. On the flip side, layout does grow my view controller code by – rough guesstimate – some 25% or more. It's not ideal. Though, I am really fond of [Chris Eidhof's auto layout DSL](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/micro-autolayout-dsl/) – and it's so small, one can ostensibly write it or a variation of it in a few minutes.

Additionally, if I try to go all-in on the IBDesignable stuff, the whole thing turns unbearably slow. It becomes a sort of *resistance point* for when I have to open Interface Builder for one reason or another. ""Oh no, it's going to try to transmogripile something and something's going to get stuck *again* or whatever, yada yada yada.""

Maybe I'm reaching, but it also feels akin to the ""single source of truth"" principle – in code all my view and layout is captured in one file, preferably grouped in one section of that file. It's not always a *happy* section, but it is what it is.",1528707949.0
cyancynic,"Separating allocation from initialization isn't a language thing.  Its an architecture thing.

There is a whole lot of stuff in a VC that you never see.  Its in the superclass and also in the view management machinery.  Lots of fancy stuff happens to a VC when it is presented and when it is un-presented (think digging deeper in a navigation controller, then backing out).

nibs/xibs are more than just layout.  This mechanism allows you to specify an arbitrary assembly of objects of any class and then get an instance of that structure anytime you like.  Given the platform's Smalltalk inspiration/history, this makes perfect sense and can be useful for loadable bundles (plugins).

Finally, I have to tell you I get really fucking tired of the beating of the ""type safe"" drums.

The world has fucking data in it.  Data isn't typesafe.  Its fucking data.  Learn to deal with the fucking data.  Its not going to be typesafe.  The world isn't that neat and TBH, the endless harping on type safety is comes across as infantile whining.

In general, when building any non-trivial system, it is better to prefer data to code.  That's why we put pick list options in databases rather than the code.  The cost of changing data is about 1/10 the cost of changing code.

I use xibs and storyboards a lot and I find them useful.  I particularly like that I can have different storyboards for iPad than for iPhone and not need to change a line of code.  So there's that.

By doing `Date()` you capture the time and date of the moment that object is created as a time interval from a reference time and date. You then choose how to deal with that date through things like `Calendar` and `DateFormatter`.

For example - if I wanted to create an array of `Date` objects, each 15 minutes later than the current one, and all in UTC:

    import Foundation

    if let utc = TimeZone(identifier: ""UTC"") {
      var calendar = Calendar(identifier: .gregorian)
      calendar.timeZone = utc
      let current = Date()
      let dates = (0...5).compactMap {
        calendar.date(byAdding: .minute, value: $0 * 15, to: current)

      let formatter = ISO8601DateFormatter()

,"I don’t see why not. You can download anything you want as a file, and instantiate a storyboard from any file (right?)",1528333740.0
AssBoon92,"Maybe? Drilling down into an app install on the simulator, the storyboards are all contained in a folder called Base.lproj (IIRC, this folder is for the base localization... if you localize further, you will end up with either different folders or subfolders representing the UI in various localizations).

The files in here have the extension ""storyboardc"" for me, which makes me wonder if there is some compilation going on. Base storyboards are just fancy plist files, so I would imagine these are compiled in some way before delivery. That's probably listed when you build. Indeed, it is compiled (example from a project I just built):

> CompileStoryboard 
~/Cocoa/iOS/Distance/Distance/Base.lproj/Main.storyboard

The build process then includes this step (bold for emphasis):

>LinkStoryboards (in target: Distance)
    cd ~/Cocoa/iOS/Distance
    export XCODE_DEVELOPER_USR_PATH=~/Desktop/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/..
    ~/Desktop/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/ibtool --errors --warnings --notices --module Distance --target-device iphone --target-device ipad --minimum-deployment-target 11.0 --output-format human-readable-text --link ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Distance-hivoiopgnohmluamoaeyrpjhmebx/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/Distance.app **~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Distance-hivoiopgnohmluamoaeyrpjhmebx/Build/Intermediates.noindex/Distance.build/Debug-iphoneos/Distance.build/Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.storyboardc**
**~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Distance-hivoiopgnohmluamoaeyrpjhmebx/Build/Intermediates.noindex/Distance.build/Debug-iphoneos/Distance.build/Base.lproj/Main.storyboardc**

So Xcode is doing some linking, which I have never understood (e.g. linker command failed), but I would guess that a few things are true:

1. You can't do this outside of Xcode or the command line
2. It needs to be done at build time
3. You probably don't have access to the place where it needs to go
4. Changes in the storyboard would result in changes in the binary that is signed

Don't assume that you know for certain that a value is set properly, what if someone else comes along and modifies the code so it's no longer set at that point?

There are a very few good instances to force-unwrap or to use a force-unwrapped `Optional`. One is during instantiation of an object, you can be pretty sure the object won't be used before it's initialized so you can use a force-unwrapped `Optional` as a placeholder so long as by the end of initialization the variable is set properly.

Checking if a variable is `nil` is not a bad thing, sometimes all you care about is if the variable is valid or not. But it usually leads to actually using the variable, in that case you don't incur much cost to actually unwrap the variable vs checking for `nil`.",1528284465.0

Well, *you* (the author of code) might, but I (the reader of the code, or perhaps even the author, some time after forgetting about it) don't. That's the point of optionals: they express your intent and assumptions directly in code, in a compiler verified way.

b_t_s,"Using force/implicit unwrap without good justification is absolutely unprofessional. You're saying ""shut up compiler and just crash the app if I or anyone who touches this code isn't perfect"". Over hundreds of thousand of lines of code you're bound to make mistakes many, many times.  If you ever make a mistake in an important but poorly tested place, your laziness can cost serious money and piss off hundreds of thousand of people.  All because you were too lazy or willfully ignorant to use the tools the language provides.  Sure you or QA will notice your mistake maybe 97% of the time, but it's not like handling optionals safely is significantly more difficult.

    if(!(optionalClass!.anOptionalBool!))
    vs
    if(optionalClass?.anOptionalBool == false)

So you squeeze out 5 characters and risk a crash on some probably non-critical feature?  That's amateur hour.  On the pro side, when optionals are being annoying, often that's a sign that you're being sloppy in other ways.  You can eliminate a lot of optionals by doing dependency injection(if num is required, then pass it into init) or setting reasonable defaults(can num default to 0) . The better you get at optionals the fewer of them you have, and the more useful and meaningful the remaining ones are.  Going from an optional disciplined codebase back to obj-c or sloppy swift where you have to nil check *everything bleeping thing* just in case is pull your hair out frustrating.

JimDabell,"Swift has given us a type system that can make sure that our code is always forced to handle cases where a variable might be `nil` instead of making a mistake by forgetting to do so.  Your colleague is suggesting that you ignore that incredibly useful tool and instead rely on humans reading the code and thinking about it to make sure that it's correct.  In the absolute best case scenario, it's a higher effort way of doing the same thing the compiler could be doing for you automatically.  But humans make mistakes, so you're not in that scenario.  You're in the scenario where needless crashes occur.  *""It's okay, I know for sure I'm right and haven't made a mistake, so I don't need checks to make sure""* is not an attitude that results in robust, high-quality code.

Aside from the *direct* issues, there's also the indirect issues. In good code, `!` is unusual and sticks out.  It's a warning sign that says *""Hey, this code is dangerous, pay close attention!""*  It can also be picked up by lint rules.  If you are writing code that has `!` all over the place, you're training yourself to ignore this warning sign and you're making it difficult to use those sorts of lint rules.

thisischemistry,"A [`Bundle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle) is a group of resources for an application.

Calling a type like `Bundle(...)` means that you are calling an `init` method: a method that creates and initializes an instance of that type. In this case you are calling [`init(for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle/1417717-init), which gives you the `Bundle` object that contains the specified `class`.

The function [`type(of:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/2885064-type) returns the `class` type for a given instance of a `class`.

The specifier `self` refers to the current type that the code is running inside of. If the code is part of the `String` type then the type returned would be `String.Type`.

When you use `let bundle = ` that assigns whatever comes after the `=` to the variable `bundle` as a constant.

Is there a feature in Xcode you *just* follow the instructions, such as ""Press the third  icon to open the Object Library."" It's okay if that's the case, there's a *LOT* to learn.

But if so, changes to the interface may not fit with what your tutorial told you to do. If you have the time to look for the command to open the Object library window (instead of pane), you'll be fine. But you'll also be distracted from what the tutorial was trying to teach you.

On the other hand, the tutorial won't mention features that were not in the prior versions of Xcode (like comment folding, or multi-line editing) so you may actually be told to edit something in a way that hides the new features from you.

colonel_hahous,"Well I’m no expert on this subject but I feel your pain so I will try to help. 

The problem is caused by that fact that you’re trying to share a single account which is officially only supposed to be used by a single person on a single machine. I’m guessing that each time one person in your team “fixes” their code signing issues they are also essentially invalidating everyone else’s. This is caused by the signing certificate being tied to a private key which is only stored on the machine that sets up the signing cert. 

My recommendation is that you spend the time to setup fastlane. Specifically ‘fastlane match’. Fastlane is an awesome set of tools that can do all sorts of cool stuff for an iOS project but most specifically it will help you securely share your certificates and profiles between all the devs in your team using a separate git repository. You are already using git right? 

I’d like to tell you there is a silver bullet and that you just need to do X. Unfortunately code signing has always been, and will always be, a pain in the ass but tools like fastlane provide just enough lube to make it bearable.

As others have pointed out fastlane is great stuff. But I feel it's getting ahead of things a bit. I know I'm late in the game but let me ask a few questions:

1. What do you use as source control and does it provide pull requests?
2. If you are using something like github, can you set it up so you have to approve all PRs? Your current system is just frustrating you, and always stop issues asap. This way you can make others fix their mistakes themselves.
3 .gitignore, as suggested, grab the standard github one for iOS.:)
4. Make sure to remove the files gitignore would ignore before checking it in. If they are already there they stay in the repo. If any of this sounds weird, please message me and I'll help. This will fuck you up if it gets wrong. Git is great, but it's also very poweruser.
5. Do not share the wrong XCode settings, some should stay private. Gitignore to the rescue!
6. If you aren't publishing this, letting XCode handle the signing 100%. Why do it the hard way?
7. Do everyone have their own Apple developer account? If not, everyone must. You be the agent and you can give everyone the right access. You will have the main keys etc. These will be needed for CI and publishing and such.
8. Very seriously consider CI and pushing to TestFlight and have the app installed on real devices from there. Are you wasting your time loading the app on others devices?
9. You need to know what files can and can not be merged. Cowboy coding with iOS you will shoot yourself in the foot with a tactical nuke. Do you and your team know? If not, message me:)

 In the method itself, after the method's name and before the method's arguments (no arguments in this example) you declare that you're going to be using a generic object A (that's the <A part). You then declare that this object will be a NSManagedObject or a subclass (that's the : NSManagedObject> part). This function will return an object A with the characteristics you declared before (this is the -> A part). Furthermore, this A object will conform to the Managed protocol (this is the where A: Managed).   
  
When you use the method you declare that the mood variable will be an instance of Mood, so the compiler knows that the inserObject method should return an instance of Mood. This infers the type of A that the method's implementation uses. If the Mood object is not an NSManagedObject or does not conform to the protocol Managed you would get a compiler error.

YawnsMcGee,DARK MODE XCODE. FINALLY. ABOUT DAMN TIME.,1528143849.0
,[deleted],1528072845.0
,"Your example isn't exactly object-oriented anyway. All the information that you have on your movies are the name and the release year. Not terribly useful. What if you wanted a bunch of things?

	class Movie {
		var name: String
		var studio: String
		var releaseYear: Int
		var boxOfficeGross: Int
		var director: String
		var actors: [String]
		var awards: [String]
		
		func download(from: URL) { ... }
		func rate(stars: Double) { ... }
		
		var description: String {
			return ""\(name), released in \(releaseYear)""
		}
	}

This is still not ""great Swift"", but it's a better representation.

You're welcome to try to put all of these attributes in their own little arrays/dictionaries, but you'll soon have trouble organizing your code. Even if you want to stick to top-level functions, it's way easier to keep related data together. Compare:

	var movies: [String: Movie] = [...]
	func print(movieNamed name: String) {
		print(movies[name]?.description ?? ""<missing movie>"")
	}

versus:

	var movieYears: [String: Int]
	var movieStudios: [String: String]
	// (4 more dictionaries)
	func print(movieNamed name: String) {
		guard let releaseYear = movieYears[name] else {
			print(""<missing movie>"")
			return
		}
		guard let studio = movieStudios[name] else {
			print(""<missing movie>"")
			return
		}
		print(""\(name), released in \(releaseYear) by \(studio)"")
	}

The most obvious use case for a class or a struct is to keep related things together. This has several practical benefits that I can call out off the top of my head:

* When you need to look up a record, all of the information is in one place already. You don't need to bother to check that every dictionary is consistent, for instance: the movie is either there or not, it can't be in the `movieYears` dictionary but not in the `movieStudios` dictionary.
* The language supports niceties that assume that your data is grouped together in objects. I didn't do it here to avoid unneeded complexity, but by declaring `Movie` as `class Movie: CustomStringConvertible`, it becomes possible to pass a `Movie` object directly to `print` or to create a `String` from it. Swift's most powerful features are all about using classes and structs, and you will miss out on literally all of them if you stay away from objects.
* When you type `variable.` in the IDE, it can get you a contextual list of everything that you can do with the variable. If you only use free functions, your only context is ""everything"". This makes it more difficult to discover things about your code... or to remember how to use it.

People also figured out a bunch of patterns that use objects to simplify development, but that's not fundamental.",1528078507.0
jackasstacular,"Simplified answer - classes usually encapsulate data and the means with which that data is accessed and changed. The data is private and can only be accessed by the functions provided by the class; this allows the programmer to better control what actions can be performed on the data and what values the data can contain.

madiyar,"This should be fast enough:

    let N = 2000001

    var isPrime = [Bool](repeating: true, count: N)
    isPrime[0] = false
    isPrime[1] = false

    for i in stride(from: 4, to: N, by: 2) {
       isPrime[i] = false
    }

    var sum = 2
    for p in 3 ..< N where isPrime[p] {

         isPrime[i] = false
      }
    }
    print (sum)


There are two tricks:

- ""for i in stride(from: p * p, to: N, by: 2 * p)"" - we can start from *p * p* rather than *p + p*, because a number of form *k * p* should be already marked by a smaller prime number, as it is divisible by a smaller number than p (at least by k). 

- ""for i in stride(from: p * p, to: N, by: 2 * p)"" - we stride by 2 * p rather than p, because p is an odd number (for this reason we handled 2 separately) and odd + odd is an even number which is already marked by 2. For example, lets say that p = 3, so our algorithm will mark **6**, 9, **12**, 15, **18**, ..., so on. We can skip even numbers: **6**,  **12**, **18**.

Find a simple ""problem"" or goal that can be solved with a simple App, in like 3-5 screens at most. It can be anything: taking note of monthly expenses, searching github users and showing their repositories, pulling weather data for some city, etc.

Then work on the solution in small steps, always asking for each feature you do:
 
- What feature you're building?
- What's the minimum you need to make it work?
- Where will it be located in the App, which screen?
- How will you show it happening in the App?
- What UI elements do you need?

Then, search for tutorials on the specific things you need to learn to make it work and build them. When you're done with the basics, ask where can you improve your code, how can you make things work independently, what should can you add to improve the project.

You can assign a function to be called when a specific kind of gesture occurs (e.g. a tap).
For every tap this function is called... actually the function is called several time per tap indicating that the gesture: started, changed, canceled and/or ended (“changed” make no sense for a tap, but it is very useful for other gestures like swipes).

Now in your gesture handler function you can start a timer. This produce a variable of type Timer that can call a function when it expires.

So you have it.
1) every tap will trigger your tap function
2) you can start a timer and check at every tap if the timer is active (not expired) and react accordingly.
3) when the timer expires a timer handler function is called

[this](https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/ios-architecture-patterns-ecba4c38de52) will also help you on MVC in text if you prefer.

To add on to what /u/ZypherXX said, your model should NOT communicate with your view, and vice versa. Your view(buttons) should call a function in your view controller, then your viewcontroller should initialize the model object and call whichever function you need to call to update, or process. Your model should only communicate with your viewcontroller and your viewcontroller should update the UI accordingly if needed. 

There are 3 ways to pass data between the model and viewcontroller. Delegate pattern, Completion handlers, and KVO Observation via NotificationCenter. [This](https://nalexn.github.io/blog/2017/01/28/callbacks-part-1-delegation-notificationcenter-kvo/) article has more on that.

ZypherXX,"Whenever I follow MVC, I implement a Model Controller to initialize model objects and perform functions, such as when you want to create a user account or something. So for example, you have an Account object you want to create, which has a username, email and password. Within a ModelController\(so in this case AccountController\), you will want to initialize that object, and create a function such as:

        func createAccount(username: String, password: String, email: String, completion: @escaping ((Account) -> Void) {
                let account = Account(username: username, password: password, email: email)
                // SAVE IN COREDATA STACK OR PERFORM A NETWORK CALL THEN HANDLE THE ERROR AND
                    COMPLETION //      
                
    } 

You never want to initialize model objects in a ViewController, always use some sort of delegate as a messenger between both. Then to actually implement it into a ViewController just follow something like:

        @IBACTION func createUserAccountFromButton(_ sender: Any?) {
            createAccount()
    }
    
          func createAccount() {
            let username = username.textField.text
            let password = password.textField.text
            let email = password.textField.text // Probably should unwrap this safely with a

This provides a great performance boost.

Fundamentally it's not really that bit which provides great performance boosts, it's that inlining allows ""cross-function"" optimisations: generally speaking the compiler optimises functions individually, but after you've inlined a function inside another the compiler can optimise that as a unit, and can propagate requirements and assumptions out of functions to unlock further optimisations.

And thus [Inlining is the most important compiler optimisation pass [because] it enables most other optimisation opportunities](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Inlining). It's also a balancing act because inlining everything means lots of duplications and functions which don't fit in caches anymore, cratering your performances, which is why inline annotations are a risky business and generally not recommended.",1527582828.0

lolcoderer,"It is my opinion that none of these modern-ish languages (Swift, rust, go) meet the demands of a cross-platform development infrastructure. The main problem is that developing a systems framework that includes GUI + networking + process control + networking APIs + file system APIs + timing APIs + (insert personal need here) - is severely lacking. Apple has checked off all of the above with Cocoa / UIKit - but only on macOS and iOS. They have shown no interest in moving Cocoa to other platforms.

Rust doesn’t even have a framework similar to Cocoa / UIKit - so it is even further behind.

I think your question is very difficult to answer without fully understanding your project scope.

At the current state of framework development, it is not the OS that determines what language we develop in - it is the needs of the application that determines what language + framework we develop in.

Do you simply want to display some nice looking pie charts, line charts while playing with various cloud based data sources? Python and Jupyter might be all you need.

Are you interested in developing the next cross-platform Minecraft / video game? You are pretty much stuck with choosing between Unity (C#) vs Unreal (C++).

Are you trying to develop a cross-platform audio plugin? Right now your best choice is Juce (C++).

Maybe all you want is to create shaders for VDJ performances - or maybe even something a little custom for lighting designers to use - your choices are pretty much limited to Max/MSP, TouchDesigner, or even Juce.

My point is... your problem space defines the framework and language you will need to work with.

There's a package or some obscure tool built in those languages and built everyday. They also have client libraries. Let me know if some api provider provides an api client for Swift ? ",1527566880.0
ragnese,"I'll post a potentially unpopular opinion: Swift is not that great of a language \(yet?\). I've used it in two iOS apps and on a small backend project, back when its Linux support was very incomplete. I would not use it outside of iOS \(It's way nicer to work with than ObjC\- I'll give it that\).

There are fundamental things that Swift does that are wrong, IMO. It conflates type definition, reference/copy semantics, and heap/stack allocations. Those things should be orthogonal, and the fact that they aren't in Swift makes it hard to write good, reusable code.

Swift also lacks any type of namespacing. Even Java has this with packages. If you don't want to go through the ceremony of making a Framework, the closest thing you have is to create a class with a private init\(\) and all static methods. This is like 90's C\+\+/Java style ""namespacing.""

Swift generics and protocols don't mix well, which means you have either copy\+paste code or horrible spaghetti code with redundant protocol definitions and/or ugly runtime casts where the compiler *should* know more than it does.

The standard library is also weirdly lacking in basic stuff: there's no stack data structure, for example.

There are certain languages that just go with certain domains: Javascript for web frontend, Python for data science (although Julia is pretty cool...), Swift for iOS.

Frankly, Kotlin and Rust are both better languages than Swift. Kotlin will be easier to learn, since it's garbage collected- plus you get access to the whole Java ecosystem.

Honestly, C++ has a really great language buried inside of it. If you follow modern best practices (all smart pointers, const everywhere, single inheritance, rely on STL algorithms), you can write really nice, safe, code that is very fast as well.",1527604708.0

As time goes on, some languages that are strong, start to become weak.  Look at ObjC in iOS 5 years ago, now ObjC is a ""good to know to get a job in iOS"" because more and more are using Swift.

thisischemistry,"Swift and Objective-C are [very compatible](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html), by design. A mixed project is 100% viable and should be your plan going forward.

Your first step should be to [modernize your Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/ObjectiveC/ModernizationObjC/AdoptingModernObjective-C/AdoptingModernObjective-C.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014150).

You might also have to write some bridging headers so that Swift can properly translate your Objective-C interfaces.

I would certainly code anything new in Swift. Come up with a plan of what Objective-C code you're going to convert into Swift. I'd stick to things that you were going to revise anyways. Difficult code can be left for later. You can go quite a long time with a mixed project and very little issues.",1527423226.0
aepryus,"I have done both ""new code in Swift"" and ""big bang"" approaches.  NCiS actually works quite well; it was a lot less hassle than I was expecting.  If the existing Objective-C code base is good, I would seriously consider it.  You can then move over old code piecemeal.  One issue I ran into is that an Objective-C class can not extend a Swift one, so it will be necessary to move over entire hierarchies at one time.

On the other hand, if the Objective-C code is suboptimal, the ""big bang"" approach may be preferable.  However, this really is a pretty challenging option.  I have recently been 'big bang'ing all my personal projects, while modernizing library usage and such.  The projects are big and involved and it has been slow and tedious and frustratingly bug riddled.  Although, I'm not attempting to just translate code; I'm combining it with major refactoring.  So, perhaps a straight translation job would be a lot more straightforward.

kleneau,"As a developer and a manager of an iOS team I'd say you should strongly consider the migration but you need to have a team that is dedicated to the effort and you **need a plan**. My team has done both the hybrid approach and the full conversion plan and we're currently in the process of migrating an SDK to full swift. Our approach was a bit different as we had to keep releasing SDK version.

The decision to convert is not universal so you need to consider:

1. The caliber of the team \(senior vs junior devs\), working with fewer and stronger devs is always best but it's not always the case.
2. How much new development is planned and what's the timing of that effort, can you afford the downtime?
3. How many of your dependencies are swift friendly?
4. How many unit tests, UI tests or manual tests do you have to validate things are working?

The advantages of migrating to Swift to name a few are:

1. Modern code base for new developers joining the job market / company / project.
2. New patterns, practices and dependencies are all centered around Swift, even Apple's newer examples are Swift so support of Swift will be greater that Obj\-C long term.
3. Type and null safety, Obj\-c is nice if you like a lose language but it will bit you. You will often find bugs you didn't know about if you migrate to Swift \(like someone mentioned\).
4. Investment from Apple and the Community is greater than Obj\-C will be from here on out. Sure, Obj\-c might get some nice features, but that is usually in the bucket of ""will this API work better with swift"" \(i.e. Nullability and Generics\).
5. Lastly, your devs will be happy and your retention will increase.

Like I said, my team is currently going through this with an SDK project \(this is where my comment adds value and compelled me to post\). When we talked the possibilities of doing this we had an App that was nearly all swift, we had added nullability and generics to most of the public interface and we had nearly 700\+ unit tests and 50 some integration tests. Our SDK has iOS, tvOS, watchOS and macOS targets along with Unit and Functional test targets. Below is a glimpse of our approach.

1. Clean up the public interface, delete what's considered dead code and reduce the surface area. We all have dead code in the app and it's better to cut ties with it is then convert it. If you need the code you can always get it from source control again.
2. Created a shared branch for team of 4 to work in. We also used a google sheet to track what's been done and by whom.
3. We started by converting all our objective\-c in our test targets first to get a feel for how much work it would be. We ended up using a tool called [Swiftify](http://swiftify.com) (no, I do not work for them and they are not paying me to say this) to convert some areas of tests.
4. The 4 person team then divided up to ""fix"" the converted code and integrate it into the project. Once there were happy with the swift code they would delete the objective-c code and mark the Google Sheet they were done, then they would push to the branch.
5. Since I paid for (expensed) an unlimited plan of [Swiftify](http://swiftify.com) I would then convert more stuff and send to the team in Slack.
6. And repeat all in the test target until we had the test target compiling and running back to 100%. No tests were lost in the process. This resulted in a mostly objective-c SDK with swift tests supporting it. Once this was done we raised a PR to master and integrated the changes.
7. We took a similar ""divide and conquer"" approach with the public interface and internals of the SDK. We just completed about 50% of the interface and are now integrating it into the app.

[Swiftify](http://swiftify.com) is decent and will get you about 80% complete with working code. It will get you far enough that modifying the last 20% is pretty easy if you know the code base well enough. It's not a perfect tool like the Android (Java to Kotlin) devs have but then again what that have is not perfect either and the style of you code is highly dependent on your teams preferences.

KarlJay001,"I see two main ways to do this.  First is to make a new project and keep working on it while doing whatever is needed to the other project.  Second is to start writing universal routines in Swift one by one.  They both work together, so you can go thru one by one and start writing routines from ObjC to Swift one by one.

Personally, I'd pick the first one.  Start from zero and take advantage of everything that you know about the program and Swift to make it much better than what you had before.

lucasvandongen,"On mobile now so just a condensed answer: revisit your architecture and make better separations. For example you could put all your model code in one new subproject. Use this opportunity to clean up your boundaries and write unit or integration tests. 

Next move all of your business logic out of your view / viewcontroller or model layers. Take every decision in one subproject. I often coordinate with several Event enums and EventHandlers. It’s easy to fake those events during testing. Any call to Model or ViewController layers should be through easily mockable protocols.

Now what’s left is your VC / V layer. It will receive precise commands from your business layer like `show(loggedInUser: User)` now through those protocols I made you make before. I would keep working “dumb” UI code in Objective-C as Objective-C gels better with XIBs IMHO in terms of optionals in IBOutlets etcetera.

      case ace, two, three, four, five, six, seven

The need for a `static let all` in an `enum` is going to [go away soon](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0194-derived-collection-of-enum-cases.md) so that will simplify this further.

I made them a raw value of type `String` for easy conversion to and from that type. You could easily leave that out or use another raw value type like `Int` if that is better for your use-case. 

Note that I changed a lot of the `var` to `let` and I'm initializing them as stored properties rather than using computed ones. IMO, it makes a bit more sense to do these once rather than every single time you access them. You could do them in a more lazy manner if you like but I don't think that's necessary here.

Also, try to put base functionality into the initial declarations of the types and anything extra in an extension. It keeps your code a bit cleaner, you can clearly see the difference between base functionality and added functionality.

I'd add this for an simple way to get a full deck of cards:

    extension PlayingCard {
      static let deck: Set<PlayingCard> = {
        var cards = Set<PlayingCard>()
        for suit in Suit.all {
          for rank in Rank.all {
            cards.insert(PlayingCard(suit: suit, rank: rank))
          }
        }
        return cards
      }()
    }

It's a common thing for entry level people trying to get into iOS, seems it's a lot harder to get into.

Con__Man,"I'm no developer or anything, more of a guy familiar with computer science in general. But here is my 2 cents. Also, this might be a better question for the jobs subreddit: r/jobs 

First tailor your resume/CV and your profile on the job posting site. Make sure your profiles and resume have the common buzzwords that recruiters likely search when they sift through people's info. These sites often let you make your resume available to employers, so it may be worth doing that (recruiters have contacted me probably due to including those buzzwords on my resume that I made public)

Try other sites besides LinkedIn. Indeed, Monster, etc. That could help others find you. Craigslist may even be an option, a friend of mine found something through the job postings on Craigslist (just take care cause it might seem kinda sketchy).

Third thing is to maybe broaden your search terms and don't strictly search iOS. Even if companies want iOS developers specifically, the recruiters/hiring team might not be knowledgable and post ads that don't specifically list iOS. You might be able to get noticed by including other programming languages and general programming terms. If you can work with other programming languages, then it may be best to just get a programming-related job then try and eventually swing into iOS specifically.

This is all based on my little experience with Comp. Sci. career searching. So hopefully someone more knowledgable can correct me or add on. Job searching can be tough, especially in a competitive field like programming, so keep pushing.",1527208225.0

-	LinkedIn works to a degree. It’s an avenue for opportunities, but should never be your only avenue.
-	Put your CV on job boards and take the calls you get from recruiters
-	Present your non-tech experience from a tech angle
-	Be clear about the tech projects you built, link to Github projects, but be prepared for people to not look at your portfolio and only use your CV. Polish that CV like your live depends on it and test it with friends, bosses, and contractors.
-	Don’t trust all recruiters, but aim to build bonds with some of them. I’m saying that because there’s a lot of cowboys out there and you just need to make some good, reliable contacts and stick with them
-	At the same time treat recruiters with respect and appreciation. The end up doing a lot of work for you and they’re not as bad as most tech people make them out to be
-	Talk to recruiters about your ethics and preferences, that way you won’t be pushed into rubbish roles or companies that you won’t enjoy working for
-	Job hunting is very much a full time gig so if you’re career-changing I’d recommend the seemingly risky option of quitting (for a reason) and focus on projects and the job hunt. You’ll get a job by searching part-time, but it may take longer and it will be more tiring
-	Quitting for a reason: finding a course you’re going, a local tech for good project you’re helping to upgrade, or building an idea you’ve had for some time.

ennalax,"Some background: I’m an iOS developer and interviewer for the company I work at. 

**Stop waiting to be contacted ** 

You need to be proactive, especially if you have no experience in the field. Unless you’re fresh out of college and studied computer science and did some amazing things there and your professors are sending a good word about you to companies they keep ties to (or don’t mind waiting for a while) look for a job yourself. Instead of looking for recruiters search on LinkedIn, Monster, Indeed and Xing yourself (or any other site that is used in your region). Every recruiter’s time is limited and since they are usually rewarded for successful hires they would focus on candidates with experience with a straightforward career path, that would take less time to understand who they are - all so they can later “sell them” easier as the right candidate for the job.  

** Be the right candidate **

Make sure to show in your CV that you are interested in the position you’re applying for.  A usual graduate I’ve interviewed successfully usually has at least a project or two they tried on their own (either published to the AppStore or in a public repo on GitHub). Also be ready to show that you’re proactive and a fast and independent learner. Nobody wants to hire a grad that they will have to train 24/7. Instead you are expected to show that all you need is a direction and that you are not afraid to dig in the documentation yourself to find an answer. If you’re also switching from a different profession you also need to mention why you did that and show a genuine interest in the position you’re targeting.  

** Look for the right position **

Since you are looking for an entry level position you should always look for the term “graduate” in the title or first line of description in the jobs you’re looking at.  Junior (at least in Europe, and in the US when I was starting some 12 years ago) assumes that you have at least a year of professional experience and you’re able to do your daily work without lots of questions.

Also instead of helpers, a lot of people usually use extensions now. So instead of having a LocalizedFormatterHelper, you extend Double with secondsToLocalizedString and metersToLocalizedString calculated properties.

eddieSullivan,"From a practical standpoint, if you don't change anything, it doesn't matter. A class with only static members is essentially a namespace. Either way, you're basically dealing with global variables, for better or worse.

When it might matter in the future is if you decide to support multiple Core Data contexts. Granted, this is not a common scenario, but you might want separate datastores for different types of data, or you might want to implement some of the functionality in a separate framework with its own Core Data stack.

You might also want to do some core data processing on a background thread using a child context.

Anyway, all that's a long way of saying that you might want more than one instance of `CoreDataHelper`, so in that case you would want to have it as neither a singleton nor a namespace, but as a full-fledged instantiatable class. Then you can just make one of them if you only want one, or make multiple if that is the case.

Making it a ""real"" class also encourages good practices such as dependency injection and makes it easier to mock the class for testing purposes.

lucasvandongen,"I think state and UI make things a lot more complex than Swift itself if you come from a back-end developer where every problem is basically one big function that gets an HTTP Request and returns an HTTP Response. HTTP is stateless and has no UI of it's own.

So the most logical thing to do if you say you want to learn Swift is making an API in Swift first (I hear people rave about Vapor) where you can repeat your tried and tested knowledge about back-ends while learning Swift in a fairly stateless environment. Write some Integration Tests in Swift if you can to test it.

If you have that back-end ready in Swift you know how to write Swift and you can get dirty with the App itself. I think it might be smart to again start writing network code, so you implement the Model part where specialized URLRequests fetch Models of a certain kind from your freshly built API, built TDD with integration tests. Bonus points if you do the parsing towards Model structs in a Generic way.

Now you have a back-end, an app that boots and displays absolutely nothing but can get and store all of the data you need. You know how to write tests and how to write Swift code. That was the easy part.

Now you need to tame the UI and State. The UI is going to be hard, State too. I would advise to use XIB's that you can instantiate through an `init` so you can simply pass in all of the data it needs (like a Player struct when you show PlayerViewController) but you still have the immediate visual feedback that comes with Interface Builder.

Don't dive into all kinds of patterns and yada, use your common sense. Learning vanilla MVC first is the best. There are a few rules:

* No network code in ViewControllers (but you already wrote beautiful separated Model code by now)
* No View code in ViewControllers, unless it's `isHidden`. Just specialize your Views and give them functions like `func display(player: Player)` or `func animateIntro()`. A ViewController doesn't care about colors, animations or sizes. A View can have @IBOutlets to other views as well so they can manage their own part of the visual tree.
* Really the ViewController should be just somebody that delegates _all_ of the real work to other classes. No form checking, no parsing, no nothing. Just logic like ""ah you want to submit this form I see....let the `FormChecker` check the input, then let it return a `PlayerFormData` struct or an error in case of success I'll have the `PlayerSaveRequest` send that form data to the endpoint.""

You have a background in programming so I'd start with the basics of Swift and keep things simple.  Don't get involved in extensions, enum, etc... just do the basic Swift stuff and make that work.

One of the problems with ""knowing Swift"" is that you can learn a LOT of stuff and some of that you may never use.  There's a lot of stuff in Swift that are to make things easier to read, less code, etc...  I'd stay away from that until you are good with the basics.

I then dig into the APIs and start doing more complex tutorials.

Give us some idea of the kinds of errors you're getting and we can help you get past those.  Also, the types of tutorials make a big difference.  I get sick of watching other people type, I wish they would make the tutorials NOT about typing and just highlight the code and explain what it does.  I found the ""set"" of tutorials from Udemy to be pretty good.  Angela Yu and Ray W have some from late last year on Swift 4 that are really good.  They always go on sale for around $10.  I'd run thru those.",1527151371.0

jasamer,"You should read the docs so you know what you're doing. You'll see that the code you're trying to compile isn't quite up to date (it's for an older swift version and requires fixing).

So how do you fix it?

Let's take `let paths = (NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(.DocumentDirectory, .UserDomainMask, true)[0] as NSString).stringByAppendingPathComponent()` as an example. It does not compile. So let's look up the parts. 

First, `NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains`. Google it, you'll find https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/1414224-nssearchpathfordirectoriesindoma. It still takes three arguments, so at least that part is correct. Let's look at the first one parameter, `_ directory: FileManager.SearchPathDirectory`. Note that the last part is a link. When you click it, you get more infos on it. Your original code uses `.DocumentDirectory` (short hand for `SearchPathDirectory.DocumentDirectory`. Is that in the list? No, but `documentDirectory` (lowercase!) is. So it looks like you have to use the lower-case version.

Do the same thing for `UserDomainMask` - look up the docs (it's also lower-case now, like all enums). Look up `stringByAppendingPathComponent` (just google it). You'll see that it's called `appendingPathComponent` now, and it takes an argument: the path component that you want to append. So fix that as well.

That should be all for this line, try to figure out the other problems yourself.",1527164740.0

These aren't new, I've seen things like ""hiring plumbers"" and you think it's a company offering a job, but it's a company offering training for a job.

They could be offering interviews with other companies after the training and them maybe you owe them 20K over the next year from the pay at the job they help you get.

The scam part is if they don't tell you what they are offering.  IF it's a school offering training and job searches after the training, that's one thing... if it's a paying job from day one, that's another thing.

The real issue is when do you get paid.  Even that could be wrapped up in a scam as they could pay you out of your tuition loan.  So they loan you 20k, they pay you 10K and you owe 20 or 30K \(plus interest\) once you sign on and you use the next job to pay them back.

KarlJay001,"When I started iOS, it was probably my 4th platform and I approached it the same way I did the others.

I make a bunch of small programs in order to understand how various things work, then I work towards larger, more complex programs.

There's a good reason for this.  Let's say that you know how to store data to a plist and you then jump into a pretty complex app and you use plist to store your data...  Your project would have been better off with Core Data or Realm, but you've now spent a bunch of time with plist trying to make it work.

Same with TableView vs CollectionView, and the use of a StackView.  Some say there's little reason to ever use a TableView over a CollectionView.  Some use StackView to handle UI changes, etc...

Digging into these things before you get into a large project is a good thing.  If you're looking for a job and you show up with a large project, someone might say ""why didn't you use X"" ...  It makes it look like you've wasted time using the wrong tool.

Real world example:  I was looking for a data entry screen that would handle more field that would fit on the screen.  I started making a UIScrollView and then routines to handle when the keyboard would cover the text field and other problems.

I then trashed the whole thing and used a UITableView to handle all these issues.  It worked great.

thisischemistry,"Why are you doing both

    var topLabel = SKLabelNode()

You're creating an `SKLabelNode`, throwing it out, then trying to load another one, failing, and ignoring the failure while you try to cast it to a SKLabelNode.

Do you ever set a child node with the name ""topLabel""? I don't see that happening anywhere in your code. Are you setting it externally? If so, you should properly test for it before you attempt to use it. 

You would set a child node with [`addChild(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sknode/1483054-addchild) or through the [scene editor](https://www.raywenderlich.com/118225/introduction-sprite-kit-scene-editor) and later obtain it with [`childNode(withName:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sknode/1483060-childnode) which returns a `SKNode?`. Your code should look like:

    var topLabel: SKLabelNode?
    var bottomLabel: SKLabelNode?

    override func didMove(to view: SKView) {
        guard topLabel = self.childNode(withName: ""topLabel"") as? SKLabelNode else { return }
        guard bottomLabel = self.childNode(withName: ""bottomLabel"") as? SKLabelNode else { return }
        // ...
        startGame()
    }

Granted for places where they it makes sense like interacting with the app store, in app purchases, notifications, etc they use system APIs, but for things like graphics and gameplay they use either a gaming framework (aka an engine) or custom write one.

In that type of situation you will largely use whatever the framework is designed for. For one of the major frameworks, Unity, that is C#. There is no inherit reason that I know of that you couldn't write a gaming engine such that it uses Swift but the language is also new enough that I don't think any of the major gaming frameworks use it as a first class language.

An app like tinder or snapchat could theoretically be written in 90% swift. In apps like that though there are generally weird little edge cases where you end up dropping down to something lower. Maybe Obj-C, C, or C++. Hard to say for sure without actually being involved in the actual project.

Also, about the nil error. I believe it's because you're calling `configureSlider()` when textSlider is set, and inside that function, you're using `textView`.

XAleXOwnZX,"`super` is a special keyword, just like `self`. It's a common misconception that it ""refers to the super class"". It doesn't.

Notice, for one, that instance methods can be called on `super`. That's odd, isn't it? You can't call instance methods without an instance.

`super` is actually a reference to `self`, but with special behaviour. When you call an instance method on `self`, the class of `self` is accessed, and the desired instance method's implementation is looked up from that table. Then, the implementation is called, with the arguments being passed, one of which is self.

`let result = self.instanceMethod(string: ""String"", int: 123)` behaves kind of like:
    let methodTable = self.class.methodTable
    let instanceMethodImplementation = methodTable[""instanceMethod(string:int:)""] as! ((Class) -> (string: String, int: Int) -> Result)
    let boundInstanceMethod = instanceMethodImplementation(self)
    let result = boundInstanceMethod(string: ""String"", int: 123)

Calling an instance method on `super`, on the other hand, is still calling an instance method that operates on `self`, but it changes where the method implementation is retrieved from. Instead of looking it up from `self.class`'s table, it comes from the superclass table:

    let methodTable = self.class.superclass.methodTable // This is different. Everything else is the same.
    let instanceMethodImplementation = methodTable[""instanceMethod(string:int:)""] as! ((SuperClass) -> (string: String, int: Int) -> Result)
    let boundInstanceMethod = instanceMethodImplementation(self)
    let result = boundInstanceMethod(string: ""String"", int: 123)",1527027598.0

 - There goes any chance I had of ever learning *all* of Swift (and I've been programming for decades, and know dozens of languages).  They're adding a ton of complexity here -- and continue to add it faster than I can become good at everything they added before.  I really don't know how they can claim with a straight face that this is a good language for beginners.
 - Also, I suspect, there goes any chance of the compiler performance or crashing situation improving.  It's already probably the most complex language I've ever used, and this is a huge increment.  I doubt there's ever going to be an independent implementation.
 - Is it expected that people will memorize the `@compilerEvaluable` subset, or just try things and see if it works?  The Swift way seems to be the latter (e.g., when is an expression too complex), which makes me sad.
 - Paul Graham continues to be right about programming language development consisting of taking an idea from Lisp and throwing it at C.
 - Is it worth it, to be able to check alignment at compile-time?  I'm not seeing a benefit consummate with the cost.  It seems to be mostly pushed by TensorFlow, but that's only mentioned briefly and I'm not entirely clear on how or why they need it.  Apple engineers have already pushed back on areas where Swift is simply not a good match (e.g., protobufs with Codable), yet in this case they seem willing to drastically change the language to meet entirely new requirements.

I’d like to know how one can have a development process that allows this to work out. I’m interested to hear about that.
I try my best to always keep the code as neat and complete as possible. Especially the parts where various parts of the system interact. In more isolated parts you can be more relaxed. Before adding new features or doing major restructuring I always try to make sure everything is as clean as possible. Keep naming correct etc. No hidden complexities or known bugs etc. I add features in very small incremental steps, often with a lot of refactoring in between to keep chances small and comprehensible and meaningful. I make sure that everything stays clean and working as its own thing before changing or adding anything.
If you try to build new shitty stuff on top of shitty foundations the complexity of the whole thing can easily grow exponentially and things can easily get out of hand. And you need to go back or tidy things up to get it into a comprehensible state.
I have never seen any app or framework that ended up great based on shitty code added to shitty code and then “fixed” later. Of course one can improve shitty code, but only in incremental clean steps anyway. In my experience you end up with a great end result only when your project “hygiene” is great all around.

thisischemistry,"I don't think there's really a best practice on this, just be consistent.

Remember that you already get module-level namespacing for free. If your module is named ""FooLibrary"" and some other module is named ""BarLibrary"" and you both have an `Error` type you can do this to access each uniquely:

    let myError = FooLibrary.Error()
    let theirError = BarLibrary.Error()

And within each module it defaults to its own namespacing, so inside `FooLibrary` if you do the following you get the type that's defined in that library:

    let myError = Error() // actually FooLibrary.Error()

At this point all you are looking for is an easy way to get a clear, concise type that can be glanced at and informs you as to what's going on. Is it easier to read `Class.Error.SpecificError` vs `Error.Class.SpecificError`? I think the latter is better at a glance, it groups all the errors visually since that's the first part of the namespace. Then you can get specific as to what type of error it is, what class, what the error means.

Here's an example of how you can easily group and add new errors:

    // Library-level errors

What does really matter is the way you learn it, and so, if you can keep up enought motivation to dig a bit more.

With this on your mind, try to choose something that will attack handicaps without blink:

- Something that will not be a pain in the ass to setup or mantain in any system/OS, and you can run it everywhere while you reach the core basics of the programming world.

- Realistic and scalable goals: does fit with your taste build a simple text game for a computer or a exams agenda? ask yourself what type of content will lead you to keep on the wave while learning.

eddieSullivan,"This is an interesting question. While I personally enjoy working in Swift, I would not recommend Swift for a beginner programming course, and here's my reasoning:

**Tooling**

You're pretty much limited to XCode, which is one of the worst IDEs out there. Autocomplete often stops working, it frequently crashes, and it doesn't have a great user interface. Furthermore, it only runs on Mac.

The compiler is also new and bug prone. It can crash without telling you why. Also, it often spits out error messages that are hard to understand and sometimes flat-out wrong. It can be very off-putting for a student to have to wrestle with the tools rather than the actual concepts he or she is suppose to be learning.

**Complexity**

Swift is a very complex language, with type inference, product-types, pattern matching, closures, generics, and operator overloading. Yes, you can mitigate that somewhat by teaching just the essentials, but it makes the documentation that much harder to get through.

ARC could be a topic for a whole course itself. Explaining the need for weak reference types to beginner students could be quite a challenge.

**Cocoa and Cocoa Touch**

The Apple APIs you need to use for iOS programming are not the cleanest. While they've come a long way, there are still some strange interactions with the old Objective C way of doing things.

You say ""my school"" but we don't know if this is a college, HS, or JHS.  I'm guessing it's a HS and there's no way to know what background people have or what other classes that are offered.

If you already have a class that does ""intro to programming"" then having an ""intro to iOS programming using Swift or intro to Swift"" would be great.

sunflowerfly,Apple has released curriculum for both k-12 and college. Free,1526691015.0
applishish,"I wouldn't recommend Swift for a first language, especially at the high school level.

 - It's basically still Apple-only.  Its primary use is Mac and iOS apps, which is going to disinterest a lot of people (half the class won't be able to play with it at home).  It's possible to run it on Linux but every week there's people coming in here asking why something doesn't work right and why it's so hard to set up.  For learning programming, you don't want to go platform-specific.
 - It's very complex.  Its syntax is about as complex as C++, except it also has type inference.  It can look visually simple, if you know what you're doing, but just because there's not many characters on screen doesn't mean it's actually simple to understand.
 - It's still very young.  It's only a couple years old, and it's just starting to stabilize.  You don't want to have to worry about the version of some sample code you find online, or which package manager is popular this month.  Or worse, the intersection of these: finding a library which works with your version of Swift *and* the package manager you're using.

I've tried teaching and learning in each of these scenarios before.  All of them at the same time?  That definitely adds up to ""not a great first programming experience"".

Some people here have mentioned Python.  That's a good first programming language.  It's cross-platform, has much simpler syntax, and is old enough that it's fairly stable.  Pick a recent version, like Python 3.5.  There were some major changes at 3.0, and in the early 3.x's, but by 3.5 it settled down nicely.

If Python isn't your thing, there are lots of other languages which can make good first languages:

 - Ruby (not entirely unlike Python)
 - Java (a bit verbose but not too bad)
 - C# (good cross-platform support these days)
 - C++ (if you have a teacher who can pick a reasonable subset)
 - Matlab/Octave (often used by engineers who aren't otherwise programmers -- maybe you could pair it with a science course)
 - Haskell, Scheme, Lua, Tcl, Forth (less conventional but they have the advantage of actually being as simple as they look)
 - plenty of other languages I don't know or remember right now...

The most important thing is to find a good teacher.  Any language with a good teacher who understands the language can work just fine (even assembly language!).  Any language with a teacher who doesn't know programming, or doesn't know the language, will be a disaster.

1. Unity 3D or Blender for Games and some graphics apps \(Uses C# or JavaScript\)
2. PHP, Python or Ruby for web apps

            get { return withUnsafeBytes { (bytePtr:UnsafePointer<T>) in return (bytePtr + index).pointee } }
        }
    }

then you can do let someNumber:Int32 = data[5] to get the 5th Int32, and so on. It’s not totally clear to me whether you’d actually want “the 5th Int32” or “the Int32 at byte offset 5” though. I guess you could use subscript label arguments and have both:

    data[byte: 5] = Int32(10)
    data[elementOffset: 5] = Int32(10)

Aeather,"1. Your extension use is fine. I would recommend splitting it up into CellFontSizeDecreaseDelegate, CellFontSizeIncreaseDelegate to enable reuse if you ever needed to.
2. You are using the extension incorrectly in `let fontText = UITextView.increaseFontSize() and let fontText = UITextView.decreaseFontSize()` You are calling these functions on a UITextView, which if you take a step back and ask yourself. What is it decreasing, and what is it increasing? How does the system know WHICH UITextView you want to decrease or increase. The extension allows you to call methods on objects of that type. An object meaning an outlet or anything of UITextView type. So lets say you create a UITextView and create an outlet in your viewcontroller from your Interface builder. You name it NameTextView. In your viewcontroller it would be `@IBOutlet weak var NameTextView : UITextView!.` Once you have declared this, since it's a type of UITextView, you would be able to call NameTextView.increaseFontSize\(\) because you have extended that type with a function that you created. So if you wanted to increase the font size of the textLabel inside your cell. You would want to extend the UILabel object and create a method that will increase it's size, or decrease and you could call it like `cell.textLabel.increaseSize()` In your viewcontroller.

KarlJay001,"\>A quick search on a job board reveals that there are not many openings for Native iOS development.

Where did you do your search?  I've just checked 1 single zip code and there are thousands for iOS dev jobs open right now.  Some 2,100...  over the past few years that number was usually 1,200 to 1,400.

Not a very scientific method.  Mobile is different.  Part of the difference is that it's a whole different platform and ""old code"" doesn't transfer very well.

IMO, we're entering a new stage that has split things up a bit.  At the start, being an indie dev was the gold rush.  Then it became flooded and getting a native mobile job was the new gold rush.  Now you have ""old code"" from a few years back that needs to be upgraded/maintained.

Back in the day, the jobs were mainly upgrading and maintaining old code.  iOS dev didn't have old code, now it does.

Another issue is mobile enterprise apps.  These are the new area for growth.  Mobile enterprise are apps that would have been PC, client\-server apps of yesteryear that are now going mobile.  Mobile enterprise is not just Silicon Valley, it includes department stores all over the world.  Companies that have sales staff that are moving PC apps to their smart phones.  There's also ones like Salesforce where they are moving deeper and deeper into mobile.

All kinds of jobs in mobile and not all are full mobile.  Sometimes it's a combo job.  A job where the programmer  does server work, front end work and works on the companies mobile app.  Not all mobile projects require a full time programmer.

There's also contract work, the one's that don't need full time programmers can be better filled with a contract worker and those don't always show up on a job board.

I finally got around to testing that and both my hypotheses were correct.  The “naive” benchmark code is spending more than half its runtime on bookkeeping.  The Swift Algorithms Club  implementation with a recursive enum performs similarly.  The code here lays out frames that allocate twice along their entry points and deallocate along the exits.  So the benchmark is functionally a test of malloc under stochastic loads - and it behaves as such (poorly). 

I suspect the dynlangs are performant because they are using allocator pools and optimize the loop pretty quickly. Rust and C++ (at least, the not refcount ones) is probably performing better because they try to TCO calls like this (IIRC) and it must be working.",1526443800.0

lolcoderer,"The problem here is that these rules won't catch 90% of of the bugs I come across daily. 

Rule #2 from the article states: ""No Networking""

With most modern applications, connecting to a network / cloud API is paramount. Networking also introduces difficult issues like concurrency, asynchronous I/O, etc...Which is frankly, where most of my modern day bugs originate... If TDD can't test these things, then TDD is worthless to my workflow.

Here is a concrete example that I recently encountered (please feel free to enlighten me how TDD could have helped me in this situation).... 

API definition stated that there was a parameter in the API (json) response of an API call - lets call this property ""year"". The API defined this as:
    
    {
         ""year"": ""2018""
    }

My json processing (using the awesome Swift 4 Codable JSONDecoder) was working fine until a server upgrade and all of a sudden the year was being returned as an Int - and the entire decoding step failed - and the result was a broken app experience. The upgraded server was returning:

    ""year"": 2018

You would never be able to catch this kind of error if you obey rule #2.

Some other examples of recent issues I have encountered:

DispatchGroup not ever completing because of network timeout issues

Imbalance of DispatchGroup.enter() & DispatchGroup.leave() calls due to bug in handling of parsing network results.

The point is... Ignoring the networking component of your app is ignoring 90% (totally made up number) of most modern iOS/tvOS/macOS applications. 

Maybe I am misunderstanding the purpose of TDD - maybe I am suppose to create a stub for every API call permutation (not gonna waste my time -as this obviously begins to approach infinity). 

But I seriously am not sure how to integrate TDD into a modern, and complex network based application.

rkennedy12,"Here is my take that doesn’t directly answer your question but might be a good place to begin for discussing the topic with a business since it directly relates to manhours and thus money which is what management will care most about.

The migration from swift 2 to swift 3+ is pretty challenging. A lot (and I mean **A LOT**) was changed between 2 and 3. I’m not talking about just added features of the language and some short hand aids but a ton changed in terms of syntax. What does this mean? It means that it’s going to take you a lot of time to migrate the project. Is that necessarily a bad thing? No.

Migrating the project, although tedious and relatively mundane, gives you the chance to really look over the code, line-by-line, and find inefficiencies or even those pesky bugs that may still be slipping through the cracks. The migration assistant also helps quite a bit by keeping you focused on the areas that really changed a lot whether it be in syntax or whatever. 

So with all this work for so little payback why migrate?

Although the journey from version 2 to version 3 (or in this case 4) is quite extensive and painful, the code is a lot easier in terms of readability and interpretation. This will help in the long run as your coders will become a little more efficient and be able to cover more ground in the same time once they learn the syntax changes. Also, the performance is a little bit better so you may see the end user have a better experience. You may even find a benefit by having newer versions of Xcode and newer code bases that the builds don’t take nearly as long! Finally, the changes from version 3 to version 4 weren’t nearly as bad and migration assistant was able to cover a lot more of the jumps by itself. This has continued on as the language gets more and more mature so I’m guessing the changes from 4 to 5 will be even less of a task. 

Taking these small recesses and updating the code base is just going to make it easier to move forward with minimal wasted time in the future because who knows migration assistant may not cover the jump from 2.3 to 5+ without failure. Then you are really gonna be kicking yourself in the ass. 

Another added point is they will definitely wanna update in the future as the language becomes ABI stable so you better get working on it.

Also no, migration to Swift 3 is sufficient. Regardless, you will have to move to using Xcode 9 and therefore at least Swift 3, and the step from 3 to 4 is small and painless, so I'd recommend to move to 4 while you're at it.

>Is there an actual way to test on a physical iPhone X since their minimum OS is 10, with an app in Swift 2.3?

No.

Basically, your issue boils down to the fact that if you don't migrate to Xcode 9 and Swift 3 or 4 soon, you'll be unable to publish updates to your app. Since the migration from 2 to 3 can really be a PITA and will entail loads of testing even after you have everything compiling, I'd strongly recommend moving rather sooner than later.",1526037399.0

> One powerful feature of Swift is its ability to extend protocols – to be able to add new functionality not only to one type, but to a whole collection of types that all conform to the same protocol.

> Protocol-oriented programming takes that feature and encourages you to craft your app’s architecture around it so that the first thing you do is sketch out one or more protocols rather than get straight into concrete types. 

> If you’re coming from a more traditional object-oriented system where inheritance is more common, try to think as your first protocol as being a base class. You can then create new protocols by inheriting from that initial protocol, and write extensions so they have default implementations. 

> However, a better approach is to write lots of small protocols that each do specific, individual things: one to make products purchasable, one to make them serializable, one to make them searchable, and so on. You can then add default implementations to those extensions, which means you can add functionality to existing types just by making them conform to your protocol.

> In this respect protocol-oriented programming is sort of a similar approach to multiple inheritance from languages such as C++. However, because protocol extensions can’t include state you don’t get any of the cruft, and Swift’s constraint-based conflict resolution is easy enough for everyone to understand.

If you haven't used protocol extensions before, I have [an article on that too](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-are-protocol-extensions). 

For specific examples of POP in action, I made a video called [Natural Swift](https://gumroad.com/l/natural-swift). It's free to download, and teaches POP as part of three technologies – the other two are value types and functional programming.",1525984838.0
ducusheKlihE,You should watch this talk from the WWDC 2015: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/,1526028175.0
Cyberbeni,"What the other guy described is not POP, it's basically multiple inheritance with protocol extensions since swift only allows you to inherit from 1 class.

POP is when you have a task that can be done multiple ways and you make an interface over all the implementations and use it the same way, no matter which implementation you are using.

Example:

you want to send notification to the user. For system notifications, you have to ask for permission first. So your NotificationManager protocol will have both ""askPermission"" and ""send"" functions no matter if one of it's implementation has an empty askPermission function because it only pops up some alerts as a way of notifying the user and you don't need any extra permission for that.

Now when you want to change your class to also send system notifications, all you have to do is to modify the dependency injection for that class since it's already trying to ask for permission.

edit:

You also don't want to overuse conforming to multiple protocols that have default implementations. Staying with my previous example, you could have the implementations as other protocols that are inheriting from your base protocol. But that doesn't allow you to decide which one you want to use runtime, you have to decide it before building the app. And it also makes it seem like your class is responsible for all that stuff when in reality, you are just conforming to a protocol, so you will have to call self.send instead of self.notificationManager.send which can become a problem if you have a bunch of other stuff that might have ""send"" functions and also makes your code less readable without mousing over the send function to see that it belongs to the NotificationManager protocol that you are conforming to.",1526020005.0

Classes however often are more complex and hide their implementation and therefore you
might want to init only some fields via constructor while others might be internally initialized.
Inheritance could also get complicated very fast if there was a memberwise constructor for classes.

> The default memberwise initializer behavior of Swift has at least these deficiencies (IMO):
>
> 1. Defining a custom init in a struct disables the memberwise initializer, and there is no easy way to get it back.
> 2. Access control + the memberwise init often requires you to implement it yourself.
> 3. We don’t get memberwise inits for classes.
> 4. var properties with default initializers should have their parameter to the synthesized initializer defaulted.

**Everything about Interviews**

* [Interview Types](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/software-engineering-interviews-744380f4f2af) by Andyy Hope 
Andyy is the guy, who made Playgrounds conference. He finished seven on-site interviews at Silicon Valley tech companies. Ultimately he accepted an offer for a software engineering job at Facebook. Here’s how Andyy prepared for these interviews, and what he learned along the way. 

* [iOS Interview Questions](https://github.com/MaximAbramchuck/awesome-interview-questions#ios)
It’s an amazing GitHub repository with all possible interview questions and answers for iOS position. You’ll find there 13 articles with dozens of interview questions. Super useful for preparation! 

* Initial phone and tech screens by Sean Allen 
Sean discusses phone & tech screens for an iOS engineer position and shares how those went for him. Interesting to learn on a real-life example ways to win such interviews. 


**Where to find iOS jobs**

Look for good iOS development openings at these sites: 

* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?q=ios) has around 100 iOS jobs.

* [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/q-iOS-developer-jobs.html) proposes 500+ jobs.

* [iOS Dev Jobs](https://iosjobs.io/?flawlessappnewsletter) can propose you 30+ positions.

* Check iOS offers at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/ios-developer-jobs/) by specifying role and country.

* For freelance tasks or short-term projects go to Upwork, Freelancer, Fiverr, Toptal.

* If you're brave enough for joining a startup, then browse AngelList or Product Hunt jobs.

nullnox,"Call it when you want a prompt for review to be presented, such as after the user has performed a certain action, or has had the application for a while.

For example, in my score keeping app I record the time the app was first opened, and only after at least 10 minutes have passed, I call the prompt method when the user clears their score (meaning they are done with a game). I also only show the prompt if the score is lower because the user is more likely to be happier. I also record whether I shown the prompt for the current app version; and reset this when a new version is downloaded.

You should not call it immediately when your app opens. The prompt will appear immediately and users will be annoyed. The API doesn’t queue it up for a later time. The 3 time restriction is meant to prevent users from being bombarded with these prompts.

There is no way to know whether the prompt succeeded for was even shown, since the OS will only show it a maximum 3 times within a year long period. (There is actually is also a setting where users can disable this prompt from showing in all apps.) This is also why you shouldn’t trigger the prompt as the result of the press of a “Rate the app” button.

0hmyscience,"I use this in my app. Basically I say “whenever X happens, request a review”. X is something that probably happens to every user on every session. However, it is iOS who decides whether something happens a or not. 

You also get no errors or return codes, so it isn’t possible (unless you come up with some clever hacks) to know if the review was requested or not. 

For this reason, you should never call it from a button named “leave review”, because most of the time, nothing will happen. 

In my experience, the first time it’s called on each device, it works. So for that reason I tend to “throttle” the call. That means I say something like “if the app was installed less than 3 days ago, don’t request the review”. This gives users some time to use the app before I ask for a review. Asking them for a review the first time they open the app is a sure way to have them dismiss the dialog.

twostraws,"As you have experiences with other languages you shouldn't find Swift too hard to pick up – it really depends on what the other languages were! Try whizzing through the videos in my free [Swift in Sixty Seconds course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty) – each one lasts a minute, so you can get through the whole thing in about 1.5 hours. 

Some tips to get you started:

- Optionals are an important language, feature, but always prefer a non-optional type if possible.

- Throwing functions are better than optional returns. If someone wants an optional return they can convert the throwing function using `try?`.

- Swift developers rely very heavily on value types rather than reference types. In fact, most of our types have value semantics: integers, strings, doubles, bools, arrays, sets, dictionaries, tuples, enums, etc. If you're making custom types that aren't just UIKit subclasses, prefer structs over classes.

- Although I'm not saying you should go full FRP, learning the [elements of functional programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgU8d_E1K14) will help you write better, safer, simpler code.

- Swift is changing very quickly, with important new features being added regularly. I made a whole site to help you keep up to date: [What's new in Swift](https://www.whatsnewinswift.com).

- It's easy to get overwhelmed by the size of major APIs like UIKit, but the truth is that you'll only use a quarter of it – master *that* and you'll be in a great position.

- [The books I write](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store) are pretty good :)   (Start with the original Hacking with Swift book, which is [free to read online](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read).",1525771035.0
thisischemistry,"Something that will save you a ton of headaches is to avoid using the force-unwrap or implicit-unwrap operator, which looks like `!`. (The negation operator, which is also `!`, is ok to use.)

Suppose you have a function that may or may not return a value. Say you're keeping track of how many apples you have on hand but you want to also know if you've never given any away or received any. So you know you want an `Int` but you also want to store the value ""none"", or 0, as different from ""never"". You could store two pieces of information, a `Bool` and an `Int` or you could use an `Optional` - something that either has a value or is `nil`, meaning it has no value.

Here's an example:

    func apples() -> Int? { /* return the count of apples or nil */ }

That's a function that returns an optional `Int`, or `Optional<Int>`. It's an `Int` wrapped up in an `Optional`. You can use it like:

    let count = apples()

Now `count` has the type `Int?`, in order to use it as an `Int` we'll need to unwrap it.  We could force the unwrap by doing:

    let count = apples()!

This is called force-unwrapping and means that `count` will have the type `Int`. But we just threw away a crucial piece of information – what if the return value was `nil`? Then this statement will crash because you're trying to force the compiler to create something from nothing.

We could also do this:

    let count: Int! = apples()

This produces an implicitly-unwrapped `Optional`, which means that although `count` is an `Optional` we never expect its value to be `nil`. So the compiler can later unwrap it for us without testing and we can use it like it was an `Int`. It's a trap though, suppose we aren't 100% certain that the value won't be `nil`? If we later use `count` and it turns out to be `nil` then we'll crash at that later use and it could be messy to debug.

Instead of forcing the unwrap we should do it the right way, by testing it and then using it:

    if apples() != nil { /* we know we've exchanged apples */ }

Now I've checked the result and done something if it comes back without a value. Of course, in this instance I didn't save the value so it disappears. Instead, we can do:

    if let count = apples() { /* we know we've exchanged apples, use the count */ }

By using `if let` (or `if var`) I can test, unwrap, and save the value in one step. Now `count` has a value for the scope following the `if let` statement.

Another valuable statement is:

    guard let count = apples() else { /* never exchanged apples, early exit */ }
    // we know we've exchanged apples
    // continue and use the count

This looks similar to `if let` but the difference is that the scope following the `else` is only executed if `count` would be `nil`. If it's not `nil` then execution continues normally.

A `guard` statement is used as a way to exit early from that enclosing scope . The  scope following the `else` must have an exit statement which will be used to exit the scope enclosing the `guard`. Exit statements are `return`, `break`, `continue`, or `throw`. So when `count` would be `nil` it allows you to exit early without using it.

You can use `guard` just like an `if` statement in other places too, not just for unwrapping `Optional`. The same concepts apply, skip to the `else` and provide an exit statement to exit the enclosing scope.

So these are the basics behind `Optional` values. These kinds of values are a valuable tool and should be used whenever makes sense. They protect your code from operations that might have no valid result but which might not stop execution. For example, converting a `String` into an `Int`. You'll want to know if the operation fails but it's messy to indicate that without using a magic return value, or several return values, or even some sort of side ""error channel"". Using an `Optional` is much cleaner.",1525785085.0

Already half the comments in here are blaming Xcode, but you know what? If you use Xcode for Objective-C development it works well. It's the Swift portion that's broken. (Which is still largely Apple's responsibility, but more on the Swift team.)

Apple built an empire on Objective-C. They can't even build a debugger for Swift.",1525717502.0
applishish,"Ruby is 23 years old.  Swift is 3 years old.  Of course Ruby's tools are going to be about 700% more polished.  Even the very idea of ""known for quite a while"" is radically different between these projects.  Ruby has about almost 1000 known compiler bugs older than that Swift one you ran into.

As you say, Swift was created primarily for writing end-user applications on Apple's platforms.  Server-side Linux support is not really its wheelhouse.  Are you also frustrated that Ruby is lousy at making native Mac applications?  (They've even got a 20 year head start.)  Every language has platforms where it's strong, and platforms where it's not.  As Larry Wall once said:

> Q. Why is this so clumsy?  
> A. The trick is to use [the language's] strengths rather than its weaknesses.

Swift's main use case is replacing Objective-C, which has no repl, no package manager, no first-class Linux support, no inner classes, etc., so almost all of your problems are with features that Swift has acquired in its first 3 years, which its predecessor never did in 30.  It's a shame that these features suck today, but then again, they're entirely new here.  Even Python is almost 30 years old, and I'm *still* reading about [what dang new package manager](https://xkcd.com/1987/) they've switched to this year, so it's not like it's all peaches and cream elsewhere.

All software trains you to avoid its bugs.  Your other favorite languages are full of bugs, too.  Check their bug databases.  It's just that people who have been using them for a while know what the weaknesses are (like ""writing iOS apps"", for Ruby), and know to avoid them.

Swift is a big language, and I'd say it takes at least 6-12 months to really learn what areas to avoid.  Personally, I'd include ""Linux support"" in that.  When you're using a brand new language, on its third-best-supported platform, you're not going to have the most pleasant development experience.  Like any language, Swift is great at some things and terrible at other things.  Pointing out an individual compiler bug isn't really a good indicator of anything because I can do that for literally any language.  This one is at least a compile-time issue which is easy to work around.

SPM was released only last year and doesn't have many users, most of us are still using Carthage/CocoaPods.

I hate to cast stones because I'm certainly no compiler developer and I know there are a lot of challenges involved in getting things right, especially when type inference is involved.

Compare to C#, which took a slow, methodical approach to adding language features over its first few years, but always kept a very solid development environment.

My biggest pet peeve with the compiler is the confusing and often incorrect error messages any time a closure is involved. If I have an error inside a closure, the first thing I do these days is separate it out into a separate function to see what the *real* error is, and not the spurious one the compiler reports.

It's really rare that startups need C++/Rust level performance from the get go for a backend.  Java/Kotlin, C# and golang are usually plenty good enough.

_stfu_donnie,"Couldn’t agree more. SPM is really frustrating for me. Compare SPM’s feature-set to that of NPM or Cargo:

-	no test/dev-only dependencies
-	no custom test frameworks / runners
-	no extensibility
-	no way to resolve dependencies that results in a reliable, repeatable pattern for the file system, which hampers community involvement and ability to build on top of Swift tooling
-	clumsy / unreadable test reporting output (XCTest in general isn’t very good)
-	no easy upgrade path outside the language release process itself
-	because it uses solely git and git tags, “umbrella” projects are difficult to manage

The devs are... nice? But I haven’t really been encouraged by the direction they’re taking with the project and it feels like it’s a poorly-managed project. I’ve tried to get into the code to add some features, it’s kinda hard to follow with oddly named things and a major overuse of extensions.

They should nuke it and start over, simplify the package spec, and make it specify sources only — then provide a build tool API to let projects decide how to build themselves instead of every dependency trying to define/configure their own builds across many platforms. I even hacked a prototype out using NPM as the code-sharing mechanism. This is what I mean when I say SwiftPM does too much (or tries to), and therefore, it doesn’t do enough.

,"My outsider impression is that the Swift team wrote itself into a corner by attempting to integrate many ambitious features. Marvel said that Infinity Wars was the most ambitious crossover in history, but seriously:

* Modules
* Generics
* Compiled ahead-of-time
* Library-defined operators (not just operator overloading)
* Complex type inference
* Resilience to non-subtractive changes (like how you can add fields to a struct in your library without having to rebuild programs that link against it)
* Extensions and conditional conformance

Some of these features are extremely unusual to find together (if heard of at all). I think that the Swift team took a larger bite than they could easily swallow, and everything is taking a hit as a result. The team might not have predicted that they'd have to have all hands on compiler internals for so long.

- Something called ""Helper"" is a often a little vague of a name. In the case of `AQIHelper`, it is essentially a formatter. So you could name it `AQIFormatter` (or `AirQualityIndexFormatter`). You could have a ""short"" and a ""long"" formatting option, then you could just use the standard `NSFormatter` API for your AQI values. For example, instead of 


    self.qualityLabel.text = description.0


you could have something like 

         qualityLabel = shortAQIDescriptionFormatter.string(for: aqi)

    // and have this as a property of your controller
    let shortAQIDescriptionFormatter = AQIFormatter(.short)
    
- I like your use of extensions.
- I'd prefer if the `DataService` methods had a completion callback. Right now you call `getAirQuality...`; that, on completion, calls a delegate method. It would be easier if you had `func getAirQualityFromCoordinates(coordinates: CLLocationCoordinate2D, completion: (Int?, String?))`. It's similar to how `URLSession` gives you the results when it's done downloading. 
- Some naming I'd do a little differently, but it's minor. For example, instead of `func getAirQualityFromCoordinates(coordinates: CLLocationCoordinate2D)`, `func getAirQuality(from coordinates: CLLocationCoordinate2D)`. In general though, you do a good job not using weird abbreviations and stuff like that. The variables and methods are well named.
- Something to think about: What happens if your refresh twice, the second time before the first request finishes? There's nothing in your code that guarantees that the results of the latest refresh is displayed. Imagine that you start a refresh, but the connection is bad. Then a second one. It may well happen that the second one finishes before the first one, then you'd display the data from the second one briefly; when the first call finishes, that data will be shown. 
- Instead of digging out the controller from the window in `applicationDidBecomeActive`, you could also register the `UIApplicationDidBecomeActive` directly in the controller, and reload the data there.
- I think it would be better if DataService didn't know about the LocationService (single responsibility and all). In this case, I'd expect the ViewController to be responsible for reloading the data when the user location changes. Also, a component should never set it's own delegate like LocationService does. 

That were more points than I thought haha. Don't be discouraged though, your code looks pretty good in general :-)",1525695373.0

-	`Contants.swift` is unnecessary. You shouldn't put API keys in a Swift file (but create a class which can read the API keys from another file and pass it back). You should put your keys in a *.plist* file, put the *.plist* in your *.gitignore* and in your `AppDelegate.swift`, add a check to enforce that the API keys are set up (using something like `AppConfig.enforceAPIKeysAreSetUp()` which will call `fatalError()` if the keys aren't set up). ​

- `try`

The first one has to be in a `do..catch` structure. When an exception is thrown in the `do` scope it is caught and handled in the `catch` scope. You can catch all exceptions or you can catch only certain ones and let the uncaught ones bubble up to the containing scope.

The second one converts a possible exception into an `Optional` that you can test like every other `Optional`. This is useful if you really don't care what exception was thrown, you're going to abort without a valid value anyways.

The last one completely ignores the exception.

When Apple remove something from the App Store, they don't remotely delete it.  They just stop publishing it.

This is, frankly, ridiculous hand wringing.  Apple isn't taking your freedom to be a developer away.

Also, claims like ""Apple is committing fraud"" and ""Apple is committing extortion"" seem libellous to me.  You're telling people they are in the process of committing criminal acts.

cartoonsmart,"Foot note, some developers have resorted to use iCloud storage as a way to help save their customers past in\-app upgrades. This is really not an acceptable solution, as it assumes a lot. Primarily it assumes the buyer of the removed apps eventually finds their way to consolidated app.  But let's use the hypothetical developer of a bunch of pool table apps.  

* 8\-Ball is a $4.99 \(no in\-app purchases\)
* 9\-Ball is $4.99 \(no in\-app purchases\)
* Snooker is $4.99 \(no in\-app purchases\)

This developer has to close down 2 of the 3 apps. 8\-Ball is the most popular, so the developer will merge into this. Apple allows this developer a 2\-month period after updating 9\-Ball and Snooker to try to save some iCloud data in an app group so if that same user eventually downloads 8\-Ball they can get a free upgrade for Snooker and 9\-Ball. 

This assumes the end\-user opens the app within this grace period. I'm sure all of us have apps we've paid for that we leave uninstalled for storage reasons. Right now I have a baby on the way, so a lot of the early\-reader apps I've paid for aren't installed right now, but I'm fully expecting to re\-install them in a couple years.

So let's look at what the developer is left with for their consolidated app....

1. The end\-user would have to pay the $4.99 to buy the 8\-Ball app to then make use of their free upgrade for Snooker and 9\-Ball. Again this all assumes the end user is made aware that 2 of their paid apps have moved.
2. OR the developer now has to make 8\-Ball a free app, which immediately opens to a screen prompting users to buy 8\-Ball, 9\-Ball or Snooker. For new users this is a bad experience. They find the free app they downloaded does nothing but prompt to pay. Ratings will obviously be poor for this version of the app. And now the developer has lost every paid app.",1525633922.0

applishish,"The more I read about Codable, the more limited it seems.  It's great demoware, but it conflates the data model and serialization formats.

Codable is designed to be general enough that it can support any serialization format, but the serialization format is defined as part of the data model, so if you wanted to support 2 or more formats for the same data, you can't do that.  They brag in the docs that the data model can support both JSON and plists from the same model, and also that you can define custom keys for serialization, but the latter only works if the structure of every format is identical.

One of the most common cases of needing to support multiple formats, of course, is versioning, so if your serialization format ever changes (which it almost certainly will), you're eventually going to need to drop down to writing your own `init(from:)` to sort it out.

Out of all the formats in the world, the only formats which have built-in support are [JSON and plists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSZfUnCK5qk).  You can't use Codable for, say, XML, without writing your own encoder/decoder classes.

And you probably wouldn't want to do that, even if it took no time to write or maintain, because Codable doesn't seem to support any kind of streaming, or even lazy initialization.  That's painful for all serialization formats, but XML documents tend to be big (both in size and complexity) so it's even worse here.

Am I missing the other 90% of the documentation?  It looks like Codable is a solution to make serializing a `struct { String, Int }` one line of code, but as soon as your program encounters the Real World, it's going to run into limitations that are no better than NSCoding.",1525567257.0

Oh, and unless I'm missing something, you never actually save it to the defaults to begin with, so thats problem number 1.

Finally if you think that setting it on an instance in one class, and then creating a brand new WeatherManager in another class gives you the ability to access the stations array, then thats now how classes work. You'll have to use a singleton or store the data somewhere and have the state of WeatherManager rebuilt everytime you want to use it.

I've been using Core Data professionally for years, and my experience is there's no reason to worry about setting up your stack to avoid the UI thread before you need to.

I've worked with some really smart people (way smarter than me) who spent months investigating & implementing different context configurations to address their performance problems when the *actual* problems were far more mundane and fundamental.

There are tons of configuration options:

    [SQL store] – [PSC] – [main context]

The most basic, and where you should start.  Anything else is premature optimization.  You could easily end up getting *worse* performance if you pick a more unique option.

    [SQL store] – [PSC] – [main context] – [temporary main context]

Great for when you have work that you might want to save or abandon.  You make a new main queue context as a child of the *main* main queue context, make your changes in there and either save it or discard it without affecting anything else.  It's a natural extension of the first option, and easy to add if needed.

    [SQL store] – [PSC] – [BG context] – [main context]

This one can be nice because you don't have to block your main thread while your SQL changes get written to disk.  Until you execute a new fetch request while the BG context is saving, and all of a sudden everything locks up for an unfortunate amount of time (I've seen UI lock up for 30+ seconds under this configuration).

    [SQL store] – [PSC] – [main context]
                      \ – [background context]

Great for doing batch work in the background without blocking your main context (mostly).  Not so great if the user can be doing other things which can conflict with the background work.

And there's more and more options, each with pros and cons.  You can have multiple persistent stores, multiple persistent store coordinators, and so on.

Related unsolicited advice:

- **The best strategy for dealing with large datasets: don't.**

    Seriously.  Don't try to load thousands of records from the internet and sync them into your database as the user is working in your app.  Load things on-demand, or in batches.  Paginate your remote data.  Core Data uses ""faults"" as placeholders for data it hasn't fully delivered from the persistent store – you should treat your remote data the same way.

- **Never (ever) use ""parent"" entities.**

    The Core Data editor lets you set one entity as a parent for another, and this is a *very* bad idea 99% of the time.  Parent and child entities all get stored in the same SQLite table, meaning you end up with tons of columns and many null values, which is super bad for SQLite.  I've seen this kill projects.

- **If possible, use an in-memory store**

    Instead of SQLite, you can keep your whole object graph in memory.  Only useful if you can throw out all your data when the app terminates, which is uncommon but not unheard of.  But if you can do this, it will eclipse any other optimization you make.

- **[Turn this on](https://oleb.net/blog/2014/06/core-data-concurrency-debugging/)**.

    Never, ever use Core Data without it.  It blows up when you make a mistake in development, and will get you in the right habits.  Soon enough you won't make any queue concurrency mistakes.

KarlJay001,"### Multi-threaded Core Data vs. Asynchronous Fetching

Setting up a separate context and thread for Core Data allows you to perform any necessary operations \(Fetching, Inserting, Deleting, Modifying\) on your managed objects on a background thread. This will free up your main thread for smooth user interaction. However, even on that background thread, each operation will block the context while it’s being performed.

Kasuist,"You'll want to create another class to help with this. 


Let's say you call it something like `UserAPI` or `UserHelper` or even `Session`. You can have a class function in here that will return your `User`. This can then be called from anywhere in your app. `UserAPI.user()`. Inside this class is where you can do the work to pull a saved user from `UserDefaults`.

This same class could also be used to pull user data from firebase and store it in `UserDefaults` on app launch.

Much preferable to passing the user object around from view controller to view controller. Especially if you're only sending it through so a child-child-child-viewController has access. This becomes a dependency that you don't really need and can get really messy on larger projects. 
",1525183053.0
ssrij,"Here's a simple way to do this:

Make your `User` class conform to `Codable`. You should use a struct instead of a class here, so create a struct named `User` which conforms to `Codable`:

    struct User : Codable {
        var userName: String?
        var userAge: Int?
        
        enum UserCodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
            case name = ""userName""
            case age = ""userAge""
        }
        
        func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
            var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: UserCodingKeys.self)
            try container.encode(userName, forKey: .name)
            try container.encode(userAge, forKey: .age)
        }
    }

Now, you can store details for a single `User` or multiple `User`s:

    var userDetails: [User] = [
        User(userName: ""John"", userAge: 21),
        User(userName: ""Mary"", userAge: 27),
        User(userName: ""Richard"", userAge: 32)
    ]

In order to save this data to `UserDefaults`, do this:

    UserDefaults.standard.set(try? PropertyListEncoder().encode(userDetails), forKey: ""userDetails"")

In order to read this data back, do this:

    if let userDetailsData = UserDefaults.standard.value(forKey: ""userDetails"") as? Data {
        let userDetailsArray = try? PropertyListDecoder().decode(Array<User>.self, from: userDetailsData)
    }

In order to persist this data in memory, you can wrap up the loading/saving code in a Singleton and allow the application to access the data through a shared instance, like:

    class UsersAPI {
        
        static let sharedInstance: UsersAPI = UsersAPI()
        private var userDetails: [User]? = [User]()
        
        private init() {
            loadDataFromUserDefaults()
        }
        
        private func loadDataFromUserDefaults() {
            if let userDetailsData = UserDefaults.standard.value(forKey: ""userDetails"") as? Data {
                userDetails = try? PropertyListDecoder().decode(Array<User>.self, from: userDetailsData)
            }
        }
        
        func getUser(byName userName: String) -> User? {
            return userDetails?.filter { $0.userName == userName }.first
        }
    }

Now, you can get an `User` by simply calling:

    UsersAPI.sharedInstance.getUser(byName: ""John"")

I'm not 100% sure since I've had a developer account for a long time but you *may* need a developer account to build for a device and create an archive.

If you have an archived build, you can distribute up to 100 copies for each device type (iPhone, iPad) that will only load on a subset of device UDIDs.  

If each person sends you their device UDIDs, you can enter them in your developer account's valid devices for a provisioning, make an archive with that provisioning profile and then they will need to install. 

We used to do this by emailing an archived app as an .IPA through email, or by letting internal users download the IPA from an internal web site and then synching the IPA to the user's device through iTunes.  I'm not sure what the process is now.

I'm looking in to it now.  Here are some starting points.

lukevanin,"Stefan Mishook, the guy who says Swift is going to become a niche language, is not wrong.

Swift is already a niche language. It's unlikely to ever replace C, C++, Java, or Python. Swift is good, but it's not enough of an improvement over existing languages to make it worth undoing decades and millions of dollars that companies have invested in those languages. Swift is not objectively faster than C, more versatile than C++, more malleable than Python, more ubiquitous than Java.

Swift might have a chance at becoming the lingua franca, but it would need to do a few things first:

1. Run everywhere, including the browser. JavaScript already has that covered, so the next best thing would by being a great language to develop WebAssembly with. Technically this is possible, but the aesthetics of the developer tools and the environment, such as the package management system, make a big difference. Swift still has a long way to go.

2. Have an IDE that runs everywhere, or at least have toolchain that can be made to run everywhere. That means not having a single, stodgy, broken IDE that only runs on one OS that only runs on hardware from a single manufacturer. Xcode is Swift's Achilles heel. If anything is standing in the way of Swift's wide adoption, it's the dependency on Apple's ecosystem. Understandably Apple relishes locking developers into the platform, but at the same time, this is also restricting Swift's growth potential.

3. Have a great standard runtime library. Swift is built to run on Apple's operating systems. Some of Foundation has been open sourced and ported, but there's a lot that still does not work, and even more that still needs to be done. Compare Swift's libraries with Python or Dart. This can only happen by community contributions, which won't happen until Swift is available to a wide audience of developers, and not just people using an Apple OS to develop for an Apple OS.

There's more to it, such as also having a hackable compiler (meaning one that doesn't take hours to compile), stable ABI (still to come), language interoperability, 

This is not to say that being a niche language is necessarily a bad thing. 

Even if Swift stays confined to Apple's ecosystem there will always be reason to keep using it. Stefan's assumption that Flutter (or something like it) can completely replace Swift is misguided. I think Stefan also underestimates Apple's control over their own platforms. Without changing anything else, Apple could change their policy to ban Flutter from their platform. It would be game over for Flutter and there's nothing Google can do about it. 

On the other hand, even if Flutter lives up to they hype, there will still be reason to keep using Swift. Flutter inevitably needs to use the native system, which means having to write native code, using Objective-C, C, C++, or Swift. I think it's unreasonable to expect Flutter to implement all platform features equally, and sufficiently large hybrid apps will need to have native implementations for some features. 

Flutter, or any other third party framework, will always be a step behind, at least until the platform makers decide to support it. In Apple's case, it makes little sense that they would support a competitor's (Google) framework (Flutter), language (Dart), and design aesthetic (Material), while trying to push their own (Swift).

The only way I see Flutter killing Swift, is if Apple partners with Google to make Flutter a first class citizen on Apple devices. Likewise, Swift's future outside of Apple will only happen by Apple releasing their exclusive ownership of the language.",1525126778.0

Animation Blocks, GCD, or any closure or block that is immediately executed will cause a retain cycle for a very short amount of time (milliseconds).

https://swappa.com/laptops/buy/apple-macbook-pro-2016-13-notouch

Currently the cheapest is 1050 but less than perfect model cosmetically could fit your budget. I use this laptop for work. It's an excellent little machine. Probably worth nothing these are USB-C/Thunderbolt only machines, not USB-A native so keep that in mind for monitor/keyboard/mouse/external drive connectivity.

Or the previous generation (lots of acceptable options under $1000):

https://swappa.com/laptops/buy/apple-macbook-pro-2015-retina-13

Do you have a large monitor currently? Strongly recommend getting a 24 - 27 inch monitor if you can (or two 21"" monitors, may actually be cheaper). Lots of screen space is more important than a 1-2 year age and performance difference in the computer itself (IMO - maybe debateable).

applishish,"First experiences: it's not exactly easy to run.

I installed it, and typed ""periphery"", and it printed the names of sub-commands.  So I tried ""periphery scan"", assuming it would just scan the current directory.  It told me I needed `--workspace` or `--project`.  So I gave it the path to the project, in the current directory.  Then it complained I was missing `--schemes`.  I tried `periphery help scan` to try to learn everything that was required so it wasn't just printing errors forever, but there's nothing that tells me here which flags are required or not.  OK, back to trial-and-error.

Eventually I kept going and found that I need `--project`, `--schemes`, and `--targets` (though I don't know why it can't just use the current directory, the default, or the only one).  Then it complained `error: Scheme 'XXX' does not exist in 'YYY.xcodeproj'`.  I tried the UI name of the scheme, the full path of the scheme file, and the internal hash used, and it still complained the scheme doesn't exist.  Strange.

Eventually I dug through the documentation and found the sentence: ""Important: In order for Periphery to find your schemes, they must be marked as Shared in Xcode's Scheme Manager"".  So the error message was a lie -- it does accept the UI name of a scheme, but it pretends they don't exist if they're not marked ""shared""!

I changed my project to make my app scheme ""shared"", and ran it again.  This time I got some other dang error, and my patience ran out.

The website says it's all about Swift, and it's for ""command line junkies"", and additionally offers ""Xcode integration"", so I figured it would be a plain source analyzer, but it's *really* Xcode-dependent.  If you don't have an Xcode project/workspace set up like it expects, it simply won't run at all.  I assume that despite Linux being officially supported by Swift, this won't work there at all, either.

I tried it out as a curiosity, as I can't imagine I have much (if any) code which is simply unused.  Is this a problem that many programmers face?  I'd be curious to hear from others: if you could get Periphery to run, how much dead code does it actually find in your programs?

omparay,"Hi Jaspar,

Note the following:

1. Is your app doing something that differentiates itself from the other apps that perform similar functions:
   1. Is your app limited to a subset of functions that other apps are already providing?
   2. Is it providing the exact same functions as other apps or does it do something unique that distinguishes itself?
   3. Is it providing a function that nobody else has thought of to do in a particular way?
2. Is your app presenting information succinctly:
   1. Is it easy to figure out from a glance and without reading any instructions?
   2. Does it require people to have any experience with other similar apps?
      1. I myself know a lot about programming but I know nothing with regards to Elo \(I had to look it up\). Only after I had read about Elo did I finally start relating to some of your screenshots and the description of your app. THAT is a problem. Your app should present enough to get me by without me having to look up how something is supposed to work.

      1. Your immediate reward is the ""coolness"" of making something that makes you feel proud of yourself.
   2. For every ""Yes"" on your app was there at least several ""No""? Did you reflect before doing something? On wether or not its been done before, and wether or not you were doing something new and exciting?

Yes, but so?  Hanenberg's 2010 paper found (among other things) that programmers spent less time fixing their bugs in dynamically typed languages than they did placating the type checker in statically typed languages -- and the end results were just as good.

It's true you've moved the issue from run-time to compile-time, but doing so neither increased reliability, nor decreased development time.

At least Swift's type system has a purpose: it's designed to allow the compiler to generate fast executables.  This library is pursuing type safety simply for the sake of type safety.",1524497415.0

0hmyscience,"I'm a bit confused since you say you're not looking to support iPad but then you're asking questions. I'll assume you mean you do want to support iPad.

There are several approaches, IMO that you can take, and which one you take will depend of the type of app you have. One of the things you could do is use a split view controller. I believe the Settings app, the Mail app and the Messages app all use these. Basically if you have a navigation controller in your app, the split view controller would have the root view controller on the left, and the rest of the stack on the right. It also has some automatic behaviors when the iPad is rotated. See more in the [UISplitViewController documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisplitviewcontroller).

Another approach, which is a bit more involved is using Auto Layout and Size Classes. The use of these allows you to lay your view out differently depending on the size of the screen.

ewmailing,"As somebody who has worked in cross-platform commercial game engines and needed to care deeply about performance, as a general rule of thumb, we avoid the JVM as much as possible.

Standard disclaimers, when you talk about real world performance for your app, you need to understand what's really going on and what your real bottlenecks are. For example, it won't matter a damn if your CPU code runs 100x faster on one platform vs. another if your application is completely bottlenecked doing I/O. (And I/O in high performance situations can even mean something taken for granted like reading from RAM, meaning L1/L2 cache misses means you stall hundreds of CPU cycles to read a few bytes from RAM from main memory.)

Disclaimers aside, the JVM is painful because garbage collection is very unpredictable. Garbage collection is a complex topic, but at the end of the day, if you care about low latency, you are usually better off avoiding it entirely.

Additionally, there are multiple implementations of the JVM. The Sun/Oracle implementation is highly optimized compared to Android. Android uses their own written from scratch and in my experience has a lot of performance pitfalls. Some of this was necessary because there is far less RAM on mobile devices, but there are a lot of other issues as a consequence.

So those who are serious about performance on Android, tend to bypass Java as much as possible and use the NDK which is designed for native code (primarily C/C++, but can be used for other things, including Swift).

That said, you are writing a networking app. Ultimately, you will be going through the networking stack of the platform. Again, back to understanding your bottlenecks, you might be I/O bound all the time or limited by the platform's networking stack available to you. In the end, iOS/Android may not make a difference. Java/Swift may not make a difference. But hardware might make the difference. ISP might make the difference. Kernel differences in the network stack might make the difference.

That said, I personally would approach it by writing it natively using either C or Swift, but writing it in a portable manner so I could run it on both iOS and Android. (Android Swift is still raw, so it takes some care and planning if you use Swift.)

applishish,"> I have choice of Android or Mac. I know Swift compiles to machine code whereas Android(which I am planning to write in Kotlin) runs in JVM ?

No, it doesn't.  I don't know where you got your architecture knowledge, but Android (at least since version 5, several years ago) doesn't run apps in a JVM.  All binaries are AOT compiled.

> So relatively speaking for same code base, is Android app slower than iOS as apps runs in JVM? For android assume user has top of line Samsung device.

They have different CPU speeds and quantities and functional units, different languages and runtimes and standard libraries, different RAM sizes and speeds ... there's no equal comparison to be made here.  It's only in the world of clickbait headlines that you can say one is faster than the other for every task.

naughty_ottsel,"I would say it isn’t by design. But an outcome of choices.

It’s become a meme and a joke to talk about how slow Java can be, which it can be, but in the case of Android my understanding is that the binary is a bit closer to the VM and so doesn’t have major penalties, but there are still penalties as you aren’t running right on the metal.

I am not sure of Kotlin’s Memory Management system but I would hazard a guess it uses the JVM Garbage Collector. As others have said Garbage Collectors do have a negligible performance penalties. iOS has always used reference counting moving away from manually managed to automatic which is part of the Swift Compiler.

There have been different philosophies on multitasking as well. Android has pushed to be more *true* multitasking which allows multiple processes to run at the same time. iOS on the other hand has followed a *faux* method; making it look like multitasking is happening, but background apps don’t get much CPU time when they are allowed it. Which allows more CPU time for the foreground app.

I think core Android has pulled back on this a bit, but the vendors can still change this.

With that in mind, vendors/carriers can modify the OS for additional features which may eat up resources as well.

Finally as others have mentioned, hardware for Android and iOS varies greatly and even hardware within the Android ecosystem itself can vary greatly. Up until the A11 at least, iOS hardware was much better at single core performance than SOC’s used for Android which helped the idea of foreground apps having more of the CPU time.

    /** Maps values in the range 0...1 to 0...1 using an exponential curve. */
    func curve(_ value: CGFloat, rate: CGFloat) -> CGFloat {
      precondition(rate > 0.0)

      guard value < 1.0 else { return 1.0 }

      var shape: UIBezierPath?

      override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
        guard let shape = shape else { return }

        // Draw successively smaller paths with a new color
        let steps = Int(max(shape.bounds.maxX, shape.bounds.maxY))
        let stepFactor = 1.0 / CGFloat(steps)
        let shapeMid = CGPoint(x: shape.bounds.midX, y: shape.bounds.midY)

        for i in 0..<steps {
          let copy = UIBezierPath(cgPath: shape.cgPath)

          // scale and center
          let scale = CGFloat(steps - i) * stepFactor
          copy.apply(CGAffineTransform(scaleX: scale, y: scale))
          let copyMid = CGPoint(x: copy.bounds.midX, y: copy.bounds.midY)
          copy.apply(CGAffineTransform(translationX: shapeMid.x - copyMid.x,
                                       y: shapeMid.y - copyMid.y))

          // generate color and set it as fill color
          let colorScale = curve(CGFloat(i) * stepFactor, rate: 1.0)
          UIColor(red: colorScale,
                  green: colorScale,
                  blue: 1.0,
                  alpha: 1.0).setFill()

          // fill the shape
          copy.fill()
        }
      }
    }

I put the curve function in there because a simple linear color transition didn't look good - the color transition was too sharp. This might be avoided by using a hue-saturation-balance color value instead of an RGB one, due to how our vision reacts to color. Anyways, transition from one color to another however you see fit.

You get these through a formal training program or by intense, guided, self-study. The problem is that when you're one person working on an app which isn't for a real-time system or which doesn't have huge resource requirements you can get by without knowing most of these things. If you want to move on to a bigger company you'll need knowledge in most of these things.

The companies know it and they are not willing to wait for you to learn it on the job. That's why they want college graduates, nearly every CS program teaches all of these concepts to some extent. If they hire someone out of a decent CS program they know that the programmer has at least been exposed to the ideas and has some degree of familiarity with them.

How can you get this kind of knowledge? Certainly you can seek it out and teach it to yourself, but it's tough to know *what* to know. You can see if someone has written up the details of what to learn but that's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem.

Or you can go to a local university and take a few courses. Even a couple of the beginner CS courses should get you pretty far. Then you'll have proof you were exposed to the ideas, you can show prospective employers that you have some formal training. You can even go further and take enough to get an associate's degree, or slowly work on a bachelor's degree.

The person on the other side of the table is unlikely to be 1/2 as knowledgable and competent as they seem, since they've been able to cherry pick the questions, research the answers, and have everything RIGHT at their fingertips.

I've been working at reasonably large tech companies for...11 years now?  I've never qualified for the job as posted.  I don't qualify for the job I hold now, yet I think I do good work, and there's a pretty constant string of praise from coworkers and management and promotions along the way.

All that to say: Take what you feel you've been missing in each interview, and work to fill that knowledge gap.  Know that a lot of this will help _ONLY_ in interviewing, as that's an art unto itself.  Once you get hired at one big tech company, you're probably set.  From that point on as long as you do good work, and are passingly personable, you'll have a never ending stream of people trying to pull you into whatever company they work for, and that'll make all of your interviews like 20% as difficult as what you're doing now.",1524166155.0
LumeAbus,"There was a study, I don't remember from where, but when people know a decent amount in their field, they feel like they don't know a lot because they understand there is so much they don't understand, however, people who don't know much about a field, feel smart because they can't tell how much they still have yet to learn.",1524215990.0
badlcuk,"This is how you know you're on a good path. You know you're missing information -- you know you know very little comparatively. 

FWIW I never worked on 'large scale' apps with millions of users until my current job, and that was only the past year since I graduated in 2011 (and I've been developing apps for companies since before I graduated). There are plenty of smaller, niche apps (and the companies that support them) that would likely be interested in your experience.


That said, if you have knowledge gaps that retain to development in general, thats a different issue. /u/thisischemistry pointed out a good list. I think these are likely where your holes in knowledge are, not the fact that you haven't worked on a big app. Everyone, even well educated college grads, will have gaps if they never worked with another individual after graduating. Mentorship at your first few jobs is so incredibly important for this reason.",1524178164.0
xtravar,"Tbh I didn’t know anything until 10 years of professional development. A huge component of it is learning how to describe code with the right words that everyone understands. It’s not about the details so much as having the ability to rationalize decisions. While it helps to know a ton of technology and jargon, that is not a signifier of capability or experience.  Pull out of the weeds and understand why things are the way they are and what advantages and disadvantages they have.

And having to maintain the same code for a decade tends to shape your opinion, too. If you haven’t had to deal with maintenance, you’re missing the entire picture of the life of that code.",1524178495.0
KarlJay001,"Have you ever worked as a professional programmer in any language or any platform?

Did you have any large projects in mind?

Have you joined up with anyone to do some open source work?

Can you be more specific with the ""after screwing up interviews with some big tech companies,""  part...

What part did you screw up?

Do you do full stack, are you focused in any area (games, business, utility...)?

Do you have any industry specific knowledge (banking, medical, financial, logistics) ?

IMO, it's not always about knowing the CS (data structures, sorts, etc...) but about being a productive programmer in a team environment.

Consider: if you decompiled the top 200 apps on the app store, how many would have a hand crafted sort or tree?  I just don't see some of the CS stuff being practical in the day to day work of an iOS dev.  Typing .sort gets it sorted without knowing how to write a qsort() from memory.  Understanding the problem solving is important though.

chain_letter,"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiswitch

Listen to the UISwitch's valueChanged, connect this from its storyboard, unless you're going programmatic. This lets you know when it gets turned on and off, which is when you change the numbers used by your dice roller and update the view to show that.

Is the dice roller taking an array, then picking an index at random? So instead of [1,2,3,4] it could be [""nine"",""ten"",""jack"",""queen""]? If so, then you have a couple options. Either way, your arrays are separate and constant.

let d4 = [1,2,3,4]

let cards = [""two"",""three"",""jack"",""queen"" ... ] 

let anotherGroup = ...

let yetAnother = .......

You get the idea. You can have a holder array that you add and remove items from as UISwitches are hit, then reference that array for rolling your dice and updating your UI with the option.

Things like Core Data, RESTful, etc...  Then I made an app from scratch.  I added things like slider menus, static view controllers, scrolling data entry screens, cached data from RSS feeds, etc...

There was no one tutorial that covered all these things.  Some covered Core Data, others RESTful, so I had to put it all together and figure out how to make it all work.

How do you draw the lines?

This is an edge detection problem and involves using specific filters to find them. From this you can create regions. It is my belief that this is the hard problem of the app.

Rather than that it's actually not too hard to do image transformations in swift. There are many libraries to support this (or were 9 months ago when I was working on this problem) 

Another possibility is to generalize similar colors together. This is a similar methodology to edge detection. You'd convert to Gray scale and then call everything within a certain pixel distance from one another a region. 

Then there's a hybrid approach, doing both. Which is also an option.

Semirgy,"First of all, congrats!

Some pointers that I would give looking back on my journey into iOS (similar background to you.):

1) Build a GitHub portfolio that demonstrates your knowledge and skill level. At first, just focus on small projects (a note-keeping app that loads into a table view.) Make sure your projects become more and more advanced as you learn more and demonstrate that on GitHub. On this same note, you need to learn version control in-depth. Know Git inside and out.

2) Network, network, network. Follow people in the iOS community on YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. **Go to every iOS Meetup in your area** and don't just go once, but be a constant presence. I go to two and both usually have someone looking for devs. 

3) Learn some CS fundamentals, *especially* Data Structures/Algorithms. Virtually every interview you have is going to ask you DS/Algo questions and if you flunk them, you're toast. You need to have a deep understanding of Big-O to the point where you can look at any algorithm in an interview and give the Big-O runtime. I would highly recommend going through a general algorithms course (Sedgewick offers two free Coursera courses - Algorithms I and Algorithms II - that are great.) I cannot overstate this: you have to understand fundamental DS/Algos; it's no less important than UIKit when it comes to technical interviews. 

4) Understand design patterns (MVC, MVVM, etc.) and more general OOP things like Singletons, Facades, etc. If a recruiter reaches out and wants you to complete a coding challenge and you shove everything into one massive view controller... you're toast. 

Those are things that come to mind immediately. In general, just dive headfirst into iOS and absorb everything you can. 

Hope that helps. Others can chime in and/or disagree with what I've said.",1523988741.0

theprangnetwork,"Have you tried casting them to `NSNumber` / `Number` and then using properties like `doubleValue`, `intValue`, etc? In addition, I would *strongly* recommend using Codable instead. `JSONSerialization` still exists but using Codable will be much safer and it will make it much easier to validate your JSON and ensure that it's in the right format. Your code above could be condensed into this:

    struct PartialItem: Codable {
        let group: String
        let id: String
        let something: Int
        let somethingElse: Int
        let updatedAt: Double
    }

    let partialItem = try JSONDecoder().decode(PartialItem.self, from: payload)

There's no possibility of you misspelling a key name or something, and if `payload` doesn't match, you'll get a nice error thrown that tells you why not. If you want a property to be optional, just mark it optional and Codable will figure it out. 

**Edit**: If you want to nest something, or if the struct in your example is nested in something else, you can just do something like this:

    // Structs and classes with Codable members are also Codable.
    struct FullItem: Codable {
        let partialItem: PartialItem

    struct Game {
      var turnCount: Int
      var playerList = [Player]()

      mutating func takesTurn(player: Int) {
         // Don't forget to validate those indexes!
        guard player < playerList.count else { return }
        self.turnCount += 1
        // Do something with self.playerList[player]
      }
    }

You see here that `takesTurn(player:)` operates on a `Game` instance instead of a `Player` instance. Call it like:

    var game = Game(turnCount: 0, playerList: [Player(hasName: ""Player 1"")])
    print(game.turnCount)       // 0
    game.takesTurn(player: 0)
    print(game.turnCount)       // 1

RECURSIVE_META_JOKE,"Short answer: Use an image cache library because it's the easiest, cleanest, and most performant solution. Don't use NSUserDefaults or CoreData.

Long answer: You should use a cache that stores/retrieves the data in file/memory as needed.  [NSCache](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscache) is provided by Apple and can handle the memory cache side, but you'll want a filesystem backing store as well so the data is persisted even after the memory cache flushes the image for whatever reason.

You don't have to roll your own solution, instead...

 * If you're retrieving the image using [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession), it has caching available out of the box if you configure the session for caching.
 * If you're retrieving the image through other means, you can use a library like [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) or [Haneke](https://github.com/Haneke/HanekeSwift).  I believe both use NSCache as the memory cache, but they will handle a lot of the common cache operations for you.

Don't use NSUserDefaults or CoreData as they are not meant for storing binary data.  I can't think of any cases where either of them are better than an actual image cache, and they'll take more time to both implement and maintain.",1523761998.0

VanHoutte1337,"Hi

I moved from MVC to MVVM. MVVM is (in my opinion a great architectural pattern) a great way to keep your code clean. The disadvantage is that you need something for the UI binding. This is where RxSwift comes in handy. This allows me easily bind my viewcontrollers to my viewmodel.

I have used it several times and I think I could not go back to the old method (working with delegates, emitters, etc).

When I got the hang of binding my UI to my viewmodels with RxSwift, I took it a step further and implemented my whole network layer with RxSwift. You have to think in a different way and this is what makes reactive programming so hard. I can admin that the syntax for RxSwift (Rx in general) doesn't  look that appealing but you get the hang of it after a while.

I used the Ray Wenderlich book to learn RxSwift. It's hard at first, even when trying to make the examples. The best way to learn is to struggle with it in your own project.

Perhaps nice if I would be used to React from JavaScript but it tends to turn a lot of things upside down people are used to plus it's completely impossible to remove it again.

You don't need a framework for MVVM. For immutable data structures. Or for an application that responds to events instead of endless callback blocks in view controllers and ugly hackarounds to handle websocket or push notification messages.

For example instead of creating an IBAction in your LoginViewController that calls the auth API and then processes the error or resulting logged in user on the spot you should simply call an event when the login call has finished:

    LoginEventHandler.handle(event: .loggedIn(user))

or perhaps:

    LoginEventHandler.handle(event: .loginFailed(reason))

LoginEventHandler knows about what classes want to listen to updates about LoginEvents and sends them the right ViewModel (built by a ViewModelBuilder). LoginEventHandler knows when to call the (Login)Router to push or pop to what different screen. But all one liners, no boiler plate in there.

     protocol LoginEventListener: class {
          handle(login: LoginViewModel)
     }

Put the blocks you are triggering by button actions etcetera in the ViewModel, just like the login action that triggered the network request to the auth API. I have an extension for UIButton that helps me attach blocks to actions without adding boiler plate to a controller or view. I often even put translations and label values in ViewModels. 

The auth API callback doesn't call back directly to the LoginViewController but simply calls the LoginEventHandler with the logged in user. And that's it. Everything else Rx seems to give you is perhaps syntactic sugar and helpers.",1523623052.0
dancemonkey,"Braces enclose the *scope* of the code block, kind of like parenthesis in a math problem encloses a set of calculations. They're simply a way to ""wall off"" different blocks of code from one another. Not all languages use them (Python does not, for instance). It's not just visually easier to see where one block of code ends and another begins, it's actually required to use them in Swift.

The indentaion is not required but is enforced automatically by XCode (or Playgrounds), again it's primarily so you can visually see what belongs with what. Indenting code inside a set of braces visually tells you that it ""belongs"" to that block (or is within that scope). It makes the code much more readable.

Braces are required in Swift, indentation is technically not (though you should go along with it if XCode or the Playground is indenting your code).",1523562951.0
applishish,"> what do Curly Braces mean and why are they sometimes indented. Sorry if this is so basic but I can't seem to find an answer in lame's terms

The reason you can't find a simple answer could be because there isn't one.  Swift uses curly braces for a dozen different things:

 - closures
 - switches
 - blocks
 - property observers
 - computed property accessors
 - enum definitions
 - struct definitions
 - class definitions
 - protocol definitions
 - extensions
 - precedence groups
 - attribute usages

Don't try to memorize the list.  Just accept that ""{}"" can mean lots of different things, and that each one you learn may or may not be similar to others you've learned.

As for why they're only *sometimes* indented, I've been using Swift for a few years and I have no clue why the Xcode/Swift engineers decided that some of them (like switches) should not be.  That drives me crazy.
",1523567992.0
thisischemistry,"In Swift indentation is completely up to the programmer, it's never necessary. This is true of many types of white space (spaces, tabs, end-of-lines, and so on) when you have more than one of them. You put the extra spaces in there to indicate to anyone reading it that your code has entered a new level of nesting, called a ""scope"" - like those Russian nesting dolls sitting inside each other. Each new level of indentation is used for a new scope. It's completely a visual indicator to help readability.

Curly braces are used to *actually* scope your code. Local variables and other definitions are limited by that scope. So say I define a variable at the top scope, the one with no curly braces:

    let foo = 5 // in global scope, depth 0

(Anything after a `//` is a comment, including the `//` - the compiler ignores it.)

Now `foo` is in the ""global scope"", which means it can be used in all inner scopes.

How about if I define a function:

    let foo = 5          // in global scope, depth 0

    func bar() {         // start function bar() scope, depth 1
      let baz = foo + 5
    }                    // end function bar() scope

I said that `foo` is available everywhere. The `func bar() { ... }` defines a new scope, inner to the global scope. In it I define `baz` which will only be good for that scope. When the function ends at the `}` then `baz` will be unavailable.

    let foo = 5               // in global scope, depth 0

    func bar() {              // start function bar() scope, depth 1
      let baz = foo + 5
    }                         // end function bar() scope

    func bar2() {             // start function bar2() scope, depth 1
      let baz = foo + 10

      if baz > 15 {           // start if statement scope, depth 2
        let qux = baz - 2
      }                       // end if statement scope
    }                         // end function bar2() scope

So you can see it gets even more complex. You have `foo` at global scope, a `baz` scoped to `bar()`, a `baz` scoped to `bar2()`, and `qux` scoped to an `if` statement inside `bar2()`. Each one of these is generally available to any scope more inner than where it's declared, but not available to any scope more outer.

By the way, there's tons of ways you can indent your code. The one I use here is pretty common but there are many variations. Pick one and stick with it, if you work on code that has a style then keep with theirs:

[Indentation style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style)

I tend to follow [OTBS Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Variant:_1TBS_\(OTBS\)) but put my `else` on a new line like [Stroustrup style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Variant:_Stroustrup).",1523563060.0

When iOS started, they were asking for 6 months and any kind of app that compiles.  If you look at other jobs, they ask for 7~10 years exp.

iOS is different from the old days, the mobile bubble is mainly in selected areas.  Look at programming jobs vs iOS jobs.  Programming is everywhere, iOS isn't.

In addition, mobile is in a bubble.  They are gambling on what is going to lead the way, just like they did with DotCom.  We learned from DotCom and saw that Amazon, eBay and others came out ahead because of what they did with the tech.  Same thing is going on with mobile.  Point: they aren't really looking for entry level programmers.  This is why they give the algorithm tests (even thou iOS devs don't write algorithms much), they can't really invest without vetting people.

The other issue is tons and tons of people have been rushing into mobile, the gold rush was indie apps, that's flooded out and it's been ""get a great job"" gold rush that's also being flooded out.

    extension Array where Element: Equatable {
        public static func ==(lhs: [Element], rhs: [Element]) -> Bool {
            return lhs.elementsEqual(rhs)

cannibaldolphin,"When you press `next` you go through all the images, assigning them to the variable. Think about what this does (pseudo-code):

```
var images = [one, two, three]

// go through the images and do this to *each* image:
for image in images {
  imageView.image = image
}

// first loop
ImageView.image = one 
// second loop 
ImageView.image = two 
// third loop
ImageView.image = three 
```

This is how you end up on image three every time. 

What you want is to either write a thin wrapper around Array, which provides ring-like properties, or just implement that logic directly in next/previous. 

Example:

```
var currentIndex: Int
var images: [UIImage]

func next() {
  // increment index
  currentIndex += 1
  // if index goes out of bounds loop around
  if currentIndex >= images.count {
    currentIndex = 0
  }
  ImageView.image = images[currentIndex]
}

func previous() {
   // same thing, but we want to wrap around after 0
 }
```

You may also note that what we did in `next` is really just the modulo operation. 

So, I recommend writing a thin, generic wrapper around Array which takes care of all of this for you, but you can also just hard-code this logic into your view controller if you want. ",1523550449.0

xtravar,"I am having some difficulty understanding but I think I can explain what you want.

It all has to do with the view hierarchy being independent of the view controller hierarchy. Navigation controller is a view controller. Using viewDidLoad is not going to guarantee that you are in a view controller hierarchy.

You can only have a non-nil self.navigationController when the view controller is within a navigation controller. Otherwise, it is a nil reference and your line of code does nothing.

For the first view controller, its view probably loads after it has a navigation controller, meaning your line of code works.

For the others, they probably do not have the view controller hierarchy at their point or viewDidLoad.

For a concrete example: I can have a view controller’s view loaded before I call pushViewController. viewDidLoad will happen when self.navigationController is nil, but viewWillAppear will happen when it references the parent VC.

If you are specifically asking about tab bar controller, it loads its view at init for whatever reason. Some Apple view controllers do. 

You can’t depend on viewDidLoad being a view controller-related event and instead maybe want to look into didMoveToParentViewController etc",1523503411.0

In principle some version of Swift is available for other systems, but for a beginner I’d recommend a Mac where everything is installed for you via Xcode. Doesn’t have to be a shiny new Mac.

Imagine if you started treating `someVariable` like a `String` (for example, accessing the `count` property), but it ends up being an `Int` (which doesn't have a `count` property). Presumably that'd be a crash. And this is exactly the type of thing that Swift's type safety aims to avoid.

If you only care about whether a specific value is a `String` or an `Int`, you could do this:

    let isStringOrInt = (someArray[x] is String) || (someArray[x] is Int)

Or if you want to actually treat that values as its actual type, you could do something like:

    if let stringItem = someArray[x] as? String {

    } else if let intItem = someArray[x] as? Int {
        // Do stuff with Int value
    } else {...}

    let strings = someArray.compactMap { $0 as? String }    // use flatMap Swift 4.0 and earlier

Then you group the data by the fingerprint and present it to the user, allowing them to make the final decisions of what belongs together.

A good way of fingerprinting strings might be to run a [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem) on the strings and see how much of it matches in relation to it's total size. Obviously, the more that matches the more likely they are to be related. For example:

The LCS for them would be ""AWalsh"", a 0.857 (6/7) match for the second string. That's a pretty good match so it indicates they may be related.

> Using IB results in less Objective-C or Swift code, but IB does use “code” in the form of an undocumented, arguably inscrutable XML file. In one production iOS app, this file is 2503 lines long.

XML doesn't look inscrutable to me, but holy crap, 2500 lines?  How does that even happen?  And once it does, why blame it on IB?  I don't put 2503 lines of code in one function and then blame the programming language for letting me.

> IB’s XML format is subject to change between Xcode versions. Changes in format can cause warnings that the developer has to fix. Two apps developed by the Author experienced these warnings, examples of which appear in the following screenshot.

Am I just exceptionally lucky?  I've been using storyboards for years and never had a single warning caused by an Xcode upgrade.

> Because the IB file format is not backwards-compatible, old storyboards and XIBs cannot even be opened in newer versions of Xcode, a situation described here.

This is a situation so rare he doesn't even seem to have experienced myself -- just that he read about it on someone else's old blog.  It sounds like all the problems were involving the old binary NIBArchive format.  AFAIK the new XML format is fully backwards compatible.

> IB hides implementation details from the iOS-development-learner.

I suppose that's true, in the same way any abstraction does this.  Swift hides implementation details from the assembly language learner!  Assembly language hides implementation details from the IEEE-754 learner!  As Carl Sagan said, if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe.  You can always avoid abstractions if you wish to learn what's under them, but that doesn't make abstraction bad.

> Global changes to colors, fonts, paddings, and constraint constants are tedious and error-prone.

Finally, a realistic criticism of IB!  I like to think there should be a good solution to this, but I don't know of one yet.  It doesn't seem insurmountable, with the right tooling.

> In a world where reviewers of pull requests rightfully expect every commit in a pull request to reflect developer intent, these no-op changes are problematic.

So ... don't commit them?  I don't see the problem.  .DS_Store would be just as problematic, if you were crazy enough to commit them.  It's *good* that reviewers are catching these!

> Admittedly, these conflicts can be minimized, but not eliminated, by putting each UIViewController’s visual representation in its own storyboard.

Ha, I love it.  As the final note, we admit that, yes, you can minimize problems if you follow the best practices you should be following anyway.  Also, source code is bad because it often has bugs, but if you break it up into *functions*, that can help to minimize them!

&nbsp;

Please note that this solutions doesn't use protocols  or delegates (hence my preface above haha).

&nbsp;

(For the example below we will say the ContainerView object has an IBOutlet variable name of 'containerView' )

&nbsp;

First, in your ViewController which contains the container view add a variable which will allocate your container subview controller class later as an optional.

&nbsp;

    var containerViewSubView: ContainerViewItemClass?

&nbsp;

In addition, make another variable which will store the currently displayed view within the container (this will be useful for when/if you add more sub views for the container view):

&nbsp;

    var currentSubView: NSView?

&nbsp; 

Next, let's make a method which we will use to create our view for the container and allocate it into memory in our ViewController housing the container view:

&nbsp;

    func createContainerView() -> NSView? {
         if let containerViewSubView = containerViewSubView {
                  return containerViewSubView.view
        }

         let ourContainerView: NSViewController? = self.storyboard?.instantiateController(withIdentifier: NSStoryboard.SceneIdentifier(rawValue: ""SceneIDNameOfViewController"")) as? NSViewController

         if let ourContainerView = ourContainerView {
                containerViewSubView = ourContainerView as? ContainerViewItemClass
                return containerViewSubView.view
        }

        return nil
    }

&nbsp;

A quick breakdown as to what is happening above. The methods purpose is to create an NSView for our ViewController which will appear in the container. The first portion checks to see if our optional containerViewSubView already has a value. If it does, we just return the already existing ViewController view. If it doesn't, we attempt to make a constant called 'ourContainerView'. It's important to note that you'll need to give a scene identifier to your ViewController in your storyboard for this portion of the code to work properly. After that, we check to see if we were able to create 'ourContainerView'. If we did, we set the variable 'containerViewSubView' to ourContainerView and cast it as ContainerViewItemClass. We then return the containerViewSubViews's view. If the value for ourContainerView was unable to be set we simply return nil.

&nbsp;

Next, let's make a method that will utilize the NSView created from our createContainerView() method:

&nbsp;

     func createSubView() {
          if currentSubView == nil {
               currentSubView = createContainerView()
               containerView.addSubView(currentSubView)
          }
     }

&nbsp;

In your storyboard you'll want to remove the link from the container view to the sub view (if any exists) because with the above we can now create the subview we desire programatically. The above can also be expanded upon to accommodate as many sub views as you like. In addition, by creating and handling the sub view this way you now have a very important piece of the puzzle to solving your problem: a reference to our container subview!

&nbsp;

Armed with that reference, we can now add a weak var to the ContainerViewItemClass that will be used to reference the view controller housing the container view. Something like this will do:

&nbsp;

       weak var mainViewController: ViewControllerWithContainerView?

&nbsp;

Jumping back to our code from above you can now add the following line to our createSubView() method:

&nbsp;

      containerViewSubView.mainViewController = self

&nbsp;

So it should look like this now:

&nbsp;

     func createSubView() {
          if currentSubView == nil {
               currentSubView = createContainerView()
                containerViewSubView.mainViewController = self
               containerView.addSubView(currentSubView)
          }
     }

&nbsp;

And just like that, our subview now has a way to call back to our main view! In the class for the sub view you can now do things like:

&nbsp;

      IBAction func clickedButton() {
            mainViewController.varibaleToAdjust = newVariableValue
     }

&nbsp;

Again, I know it's probably not the most elegant solution but it certainly should do what you're looking to do =)

&nbsp;

Eoghain,"The problem is in how you are using your `if let` commands.  `if let post = postsDictionary[String: AnyObject]` is a nonsense line of Swift.  I believe what you are trying to do is `print(""hi"")` if your post object (a tuple of key:value) has in it's value a description, and a downloadURL.  

What you probably meant to write is:

    if let desc = post.value[""description""] as? String, let url = post.value[""downloadURL""] as? String {
       print(""hi"")
    }

This code uses `if lets` to store the description and the url if they exist in local variables then executes your print.  Notice that I left out your first `if let` after the `print(post)` line.

If however you just wanted to verify that `description` and `downloadURL` exist in your data then you don't need `if let` at all.

    if post.value[""description""] != nil, post.value[""downloadURL""] != nil {
        print(""hi 2"")

Ancedotal, but my first dev job was taking on a objc app and a few months in I decided to throw in some swift just for practice. So if you're set on doing a bootcamp, I would do one that teaches both. 

I also wanna throw in my 2 cents about boot camps. The good thing about them is that they provide a place to learn. Everyone has the same goal and works through the same problems, plus there are TAs to help when you're stuck. However, they can be pricey and you can just as easily learn everything on your own, as long as you're self motivated. 

My cheap alternative recommendation (to anyone, not just OP.):

1. Big nerd ranch objective-c programming ~3-5 weeks
. 
2. Apple's Swift documentation 2-5 days.

3. Stanford's iOS course 
https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/ 1-2 months (I haven't done the whole thing, but I learned a lot from the parts I did)
 
1 will give you programming basics and a solid foundation with objc. 2 will introduce you to syntax, and the ""swifty"" way. And 3 will show you some design patterns, how to use xcode and cocoa touch, and how to build an app. 

At that point you can start building your own relatively simple shit. So do that. Also contribute to open source projects. That will give you the opportunity to see and build upon other people's code. And while you are learning, go to meet ups and tap into the programming community.

I'd get the Udemy, Lynda.com or some other inexpensive tutorials and keep going thru them.  Once you have a handle on Swift, try the Stanford 193P course online for free.  They have a number of different ones, try several years just to get a good handle on them.

mduser63,"Having designed a bootcamp curriculum myself, I think it's a little strange to still be using Objective-C as the _main_ language. Where I taught, we switched from Objective-C to Swift near the end of 2015 as it became clear that Swift was viable and being used widely enough that Objective-C mastery wasn't a 100% requirement for all iOS jobs. That has only gotten more true in the past 2+ years.

In my last curriculum as well as the one I'm building now, I use Swift as the primary language of instruction, with about 20% of the course spent on Objective-C. It feels like the right balance. Swift is an easier language to start with, and is clearly the future of most iOS development. Objective-C continues to be very important, and I don't think it can be skipped altogether, but at this point, being an ObjC expert is not a requirement for most new iOS developers. (I say this as an ObjC developer since before the iPhone came out, and someone who still loves and writes a whole lot of ObjC.)",1523312658.0
thisischemistry,"Just remember that most employers will not look to hire people who come out of bootcamps. You'll need years of learning to even be considered for any serious job. The types of jobs you might get out of a bootcamp are small contract-for-hire things from small business owners looking to get a cheap app out of it. Those really don't pay well and will take you many hours of work without the proper programming experience.

You're much better off enrolling in a local college and getting an associates degree in computer science or the equivalent. Work on some open source projects and apps of your own, build up your repertoire, try to get hired on somewhere as an intern or junior developer.

A bootcamp is best for people who already have some decent experience in programming and want to learn a specific language or environment. Even then you can learn about the same stuff for free on your own, the big difference is a bootcamp is a structured environment and may lessen the time needed to learn the language.

quellish,"I do not know what you mean by ""lock"" here, but you're making a query against the user's music library. If you use a `contains` predicate with ""The"" you are going to get matches for everything that contains those characters. You could perform additional filtering of your own on those results though at least historically this was very slow to do. 

> I tried changing the predicate item from artist to artistPersistantID but that makes it very specific onto B.B. King and not featuring anybody else

It may, it may not. It depends on how the metadata on the media was set. Content that has multiple artists set correctly should match more than one artist ID. The thing is, few music libraries have consistent and correct metadata. Even if all the content was purchased from the iTunes music store the metadata may be less than ideal. It is pretty typical for a user library to be a mix of content from iTunes, ripped from CDs, MP3s that came from somewhere on the internet and other sources. 

Because of this many music applications use third party services (MusicBrainz, etc) to identify music and maintain their own metadata inside the application rather than rely on the music library as the source of truth. This too can be slow and cumbersome, especially with large libraries. Large libraries are a thing - it used to be that the music library was some number of songs that had been synced to the device using iTunes. A long time ago cloud libraries were introduced, which made every song in a user's library available ""instantly"". This significantly complicates any use of the library metadata or content.",1523319424.0

I get they want to keep the library light, but how much more overhead would it have been to at least be able to do an `OR` search.

Catfish_Man,"Generally I’d say your current approach of pushing the conversion to human readable formats as far towards the view layer as possible is the right one.

banaslee,"The only case I would consider having a human readable string on an entity would be if that piece of data comes formatted from the server. 
Otherwise I recommend you save it as a Date instead of a human readable string or an NSNumber. 

To add to this, normally you have formatting logic very near the UI layer, where all the views exist. You translate entities into strings and numbers right before you apply those strings and numbers in your views. 

In a Clean Swift approach you’d have the Presenter receiving entities (like your Message) from the Interactor and creating a view model with the formatted dates that it then passes to the View Controller that applies that view model to its views. 

The Presenter has access to DateFormatter objects to format that Date into a String object. 
Also, if you are worried about performance then reuse DateFormatter objects whenever possible. A simple rule of thumb is, if the format is the same you should be reusing it throughout the app and only delete from memory in case there’s a memory warning.

I've worked on systems that dealt with real users and real phone numbers before, and I can tell you no user ever complained that they couldn't type their (North American) phone number as `65/05/5512/34`, while many dozens or hundreds complained that they couldn't enter an extension like `(650) 555-1234 x111`.

That said, here's an outline of the solution:

While keeping a count of how many digits have been encoutered so far, iterate the input string character by character (the standard Swift `for c in str` should work), if the character is a digit (can be matched using for example, switch statement with `case ""0""...""9"":`) increment the digit counter and append it to the output. If you are at the specific indecies (where the '-' should be inserted) insert the '-'. If the input is done and the number of digits has not reached 10, it's invalid so return an empty string. If you see the 11th digit, it's invalid so return an empty string.

By passing data from one to the other, this means that one view controller needs to know about the other view controller.  The first needs to import the other so it can make an instance of it and pass to it.  

This is bad.  There is no reasonable justifiable reason why the first VC should need to know anything about the next one.  This creates a dependency that's worse than it appears.  This means that each view controller that needs to pass data to the next must include the next.  If you have a chain of 10 view controllers, then you get the first VC importing the second, which imports the third, which imports the fourth, which imports the fifth, which imports the sixth, which imports the seventh, which imports the eighth, which imports the ninth, which imports the tenth.  

You create dependencies in items that should be independent, that should not need to care about each other by passing data through segues.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

A few years back.  I simply made a table view with the results one way then the other and summarized the results.  It could be done better with charts, decision tree, and animations.

You said algorithms have been done already, I'm studying that now, where are these simulations for algorithms?

You could also setup a card game framework where a person can alter the rules and check the outcome.

Example: I posed a question about a simple card game and what card would have the best outcome.  The game is simple: 2 players, each get all of a suit, they play one card at a time, highest card wins the contest.

Player A plays 7, 8, 9 to player B's A, K, Q...  What's the best play for player A?

So you'd simulate the playing of the remaining 10 cards and record their outcome.  You could set on player as random card selection and the other as top to bottom based on face value.

You could then alter the setting so that they are both random, or bottom to top, or 1>than last card played, etc...

In the above example: if player B plays a card < 6, can player A win with a straight A to 2 run?  A win is simply 7 of the 13 contests.

A playground that would have a number of options to control the path would be great: number of plays, options for each player.  Even a struct for each card so that betting could be allowed.",1523094492.0

> I don't want to put something out there that no one will buy.

The $64,000 question I have is: what is so special about simulations *in Swift* that would make me want to buy a language-specific book about it, when there are already many good (non-Swift-specific) books about the subject?  It's a new language in terms of syntax but the data structures and control flow are essentially identical to every other mainstream language.  (I could see buying a book on simulation in Erlang or Prolog, because they're unconventional in structure, but not Swift.)  Or s it meant to be more like ""an introduction to programming and Swift for scientists and mathematicians""?

The other potential issue I see is that any non-trivial simulation is going to involve concurrency, and since they're still designing the new concurrency model for Swift 5 and beyond, any book I bought this year or next is either going to ignore this topic, or immediately become obsolete.

I recommend that you find some starting courses in programming, either locally or online. Learn the basics of the [theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation), how binary representation works, the basic algorithms and structures, scheduling, memory, storage, user interaction, and so on. You'll probably learn a programming language in the process but the language is the least important aspect of programming. Once you learn the other stuff any language will be pretty simple to pick up and use.

Get a mentor, have them guide your learning. Participate in an open source game or project. Do small things at first, don't dive into a game. Believe me, most people rush in headlong and end up burning themselves out, getting too frustrated to accomplish anything. Or worse, they never learn good programming practices and constantly fight their own code, wasting a lot of time producing something that barely works and is a nightmare to maintain.

applishish,"The article quotes Lattner's goal of ""total world domination"", but then defines the competition as languages which ""aspire to become a general purpose language for all the domains that C++ currently encompasses"".  Well, that's certainly one direction to take it.

I assume the author believes, as I do, that despite Lattner's lofty goal, there's no way that Swift is ever going to be competitive in the same space as, say, Elixir.  It just wasn't designed for that.  (We're heading into version 5 and a concurrency model is still an explicit ""non-goal"".)  It may turn out to be a better C++, but it's never going to be a better Erlang, JavaScript, or Bash.

> consider writing a fully working cross platform system library

The trouble I see is that for a lot of these (like the first case, databases) the problem isn't writing the code, but creating a standard.  It's not hard to find and use a C library for accessing your favorite database.  The real improvement that a Swift library could offer is a familiar interface for all databases, but for that to happen, you need to be in the position to define a standard for it -- like JDBC for Java.  The individual programmer isn't generally in that position.  A company (like Apple or IBM or Google) is.

That's not to say I couldn't try to create a standard, but I don't have the perspective that would let me create a great one, and if one of these companies decided to do it, their popularity would simply steamroll my project in short order.  So I don't have much incentive to try.  The best bet here is maybe to get a couple client developers from different database projects in the same room to hash out something.

> Rewrite Existing C libraries ... a great opportunity for learning more C and in turn loving Swift even more ;-)

I've rewritten a couple C functions in Swift for my own use, and they certainly do not make me love Swift.  Swift is good at some things, and C is good at some things, but they're not the same things.  Bit-twiddling and FFI with Swift can be downright painful.

Here's a meta-project for anyone to try: can you make a Swift library that makes bit-twiddling and calling C functions really easy, and so it doesn't change syntax completely every time there's a new Swift version?

> Care about Linux

This is a big one, but it's not (just) about third-party libraries.  The standard libraries still have lots of bugs and holes on Linux.  It's not really practical for me to care about Linux support with my own libraries yet when 90% of that would mean adding kluges to deal with the Swift differences.

Right now, Swift on Linux is so different in behavior it's really only usable there for projects which are completely disparate from Mac/iOS applications, like web servers.  Making the standard library work identically on all platforms would go a long way.

> Support Swift Package Manager

The situation with the packaging system is a total mess right now.  There's 3 major players, and so you not only have to find a library that does what you need, but it needs to support the package manager you use.  This is another case where an individual contributor can't do a lot.  (""I'm sorry, but if you want unanimous consent, you're going to have to get it from one of the other owners!"")  I think it's clear that we're getting better at writing package managers, since they're getting a lot better as they get newer.  Unfortunately, SPM seems to lack some important capabilities of Carthage (AFAICT), and the documentation is still lousy.  I think the most useful things an individual can do today are to add features to SPM to make it a usable alternative, and to help document it so people understand how to use it.  Be practical -- think ""I've got an Xcode app"", not ""Imagine you're writing a console program to shuffle playing cards, with no external dependencies"".

We don't need to set out to try to kill CocoaPods/Carthage.  We just need to improve SPM enough that it's the logical choice.

> you can still help out by using it / testing it on Linux and submitting bug reports. The more people use it, the more stable it will become.

Yeah, I wish this were true, but the bugs aren't exactly a mystery.  On bugs.swift.org right now there are 423 open bugs that mention Linux.  As Jerry Seinfeld would say, anyone can *file* a bug, but the important part is the *fixing*.

Or if that isn't your thing, the next best thing would be a comprehensive test suite for Foundation, so we can see at a glance what parts of it are working the same on Linux.  CharacterSet is broken on Linux, for example, and right now you have to search the bug database to learn that, but if there were a big table that let me see at a glance which parts worked, that could be useful -- both for people who want to use it, and for people looking for something to fix.",1522868084.0

Building on swift on Windows is broken and NOT a priority of the ""core team"". Swift with the linux subsystem is an additional barrier that many newcomers don't want to take. Without Windows there is no way swift gains a more relevant momentum.


I'd point to 3 aspects that in my opinion further limit the growth of swift.

* Corporate sponsorship

Done by Apple, but not eager to expand Swift beyong MacOS/iOS. IBM did some work on cross platform libraries, focus on they cloud^TM stuff.

* Availability + (Standard/Core) library

Some parts of the Foundation library are not implemented for Linux => no reliable cross platform behaviour. Windows support not even announced.
Furthermore the documentation is lacking. The classes + functions have a short description about the parameters, and purpose. Whats missing are short and expressive examples. Like Go and Rust have (for the most part).

* Tooling

Tooling is the most important part when learning a new language. For MacOS there is the playground and xcode.
For linux the tooling support could be greatly improved if swift had a language server implementation.
If you had autocomplete and (some) linting the language would be much more accessible.",1522926852.0

jasamer,"Step 1: Put two table views into a horizontal scrollview next to each other; each table view having the same width as the screen. Enable paging on the scrolling view. You should now be able to scroll left and right to switch the pages.

Step 2: Implement the top bar as a UISegmentedControl; add it above the scroll view. React to the action of the segmented control and let the scroll view scroll to the corresponding page. You should now be able to use the segmented control to switch pages. 

Step 3: Implement some of the UIScrollViewDelegate methods so you can update the segmented control when you scroll between pages. Now, the segmented control should update the scroll view, and the scroll view should update the segmented control.

Step 4: Set the scroll view delegate on the table views to react to up/down scrolling. This is a little tricky, but you can use these delegate calls to show/hide the tab bar when scrolling (basically: when the y-offset increases, move the bar up by the same pixel amount up to some maximum; if it decreases, move it down. One option to move the tab bar is to set its transform property to a translation transform - look into CGAffineTransform). You also have to think about what should happen with the bar when the pages are switched.

Step 5: If you want, replace the UISegmentedControl with your own control that has a custom look. It will do the same job as a UISegmentedContol though, so you should try to make your custom control work similar to the standard segmented control.

Step 6: You probably ended up with a pretty big controller, so you should now refactor your code a bit to make it more modular. For example, instead of adding two table views into the scroll view directly, have two controllers that manage each separate table view, and create a separate controller that manages the horizontal scroll view and the tab bar; that controller then contains the two table controllers as child view controllers.",1522837939.0

lukevanin,"An improvement  to NSAttributedString is definitely needed. Some things I would suggest:

**1.** It would be nice to do something like:

    “Hello”.with(attributes)
    attributes.annotate(“Hello”)

Nice and short.

**2.** The fluent chaining API is nice. It would also be nice to expose the properties as a struct, where you can access the properties individually: 

    a.foregroundColor = .blue

It would be useful to expose the properties as variables, and have an initializer with optional arguments, and a factory method with optional defaults, e.g. 

    let a = Attributes(foregroundColor: .magenta)
    let b = Attributes(lineSpacing: 12, font: myFont)
    let c = b.with(foregroundColor: .cyan)
    let s = “Hello”.with(c) 
    let s = c.annotate(“Hello”)

It would also be useful to be able to apply attributes to ranges:

    s.at(0 ..< 13).foregroundColor = .green
    s.at(0 ..< 13).annotate(attributes)

**3.** Maybe a drop in replacement for NSAttributedString is not absolutely necessary. You would gain a lot more flexibility by having a separate API, with some extensions for converting to NSAttributedString and back, e.g.

    let s =  “hello”.with(foreground: .cyan) +” “ + “world”.with(foreground: .magenta)
    let a = NSAttributedString(s)

**4.** It would be really great to support markdown, even if it’s manually annotated, I.e. semantic styling instead of explicit attributes.

    let s = “hello”.as(.heading) + “google.com“.as(.url(“http://google.com”)) + “cats”.as(.bullet)

Some quick questions:

* What's the performance of overloading the `+` operator especially combined with `NSAttributedString`? I was a fan of `Cartography` until I saw my compile times go out of the window. Also using the `+` operator in Swift is less performant run-time than String formatting (note: last time I checked). I would build a performance test around this.
* Some corner cases of using `NSAttributedString` would make it crash. Is this API safer to use?",1522843078.0
jasamer,"First, change `Attributes` to `Attribute`. An attribute could be an enum maybe? Then you'd create attributes like this: 

    let attributes: [Attribute] = [.foregroundColor(.red), .font(UIFont(name: ""Chalkduster"", size: 24.0)!), .underlineStyle(.styleSingle)]

Then, I'd create a new attributed string initialiser.

    let attributedString = NSAttributedString(""test"", attributes: attributes)

If you want to have an object representing a collection of attributes (maybe to allow convenient overriding of attributes that are already there), you could create a separate class, eg. `Style`:

    var style = Style(attributes: ...)
    style.foregroundColor = .blue
    let s = NSAttributedString(""test"", style: style)

If you want to be able to build a string with lots of formatting going on, that's a little tricky. But here's one idea for an possible API:

     let string = NSAttributedStringBuilder().style(with: [.font(UIFont(name: ""Chalkduster"", size: 24.0)!)]) { builder in
          builder.append(""Foo"") // Written in ""Chalkduster""

Swift's calling convention does not match C's, and there isn't an officially supported mechanism to export Swift functions so they're callable from C.  Swift also doesn't have an ultra dynamic runtime like many scripting languages, so you can't just re-interpret method names on the fly and invoke them.

You can however write some C glue code, or use some unsupported attributes in your Swift code which will certainly break from time-to-time until they are officially supported.

It allows you to immerse yourself in native texts in any of over 30 languages without having to constantly switch out to different apps for tools like dictionaries and alphabet charts; everything you need is inside, and accessible with a single tap.

**CORE FEATURES**

* Tap-to-define: defines a word with a popup dictionary.

* Tap-to-speak: speaks the word aloud (via text-to-speech)

* Add phonetic transcriptions: add phonetic transcriptive text like pīnyīn (for Chinese), hiragana (for Japanese), or Roman characters for any other language (e.g. Russian, Greek, etc.)

* Universal: There's large support for different language pairs (because not everyone is a native English speaker!), so e.g. a Bulgarian can learn Croatian using a Bulgarian<->Croatian bilingual dictionary.

**WHAT'S NEW

* Words are now highlighted upon tap.

* There's now a startup tutorial, made using TNTutorialManager.

* Support for looking up most languages' words even if they're not in dictionary form (blog post I made about the tech involved [here](https://birchlabs.co.uk/blog/jamie/linguabrowse/2018/03/10/looking-up-words-in-thirty-languages.html)).

You can generate the zeros this way:

    String(repeating: ""0"", count: 3)
    // returns ""000""

Here's an example session from the Swift repl:

    2> let number = 243;
    number: Int = 243
    3> let number_string = String(number)
    number_string: String = ""243""

    7> padding + number_string

michaelrockhold,"There's nothing really wrong with what you're describing. Where you need to take care is the way that shared state makes all the things that share in it just a little bit harder to reason about. Your goal should always be to design components with well-defined interfaces, and now that shared singleton is a de facto part of the interface of everything that uses it.

But worry about that on a case-by-case basis. For instance, if the singleton is basically just a bundle of mostly read-only properties, like say a preferences object, that's doesn't complicate things too much.

The other thing to consider is how you will test your VC, or any other component that depends on some app-wide singleton object. Chances are, whatever that singleton does will be something that you'll want to stub out or mock in your tests; plan how you intend to do that. There are lots of ways, but the least convenient thing for you will be if your VC acquires the singleton by calling a class method on the singleton's class. Better for the presenter to pass that dependency into the VC as it's creating or presenting it; in that case, it doesn't actually matter if the object happens to be the only instance of it's class in the whole app; from your VC's perspective, it's just another object, and while the VC is under test, it's not necessarily an instance of the exact same class the VC originally was programmed to expect.",1522372113.0
evil-element,"There is a few pro's and con's when using a singleton instance in an application. Though I choose to use them myself as a senior iOS engineer.

Many people have hot views on this, but have a good read on the web about all the use cases. ",1522402359.0
Cyberbeni,"A lot of people say that you should avoid Singletons as much as possible but in reality, you should be smart and decide when it is safe to use a singleton. Like you have a TabBarController which stores the VCs in an array, meaning they are basically singletons. But if you push other VCs on the ones you have in your tab bar, you are most likely instantiating those every time it happens. Of course some VCs can be used in multiple places at the same time with different data source. Then those shouldn't be singletons. When you are making apps for stuff that run on battery then being energy efficient actually matters a lot. (Not to mention having to instantiate a lot of stuff can take time which can ruin the user experience if it's long enough to be noticable)

""static let"" is always lazy (you can also use the ""lazy"" keyword to be extra safe and to signal your intention that you don't want to make the splash screen take even longer), so preloading your singletons in a lower priority DispatchQueue can also be a thing to consider.",1522442456.0
lucasvandongen,"Like NSUserDefaults and UIApplication are accessed as singletons. There's not more than one user and not more than one application at any given moment accessible. The difference between a class that has everything declared as static and class and a singleton is that a singleton still behaves as a class. This allows (amongst other things) Generics to work better and it's easier to refactor to a non-singleton version.

People tend to warn a lot against singletons but I have never been bitten by it. I guess you shouldn't go overboard by it and try to use stateless static classes instead or injection or simply multiple instances as much as possible.

Expecting there's only one user or one application is a good expectation. Expecting that there will only be one API endpoint or one list of users is a bad thing.",1522445920.0

* Continue using Swift with a backend framework, like Vapor. This should work on Linux.
* Try a dynamic language: node.js, Ruby on Rails, PHP etc.

Ideas:

 - Scheme or Tcl (dynamically typed, with syntactic abstraction)
 - Forth or Factor (stack-based; also, self-hosted)
 - Smalltalk or Dylan (object-oriented, and dynamically typed)

One nice thing is that all of these languages are much simpler than Swift.  Apple's Swift language book is 500 pages.  The entire Scheme language spec (including the index) is only 50 pages.  Smalltalk was originally designed to meet the challenge to create a complete and powerful object system in ""a page of code"".

thisischemistry,"If the garage is empty then an empty `Array` is a natural way to represent that fact. No need for an `Optional` in that case.

***

This does what you're asking with your structures:

    let carStrings = garages
      .flatMap { $0.cars }    // [Garage] -> [[Car]?] -> [[Car]]
      .flatMap { $0 }         // [[Car]] -> [Car]
      .map { $0.identifier }  // [Car] -> [String]
    print(carStrings) // [""123"", ""456"", ""789"", ""abc"", ""def"", ""ghi""]

- The first `flatMap` reads each `Garage.cars` property from the `[Garage]`, pulls out a `[Car]?`, unwraps it to a `[Car]` and puts it into a `[[Car]]`.

- The second `flatMap` unwraps one level of nested `Array` to convert `[[Car]]` into `[Car]`.

- The last `map` reads each `Car.identifier` property from the `[Car]` to convert it into `[String]`.

***

Thanks to u/masklinn for pointing out you can combine the two `flatMap` by using the nil-coalescing operator, `??`, to provide an empty array `[]` when there's a `nil` `[Car]?`. The `flatMap` then gets rid of when it flattens.

    let carStrings = garages
      .flatMap { $0.cars ?? [] } // [Garage] -> [[Car]?] -> [[Car]] -> [Car]
      .map { $0.identifier }     // [Car] -> [String]
    print(carStrings) // [""123"", ""456"", ""789"", ""abc"", ""def"", ""ghi""]

***

Here is a way to handle your structures in a bit more straightforward fashion:

    var carStrings = [String]()
    for garage in garages {                          // iterate over [Garage]
      guard let cars = garage.cars else { continue } // unwrap the Optional, go on to next if nil
      for car in cars {                              // iterate over [Car]
        carStrings.append(car.identifier)            // turn Car into String and append it
      }
    }

***

If you used this structure, omitting the `Optional`:

    struct Garage {
      let cars: [Car]
    }

Then this would be an easy way to generate the result you want:

    let carStrings = garages
      .flatMap { $0.cars }   // [Garage] -> [[Car]] -> [Car]
      .map { $0.identifier } // [Car] -> [String]
    print(carStrings) // [""123"", ""456"", ""789"", ""abc"", ""def"", ""ghi""]",1522197020.0
telaelit,"It’s the array itself that is optional, not the cars in the array. If you wanted to create an array of optional cars then the type would be [Car?]. But if you stick with just the array being optional (ie. [Car]?) I think what you’re looking for is just: 

let carIDs = (garage.cars ?? []).map { $0.identifier }

But if it’s an array of optional cars (ie. [Car?]) then:

let carIDs = garage.cars.flatMap { $0?.identifier }

But if you want to do an optional array of optional cars (ie. [Car?]?) then:

let carIDs = (garage.cars ?? []).flatMap { $0?.identifier }

Eh, that's not really a good demonstration of Optionals.  That's mostly just a consequence of the fact that in Java, you can't compare strings with `==`.  In any other language I can think of, you would simply do the comparison directly, and it'd look very similar to the Swift version, e.g., in Python you might say:

    favSport = person.favoriteSport
    if favSport and favSport != ""chess"":
        print(person.firstName +""'s favorite sport is "" + favSport)

cwbrandsma,"EDIT: I know my view is not popular on this...so take with a grain of salt.   In my defense, I checked with my copy of Clean Code by Bob Martin (a pretty well respected book) to see what he had to say about Switch statements.  The section is titled ""Reasons to Tolerate Switch Statements"", on page 38-39.  The defense rests.  :)  

First my disclaimer: switch statements are my most hated language element.  That goes for all languages.  They glorified gotos.  But, I still use them from time to time.

Anyway, here are my switch rules:

1. switch statements belong in their own function.  For every switch statement I write, I wrap it in a function to isolate them from the rest of the code.  Switches are dirty and diseased, which demands isolation.  
2. no 'breaks'...ever.  All cases should have a return statement.  'break' is verboten, we do not speak of it.
3. max line count for any case is 3 lines.  either you are returning a value, or calling a function.  Case statements with lines and lines of code are an anti-pattern.  Obviously, this does NOT allow you to nest switch statements, but you can call another function that contains a switch statement (see rule #1).
4. If the number of cases has to grow to where not everything fits on the screen at once, create a dictionary of functions instead.  This is not a ""hard"" rule, but more of a guideline.

KarlJay001,"I've only done a few of these, but aren't their ready made controllers for this?

It was quite a while back, but even at the start of iOS they has touch controllers for games because the feedback was so important.

Anyways, I'd look at getting a time stamp at the start of the gesture then poll (check with a timer or a thread) how long that press has been active.  So maybe a pressStarted var that is a time stamp, then an isActive.  Check if is active, check the pressStarted compared to current time and set a break point where you change over.

Once you start the rapid fire, you'd have the same var rapidStarted, rapidActive and then check it every so often, then have a spin down if you want.

The reason for this approach is that you can make a custom spin up / spin down duration.

I haven't done any speed tests, but I'd take as much code out of the ""firebullet"" routine as you can, put those into the class as var.  Is there a reason you are setting things like affected by gravity with every bullet?

I'd have some kind of very fast loop that looks at the isActive for the different types of shooting.

Maybe have a iVar that has bulletFireRate.  When the gesture is constant (on) for > X time, increase the bulletFireRate by 10% until it reaches a maxFireRate.  Then have a slowdown so that the fireBullet checks the timestamp on the bulletFireRate and drops it ever Y time.

So this way it'll increase only while they are holding, then go back to normal once they stop holding.

One reason for this is that you might have an upgrade.  I played a shooter years ago that you would win upgrades, you'd upgrade the weapon fire rate, so having this tied to that and/or the time the gesture is held helps.

Anyways, I'd look for some advanced examples because this is a very important part of the game play.  I did the RayW games years ago and they were very good.",1521866873.0

But I will say that I don't really see a good reason for a React Native developer to switch to Swift unless the developers job or client demanded it for a non technical reason.

One thing I've noticed moving from swift is that there is a real JS community there that is as diverse as it is confusing, it's even more insane because even though I'm using the react native run time, there are ways to incorporate node modules, although difficult. If you can manage to do that, there is an insane number of packages that can help you (this is the primary reason I moved over, there was more open source support for my field in js than there was in swift)

And even if you needed to use the native Apis or wanted to do something in swift/objc that wasn't super easy to do, you still have visibility to the core loader and can add native code as you see fit.

I'm not saying React Native is better than native development (I haven't done animations in RN but I'm guessing it's not as easy or fun as it is natively, although I could be wrong), but it really does provide a lot of benefits over purely native development while still providing developers the control of linking native code to the react native codebase.

thisischemistry,"Initializers for a `struct` are simple. By default you get an `internal` ""memberwise"" `init` that takes all members and initializes them. If you create your own `init` method then the default one is not created. By the end of the `init` method all members have to be initialized, either by a default value or explicitly in the `init` method.

And, um, that's pretty much it. Other than that, a `struct` `init` method is just a normal method that returns an instance of the `struct`.

Some code? Ok.

This `struct`:

    struct Foo {
      let bar: String
      let baz: Int
    }

Comes with this `init` by default:

    Foo(bar: String, baz: Int)

And it's basically implemented like this for you:

    init(bar: String, baz: Int) {
      self.bar = bar
      self.baz = baz
    }

If you create a custom `init`(of any kind):

    init() {
      self.bar = ""test""
      self.baz = 0
    }

Then the default one is not created for you and you'll have to provide it.

Oh, and any `let` members that have default values will not be included in the default memberwise `init` method.

So this:

    struct Foo {
      let bar: String = """"
      let baz: Int
    }

Default `init` will look like:

    Foo(baz: Int)",1521733969.0

matepapp,"Not sure if I understand it correctly but I think there's 2 possible way to achieve what you want.

First you can extend the Student class with an optional badge property and set an initial value in the initializer

    // MARK: Extend the Student class with optional badge property
    class Student {
        var name: String
        var year: String
        var badge: String?

        init(name: String, year: String, badge: String? = nil) {
            self.name = name
            self.year = year
            self.badge = badge
        }

        func pupil() -> String {
            return ""\(name) is a student in \(year)""
        } 
    }

    let myFriend = Student(name: ""Aisha"", year: ""SS2"") // myFriend.badge = nil
    let myFriendWithBadge = Student(name: ""Aisha"", year: ""SS2"", badge: ""badge1"") // myFriendWithBadge.badge = ""badge1""

Or you can subclass from Student and set the initial value of the badge to an empty string to prevent using optionals.
    
    // MARK: Subclassing the Student class
    class Prefect: Student {
        var badge: String

GenitalGestapo,"One issue is that your manual response parsing doesn't follow best practices.

First, it's best to model your responses (these aren't view models, by the way) using well named properties that match the expected optionality of the response, not just having every property be optional because you don't know if you'll get them out of the response dictionary.

At the same time, your parsing method doesn't allow you to represent errors, so there's no way for the app to know if it got a bad response. Instead, you'd just give it a model that has `nil` for a bunch of its properties. Whether you write your own networking stack or use Alamofire, you should likely use `Decodable` instead of doing anything manually. It generates errors for you and will even automatically generate the parsing for you.

This specific issue is also general one with your code, as you have little proper error handling (e.g. it's not appropriate to just return `UITableViewCell()` if you can't dequeue the cell type you expected. So I think learning some general Swift best practices would help you greatly in the future.

kuriishu27,"In ""Event"" you should make ""Group"" and ""Venue"" weak, otherwise you are creating a strong reference cycle.

It would be better if you made all your variables set to ""!"" instead of ""?"". This will give them a default value of nil when initialized. 

You could use a failable initializer: (init?) and add guard statements to return as soon as it doesn't find the property it needs. Still, this would not work for enums and other structs or classes since the json only understands about primitive types. This is one of the options if you want to use an initializer.

Better would be, as others have mentioned, to use the Decodable Swift Protocol. This handles literally everything to initialize your class.

Sakumo,"It sounds like the simulate function is also running asynchronous. 

For example: if simulate was this: 

    simulate() {
       sleep(10)

You’d see the code wait for simulate to finish sleeping for 10 seconds before proceeding to the leave group call. 

However, if it looks like:

    simulate() {
       DispatchQueue.main.async {
          sleep(10)
       }
    }

Your function will complete before the 10 seconds is up because it called its own asynchronous thread. Thus leave is called before the simulate function work is complete. 

One solution would involve evaluating how the function is using dispatch queues. It’s possible it may not need one if you’re going to call the function from an asynchronous queue anyway. 

If the function does require its own, then you should look into adding a dispatch semaphore to the simulate function which could be used to allow you to have the function not exit until it’s async work completes. 

As an aside, doing so on the main thread will cause the app to hang. It’s always best in those instances to use DispatchQueue.global() instead of main. This will prevent the app from hanging. 

If you have UI work that needs to be done simply wrap the UI work in a DispatchQueue.main call within the global call  and the UI will be handled appropriately.

I do think that there is a resistance to using custom operators, because they are not widely used and even if you see a familiar-looking operator in someone else's code, you have to dig in to see that they implemented in in a way you expect. Until there's a common, popular Functional library that people recognize (e.g.  ""Oh, they imported Freepoint's libFunctional."") or the operators are incorporated into Swift itself we'll always have to look through where these things are defined. (i.e. do deep dive to see if someone defined their `>>>` or `<>` operators in a sane, performant way). 

But in the past, I've been frustrated by the use of functional programming's terminology (e.g. monads, functors, etc.) and it really made it hard to see how this was more than a complex parlor trick.

""People don't like custom operators.  I think the reason is probably because of C++.""

Haha what?  Where did C++ come from?  You showed how to 'solve' a simple problem by using 5 extra keywords which are almost never used in Swift, and did it by defining a new syntax which already gave a strange error message when it wasn't perfect, and it doesn't interoperate with editor autocompletion or any of my other tooling.  I see lots of potential issues, and none has anything to do with C++.  I'm not sure most Swift programmers even know C++.  I know a little, but not enough to have an opinion on the design of its custom operators.

""In the function version, there’s stuff I can delete from here that leaves a valid Swift program behind.  There’s maybe a little bit of a metric we can use to see how reusable something is by how many things can you delete and still get a valid expression out of it.""

Wha huh?  Where did this metric come from?  I don't see how being able to delete part of a statement is an indicator of anything at all.  I can take a Forth program and delete any word anywhere and the compiler will still work.  By this metric, doesn't that make it infinitely more reusable than any functional language?

* reduce duplication of code -- don't have multiple places that code can actually be initialized. If the actual initialization is in one place, and called by the convenience `init`, it's easier to debug and change in the future.

* improve clarity at the call site -- if your initializer has optional arguments, or will fall back on default values if not supplied, then providing a shorter init makes it clear that the caller isn't concerned with those things. If it's not concerned with them, they shouldn't even need to supply data it's not interested in, just to make the `init` work.

favorited,"I'm enjoying what I've used of Vapor 3 so far, with a couple painful exceptions:

1. The locking of models to 1 particular database (at least without lots of generic hoop-jumping) is very unfortunate.  While there are benefits to the tight-coupling, there are huge downsides as well.
1. fluent-sqlite (not sure about the other adaptors) uses a really clever way of determining the types and names of your model's stored properties, by passing in a custom `Decoder` type and recording how your model attempts to decode itself.  Like most clever solutions, it seems like nice magic until it blows up at runtime and you have to dig through framework code to understand why.
1. Not Vapor-specific, but the `Future<T>`-based asynchrony model is just begging to be replaced by a Swift language feature like async/await.

        private(set) static var favorites: [Favorite] = {

Now everywhere in your application your favorites are reached easily without the mental overhead of the UserDefaults that actually back it:

    FavoritesTracker.add(favorite: favorite)

I would simply set the `editedFavorite` to something and read it from the detail screen again:

     // Somewhere in your table row tap
     let tappedFavorite = FavoritesTracker.favorites[indexPath.row]
     FavoritesTracker.editedFavorite = tappedFavorite

Make sure the table row tap also segues into the next screen.

Then in the detail view controller:

     // Inside viewDidLoad
     guard let editedFavorite = FavoritesTracker.editedFavorite else {
          fatalException(""Can't be in this screen without FavoritesTracker.editedFavorite set to something"")

        for column 0 ..< 10 {
            cell[row][column].doSomething()

I'll admit, it's a clever use of `#function`, a compiler statement which gives a string that contains the name of the function whose scope it's in. The problem is that it's cryptic and fragile. Suppose you forget or someone else works on the code, a decision is made to re-name the function, and now that cute little trick breaks down and you don't have any direct idea why.

By doing it you saved a line or two but you also made your code less readable and much easier to break by accident.

KarlJay001,"I've been programming for many years, there's a balance in programming.  The balance is in what you need to know to be a programmer.  In college they taught all kinds of stuff, including sorts and trees.  I have never written a sort professionally.  Sorts are built in to the system.

Xcode gives you templates to start, so why would you need to write a ""AppDelegate.swift"" from scratch?  I added a remote order processing system that use 3rd party tools, I learned what I needed from the tools and nothing more.

The balance is in being a full ""cut and paste"" programmer or everything from scratch programmer.

Back when slide out menus became popular, I got a 3rd party one and it crashed on my version of iOS.  I had to go in and modify the code to make it backward compatible.

The balance is about how much you should know about every little thing.  You have master-detail templates, do you really need to know how to hand craft one from scratch when you have templates from Apple?

Most agree that using 3rd party tools is great, but you really need to understand how the code works and how to change it. 

#####One of the key things to knowing if you're good is that you can debug and modify complex code that someone else wrote.

This is an important skill.  Xcode not only gives you all the options when you type it in, but allows you to make your own custom code snippets. 

You probably won't survive on EITHER end of the balance, hand crafting everything from scratch or ""cut n paste"" only.

There's another balance... leaning things that Xcode remembers for you... or learning APIs that make for apps that people love...

Here's a tip: if you push more towards learning the APIs, you'll get the other stuff over time because you'll see it over and over again.  If you spend too much time on the ""nuts and bolts"" you'll take a lot longer to make progress.  Progress is important.

Back in 2009/2010 I made the ""floating teapot"" on my device.  It's a teapot that can't tip over.  It was amazing.  THIS is where you find motivation.  You keep seeing the same code structures over and over, they'll start to sink in.

Example: I just did my first framework because of a tutorial and it was cool.  I didn't know how to do it correctly before...

Point: programming is non stop learning, balance what you learn between the nuts and bolts and the advanced stuff and you'll find less frustration.

I spent 2+ hours on the phone with MS to get to the point where I could import Outlook email into an iOS app...  I spend 3X that trying to get the same thing with Gmail.  It's not so easy to stay motivate if you always get lost in the nuts and bolts.",1521156055.0

Points_To_You,"For entry level or intern positions, I just look at their resumes and ask about the technologies, languages, or libraries they claimed they used in previous work experience or school projects. Basically if you put it on your resume, be able to talk about it intelligently. Sometimes I might throw in some questions about design patterns just to test how far their knowledge goes.

Other than that we just check soft skills. Speak clearly, make eye contact once in a while, be well written with good grammar in any email communications, be open to learning, be willing to listen (don't cut us off). It also helps if you ask about our company or the types of projects our team works on. Show an interest in what we do.

All of those languages also have many classes available on udemy as well as YouTube, you should be able to pick them up no problem.i have no doubt if you do that you'll have a solid enough resume to start looking for intern/junior developer positions.

Apple intends that the root viewController be a UITabBarViewController, and that each tab have, if needed, a UINavigationController, but you can tell the UINavigationController to hide its navbar until you need it. UISearchController needs it, so when you make the UISearchController visible, you also make its UINavigationController visible at the same time.

Also, this is one of those things that changed between iOS 9 and iOS 11. In one of those, the UISearchController will go in the navBar in and the other it goes in the header of the UITableView.

Supernova Studio helps you with the conversion of the UI from the design file in Sketch into files and code you can use in your iOS (or Android and React Native) applications. The result will not be a fully working application, at least not yet. You get the configured UI, with colors, images, font size etc. just like they were in the design, without you having to create everything piece by piece for hours and hours. You also get the layout, navigation, localization, animations and the ability to show the working UI to anyone on the Supernova Cloud, from a browser.

You will still have to write your model, network and logic code. These features are on our roadmap, but not yet available. You have to make your own decision if that is worth it to you. There's a free trial to help you with the decision.

Here's an example output code from our tutorial series: https://github.com/Supernova-Studio/spacebook-exported-code",1520956556.0

That's not what the majority of them (Supernova included from what I can tell) try to do. They aim to abstract the mundane task of recreating a UI from a Design Guideline you get from your designers so you can focus on the logic of your application. Personally I think generating the logic as well is just not something that can be done reliably at this point because there are too many unknowns and differences between projects.

Have a look at Supernova Studio's GitHub repository, for example the generated [LoginVC](https://github.com/Supernova-Studio/spacebook-exported-code/blob/master/iOS/Spacebook/Classes/Controllers/LoginVC.swift). There you will see that all they do is set up the ViewController from a UI perspective. Everything else is left to the developer.

Generating code from a UI tool is even older than the report tools.  They used to have templates that you'd change for whatever language you wanted.  The real problems are maintaining the code that comes out and applying things like custom animations and other 3rd party tools.

Look at some simple things like a slide out menu.  What do you do if you find a really cool slide out menu that you want to use?

What happens when you want to change the UI because of some new UI trend.

Past that, you have the issue of how you like your code to be written.  If you want it done a certain way, how do you change that?

Say you don't create unit tests, and you have a really complex app. When you make a change to any component, you have to worry that there will be unintended side effects that won't show up during testing, but will show up out in the wild.

But if you unit test from the beginning, all of your unit tests as a whole represent the gold standard for how your component should behave. No matter what change I make, if the component still passes all the unit tests, then it's behaving exactly as intended.

It's especially difficult with generics, including generic protocols and containers. The compiler will work hard at figuring out those missing types and slow everything down, sometimes including Xcode's GUI.

I want to add a note related to what u/ryanredditthings had to say on the matter. For simple type inference this is usually not an issue, it's really the more complex examples that cause trouble. If you have issues with long compiles or Xcode takes a long time in figuring out your code then try providing the types rather than having it infer them.

wavy_lines,"I think to understand the answer you have to understand [Apple's approach to performance][0], specially when it comes to iOS.

[0]: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/PerformanceOverview/DevelopingForPerf/DevelopingForPerf.html

Much of the industry treats performance like a secondary or tertiary concern. I cannot make a bold statement such as ""Apple puts performance at the top of their priority!"". I've been hearing some negative experiences people were having with performance on Apple products.

However, let's compare with Android:

Android relies on a Java-based virtual machine, where memory is managed with ""garbage collection"". This means there's a thing that runs in the background, and can pause the application at anytime, to scan for pointers and reclaim unreachable/unused ones.

Swift and Obj-C rely on reference counting, so that memory safety does not require pausing the application.

I've found that people who care about performance really care about not hiding ""expensive"" operations. It's one of the reasons why many game developers do not use ""getter"" and ""setter"" functions. Functions calls implies that ""there's possibly something expensive here"". Simple statements (not involving function calls) are supposed to be trivial and straight forward.

`str[x]` is supposed to be O(1); a constant time operation, and you _know_ how it's implemented: add x to the base string (well, after multiplying it by the size of one element).

Is it easier to read and write than `str.index(str.startIndex, offsetBy: 10)`? Yes. But it hides the performance cost.

People coming from say, a Python/Ruby/JavaScript background generally have an impression that this is a case of a trivial/negligible/cheap operation.

But if iOS was programmed with this mindset, it would probably be unbearable slow, and probably never take off in the first place.

hitoyoshi,"Well, it was kind of inevitable when you think about what Apple are (probably) doing over the longer term.

In my opinion, over the last few years, Apple has been slowly migrating us to a modern framework. (Marzipan.)

It doesn’t take long to see that, although great in its day, obj-c and cocoa are looking a little long in the tooth.

Lack of type-safety; the archaic syntax for blocks just to make a closure; the mix of c and obj-c in some frameworks, NotificationCenter, etc.

It needed complete modernisation. It couldn’t do it all in one go though, that would be far too jarring.

Stage 1 - The Compiler:
First it had to have a compiler infrastructure (LLVM) that could take all these disparate languages (c, c++, obj-c, obj-c++) and allow for the addition of new language features. It could then add new features to the existing languages (blocks, etc.) to pave the the way for the migration to a new language.

Stage 2 - The Language:
With LLVM in place Apple could begin the work of introducing a new language (Swift) rich with modern features, usable at high/low level, but that could also interoperate with the old language (obj-c) naturally in order to facilitate the use of legacy frameworks. This isn’t perfect (see OP) but is pretty impressive.

Stage 3 - The Framework:
With the language in place I think now is the time that we’ll see the introduction of a modern application framework that replaces Cocoa.  What this looks like, I don’t know, but from the rumored ‘Marzipan,’ we know it will likely be the same framework across desktop and mobile and will more than likely be designed to be a perfect counterpart to swift.

With that in mind, The odd obj-c specifier during the transition is pretty impressive!

I think Apple have had this planned out over a long time. In some ways it’s more impressive to me than the transition from PowerPC to x86.

Just like with Swift you have to specify with attributes that you are doing this. As more code was moved to .Net the need to use older unsafe code became less common. This is how you transition from an old code base to a new one.,1520789064.0

> ##Access Levels
> 
> Swift provides five different *access levels* for entities within your code. These access levels are relative to the source file in which an entity is defined, and also relative to the module that source file belongs to.
> 
> - *Open access* and *public access* enable entities to be used within any source file from their defining module, and also in a source file from another module that imports the defining module. You typically use open or public access when specifying the public interface to a framework. The difference between open and public access is described below.
> - *Internal access* enables entities to be used within any source file from their defining module, but not in any source file outside of that module. You typically use internal access when defining an app’s or a framework’s internal structure.
> - *File-private* access restricts the use of an entity to its own defining source file. Use file-private access to hide the implementation details of a specific piece of functionality when those details are used within an entire file.
> - *Private access* restricts the use of an entity to the enclosing declaration, and to extensions of that declaration that are in the same file. Use private access to hide the implementation details of a specific piece of functionality when those details are used only within a single declaration.

Your main alternative to `fileprivate`would be to put those files into a module of their own and set access to the default, `internal`.

dancemonkey,"I second what's already been said (Hacking With Swift is great for beginners, and continues to be a great resource once you no longer consider yourself a ""beginner"").

Just to offer my two cents, but my go-to project when I'm learning a new language is always Hangman. The rules are simple and almost universally understood, so you can just dive right in and start coding without losing momentum trying to reinvent the wheel with a brand new game or project.

For Swift you have multiple ways you can choose to allow the user to pick a letter (26 buttons, one for each letter? A letter picker wheel? A textfield where they just type it in?). You can have the words pulled from a static text file, from an online API, or have one player enter a word and the other guess. For the hangman itself you can use Spritekit and load new images with each wrong guess, use simple stick-figures drawn with ASCII text, 3D with SceneKit, whatever you like. 

Most importantly though Hangman gives you an opportunity to use almost every Swift (or whatever) language element you've learned. I think it's a great all-around project because it can be as simple or as complex as you like, and you get to just jump in and start coding with minimal pre-planning.",1520705478.0

Examples:

- Share from Google Chrome → Read Later (Chromium is open source. [This may be helpful](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/f18e79d901f56154f80eea1e2218544285e62623/ios/chrome/browser/ui/activity_services/reading_list_activity.mm)).

While share extension is also a perfectly fine and valid way of achieving what you want, it introduces few UX issues IMO:

1. User has to manually enable share extension (even if the content is being shared by your app)
2. The order of Share extension is not determined by host app or container app.
3. The share extension shares completely different context than the container app, so basically it gets little tricky to send messages back to the app once action has been completed.

dinorinodino,"What you’re talking about is called the architecture of an app. As with most things programming, there’s a lot of them. 

Apple uses MVC (Model-View-Controller) and you should too, at least in the beginning. 
MVC in a nutshell: 

-	a model is anything you use to feed data to and from your UI, e.g. classes, structs, databases, online APIs...
-	a view is any component displayed directly to the user, i.e. UI
-	a controller mediates between the two

Models should be “dumb” and have zero knowledge of what kind of UI they will be used with. Views should be kind of “dumb” — they should be able to manage themselves, their size, and delegate any actual model or controller like responsibilities to some other object. Controllers then fetch data from your model and display it in your views. 

This is probably not totally accurate, and you should definitely check out [Apple’s docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/MVC.html), and Stanford’s CS193P videos. And try making something a bit simpler until you “get it”. ",1520645314.0

Look who's now considered normal and standard.

Anyway, after years of doing this, I really dislike using any dynamic language for any purpose what so ever. Python is nice for small one-shot scripts. But it's a mistake to use it for a serious project.

Swift is about the most pleasant language (I know of) that can be used for general purpose applications. I think its performance is more than satisfactory (python is terribly slow).

So yea definitely Swift is a great language for server side applications.

If I wanted to squeeze every ounce of performance, maybe I'd go with D (with no gc, and with custom allocators, etc).

However, if you're concerned about what other people in the industry will think, well, yea, I don't think it's in high demand _yet_. Not sure if it will be, but why should that matter? Use the best tool for the job, not the tool that other people think you should use.",1520518334.0

Still, it's certainly worthwhile for people to try using it there.  That's how flaws and limitations get found, and resolved.

You can go the Apple route of Core Data, or you can pick an embedded database like SQLite, or if your data is super tiny, you can persist it to a file (or multiple files) using JSON.

Ultimately, the world is your oyster - and without knowing what kind of data you're storing, and how you'd like to manage it, it's impossible to make a recommendation.

I'm just going to address general code quality.  I read your server code.  Lots of raw SQL.  Sometimes raw SQL is the best (or only!) way.  But it is error prone and takes a long time to write.  In general I'd say your server code has about 5-10x more code than it needs because there is no abstraction.  No model.  No helpers to represent the semantics at a higher level.  I think you will benefit from learning Django because it has models that map to the database and simplifies your interface to the database.

I have to say the same thing about your ios app.  You write too much low level code and could move up a level in abstraction to get things done and have a much smaller more understandable program.  You should have a set of models and model provider that abstracts away the underlying storage (looks like you just fetch stuff in from the network - no local storage - no caching) and filtering/access.

Secondly, the model should periodically fetch the data from the source with a timer. Once it does so it can fire off an update to the cells with whatever method and timing you choose.

You can choose between several design patterns for interacting between the view and the model. Two of the most common are Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM). MVC is a classic and the one Apple recommends but it has its flaws and a lot of people now recommend MVVM.

Here's a few guides on the design patterns:

- [Apple MVC](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/MVC.html)
- [How not to get desperate with MVVM implementation](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/how-to-use-a-model-view-viewmodel-architecture-for-ios-46963c67be1b)
- [MVVM in iOS](https://medium.com/@azamsharp/mvvm-in-ios-from-net-perspective-580eb7f4f129)

clawesome,"There's a bunch of different ways you could do it.  Personally, I would create a recursive function that takes in an array of views and a completion block.  Within that function, pop off a view from the array, call animateWithDuration:animations:completion on that view and within the completion block, you would call the recursive function again but without the view you just popped from the array and passing the original completion block to it.

    func animateViews(views: [UIView], completionHandler: (() -> Void)? ) {

        var tempViews = views
        if let lastView = tempViews.popLast() {

            UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5, animations: {
                // logic to determine animations
            }, completion: { (finished) in

        } else if let completionHandler = completionHandler {
            completionHandler()
        }
    }    

Then you can call the function and pass in a completion block to know when it's done.  You could use that completion block to perform another set of animations after the first set completes.

    animateViews(views: views, completion: {
        // animating views finished, can call second set
        // of animations from here

    let pinAnnotationView: MKPinAnnotationView = MKPinAnnotationView() 
    pinAnnotationView.annotation?.coordinate

See more [in the docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkpinannotationview)

**2)** The thing that goes on top of the pin is called the `detailCalloutAccessoryView` and has both a `title` and `subtitle` property which you should consider using before you go to build your own. Docs on this can be seen [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkannotation/1429522-title). If you do wish to go and create your own callout view, there is no readily available API for this, instead, you will need to subclass `MKAnnotation` or `MKPinAnnotationView` or one of the other annotation subclasses. Have a google for this, there's an abundance of tutorials out there.

**3)** Converting between coordinates and place names can be found in the docs under [Converting Between Coordinates and User-Friendly Place Names](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/converting_between_coordinates_and_user_friendly_place_names).

silver_belt,"Objective-C developer here.

I believe your issue is that you're trying to access instance variables from within a class (static) function.  You can't return `self.persistentContainer` because the static function exists outside of an instance scope.  Also, your original code would give every DataController its own NSPersistentContainer, which doesn't seem like your intention if your static method tries to return the same one each time.

The solution is to instantiate your NSPersistentContainer in the static method, and have the instance methods use that one.

I'm probably going to butcher your code, but try this instead:

    // static variable that implicitly creates the NSPersistentContainer
    static var container: NSPersistentContainer {
        let container = NSPersistentContainer(name: ""CoreDataTest"")
        container.loadPersistentStores(completionHandler: { (storeDescription, error) in
            if let error = error as NSError? {
                fatalError(""Unresolved error \(error), \(error.userInfo)"")
            }
        })
        return container
    }()

    // convenience static method that will grab the container's context; it's in the same scope because both are static
    static var viewContext: NSManagedObjectContext {
        return self.persistentContainer.viewContext
    }

    // convenience instance method that returns the static variable, accessible using the DataController class itself
    var persistentContainer: NSPersistentContainer = {
        return DataController.persistentContainer

the bad news: iOS internships and entry-level positions seem extremely hard to come by, especially if you want to target a specific type of field/company/app. i would guess that this means they're extremely competitive when it comes to applying as well.

everyone I know who started doing iOS in 2014 or later (including myself) was initially hired into a different software role and then transitioned, or they applied through a large tech company's generic software engineer pipeline and landed in iOS through that.

soo my main advice aside from the objective c and storyboard thing is to also apply to lots of internships that arent specifically iOS, because the most important thing is to just get your first real software engineering job. i cant give you good advice for that because i dont know what i'd be looking for in a resume that isnt targeting iOS specifically

applishish,"I certainly appreciate new and simple alternatives, but a few things about this don't feel quite right.

> Now we support 1-to-many communication, but we doubled the number of lines, right? This is the main problem with NotificationCenter.

""Double"" sounds somewhat dubious:

 - It doesn't count the +100 lines of Channel.swift.
 - If we're allowed to disregard lines that don't need to be added again per-notification (this example has only one), we can also disregard a bunch of other lines.
 - It doesn't look quite idiomatic to me.  For example, a couple of lines do nothing but give a new name to a constant, which I assume is to keep lines short to fit on a blog.  Reformatting is great, but it shouldn't count as actual complexity.
 - Almost 25% is spent re-wrapping a `userInfo[""theme""]` back into a ThemeDidChangeNotification, which is then immediately unwrapped again.  Why not just check this in the guard directly?

The NC sample code looks artificially complex to me.  Not that NC couldn't be improved upon, but it's not *that* bad.  Besides, if we're counting net +/-, then using Channel is still +80.

> Channel implementation is less than 100 lines of code.

Short is good, but my primary goal is correctness, not size.  NC has a couple decades of real-world usage and bug fixes, and that counts for a lot.

100 lines of code doesn't seem like much, but with threads and generics and escaping blocks and weak refs (and no comments), this is not exactly simple, and it's not clear to me that it's correct.  I'm not sure how this would ever work, for example:

    for invalidIndex in invalidIndexes {
        subscriptions.remove(at: invalidIndex)
    }

and that's not even the complex part of it!

The author never says what about NotificationCenter ""always looked a bit inconsistent to me"", or why it's a good thing that ""We can finally stop using NotificationCenter"".  It's well-documented, and it works, and that's table stakes for any proposed replacement.

Perhaps add check for double removal. In the `Channel.broadcast()` function. I think there is a problem when there is nested broadcast's happening and one of the subscriptions being nilled. This may cause double removal of subscriptions. I haven't tried out the code, so I may be wrong.

Jman012,"There’s a couple approaches, if I’m understanding your question correctly. 

\1. Two sub ViewControllers

Depending on which cell you press in the main view controller, you can perform different argues that lead to different sub ViewControllers. In each one you can decide to use different cells and logic and whatnot. 

\2. Register multiple cells in one table view

Your main view controller always leads to your one sub view controller. The main tells the sub that it’s using a certain type of data, either by a boolean or an enumeration. Your sub registers two different types of cells, and based on your boolean/enumeration it dequeues different ones by the different identifier. 

Choosing will be the difficult part. You have to ask yourself about duplicate code. Is the rest of the sub view controller the same or drastically different? Do the cells have the same inputs or not? Do the different cells lead to different actions? Are you presenting the table view or other components differently? Ideally you want to minimize the amount of duplicate code that results from this. If you feel like you’re making one sub view controller that has two major modes and it feels like you’re writing two entirely different view controllers into one, it may be better to just write two ViewControllers.

applishish,"The buried lede: ""what happens if this functions signature is changed?""

Yes, if you change your source code, your program will behave differently.  It's never going to be possible to design a type system so strict that it can catch every possible error, including other valid programs.  Is this a significant one?  I've never heard of it before.

I particularly dislike reusing the ""override"" keyword for protocol conformance.  It's not clear if the intent is to require ""override"" to override a default implementation (in which case callers have to be aware of what protocol extensions are in effect, which has strange effects on source compatibility), or if it's repurposing the word ""override"" for all protocol conformance (which is not what the word means, since there's nothing it's overriding).  Neither one sounds like a great idea to me.

[This](https://gist.github.com/erica/14283fe18254489c1498a7069b7760c4) is a much more well thought-out proposal.  Instead of ""override"", it adds a couple more keywords, so at least it's accurate.

thisischemistry,"There are two ways to refer to a swift `Array` type. One is `Array<Type>` and the other is `[Type]`. They are pretty much equivalent. `Type` is the type of element that can be contained in the array. `[Int]` is an `Array` of `Int` objects.

When you follow a type declaration with `()` you are calling its `init()` method.

Normally the full declaration would be something like:

    var awesomeArray: [Int] = [Int]()

You can do it like this to indicate the same thing:

    var awesomeArray: [Int] = []

Or this way:

    var awesomeArray = [Int]()

All of those are equivalent, they declare a mutable variable named `awesomeArray` that holds an `Array` of `Int` and then they assign to it a new `Array` of `Int` which doesn't yet contain anything. In the last one the type of the variable is inferred.

Now this statement:

    var awesomeArray = Array(originalArray[0..<array.count/2])

Uses this type method of the `Array` type:

    init<S>(_ s: S) where Element == S.Element, S : Sequence

This is a generic method that takes any `Sequence` where `S.Element` is the same as the array's `Element` you are creating. You create an `ArraySlice<Int>` with the statement `originalArray[0..<array.count/2]` so it understands the `Element` is `Int`. Since the compiler knows that `S.Element` is `Int` it creates an `Array<Int>`.",1520109852.0

But as noted above, without declaring what type of array it is, it’s just a variable that could hold an array.  But at this point, it has only be told the type. It is NOT an empty array, as it hasn’t been initialized yet. 

The second one, meanwhile, is declaring awesomeArray to be an array of integers, and it is specifically initialized to an empty array. ",1520105355.0

kedio10,"While trying to wrap my head around how to implement MVVM in the MVC world of UIKit I read this [article](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/mvvm/). While very interesting I think that the most valuable part is this [schema](https://www.objc.io/images/issue-13/mvvm-b27768df.png).


The view part of MVVM is actually the UIViewController and its UIView. The UIViewController is actually just a dumb router passing user interaction to the ViewModel and telling views to update based on the ViewModel state.


The ViewModel holds the Models, Services and all logic required to compute the information to display based on user inputs. Typically providing methods to receive inputs and presenting variables of primitive data like strings.


In the special case of RxSwift both input (Ex: stream of button tap) and output (Ex: stream of string to display) would be Observables.  


As per your question, exposing an Observable or a Driver would be more style related. As long as it is consistent throughout the application using one over the other will not make much difference since Drivers just are a special case of Observables.


In my experience transforming the streams from the user's inputs to display information will become messy pretty fast. You could have a look at [ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift) which simplify application states. With this, your ViewModel would take streams of user inputs (Observable) and use this to update the state which your views are already bound to. This makes the flow unidirectional and can greatly improve readability.


This is my current understanding with my limited experience of MVVM and RxSwift.

reddioment,"ViewModel is the **UIKit independent view representation**. The ViewModel should contain every piece of information that the View needs without any conversion. So basically in the ViewModel you only use Strings and UIImages because those don't need to be converted (unlike Int and Bool and others).

Heres an example:

    struct AlbumCellViewModel {
	    let title: String
	    let releaseDate: String
	    let genre: String
	    let artwork: UIImage
    }

    extension AlbumCellViewModel {
	    init(album: Album) {
		    self.artwork = album.artworkState == .downloaded ? album.artwork! : #imageLiteral(resourceName: ""AlbumPlaceholder"")
		    self.title = album.censoredName
		    self.genre = album.primaryGenre.name
		
		    let formatter = DateFormatter()
		    formatter.locale = Locale.current
		    formatter.dateFormat = ""MMM dd, yyyy""
		
		    self.releaseDate = formatter.string(from: album.releaseDate)
	    }
    }

And in the ViewController I have a func like so:

    func configure(with album: Album) {
		    let viewModel = AlbumDetailViewModel(album: album)
		
		    albumTitleLabel.text = viewModel.title
		    albumGenreLabel.text = viewModel.genre
		    albumReleaseDateLabel.text = viewModel.releaseDate

davidsiegel," [quicktype](https://app.quicktype.io/?l=swift&initializers=false&alamofire=true) can now generate statically-typed Alamofire response handlers and Codable structs from JSON. If you use Alamofire in Swift, we'd love some feedback.

For example, given the JSON:

    { ""name"": ""David"", ""lucky number"": 7 }

quicktype generates a Codable:

    struct Person: Codable {
        let name: String
        let luckyNumber: Int

        enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
            case name
            case luckyNumber = ""lucky number""
        }
    }

And some Alamofire extensions:

    extension DataRequest {
        // ...

        @discardableResult
        func responsePerson(
            queue: DispatchQueue? = nil,
            completionHandler: @escaping (DataResponse<Person>) -> Void)
            -> Self {
                return responseDecodable(queue: queue, completionHandler: completionHandler)
        }
    }

Which allow you to do a statically-typed request like:

     Alamofire.request(url).responsePerson{ response in
         if let person = response.result.value {
             print(person.luckyNumber)

Maybe you start with one card face up on the table (let’s call it the ace of spades), when you present another view controller/playing card (queen of hearts) you put it on top of the other card on the table.

This isn’t good because the table (memory) can only hold so many cards and using present creates copies of cards and this gets pretty hairy pretty quickly.

itaiferber,"The answers provided by /u/thisischemistry and /u/bmbowdish will work, but instead of making a struct with all-optional properties, the recommended solution is to provide an `enum` instead:

    struct Answer : Decodable {
        let id: Int
        let text: String
    }

    struct Article : Decodable {
        let id: Int

    }

    struct Video : Decodable {
        let id: Int

        case video(Video)

        private enum CodingKeys : String, CodingKey {
            case answer, article, video
        }

        public init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
            let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
            do {
                self = .answer(try container.decode(Answer.self, forKey: .answer))
            } catch DecodingError.keyNotFound {
                do {
                    self = .article(try container.decode(Article.self, forKey: .article))
                } catch DecodingError.keyNotFound {
                    self = .video(try container.decode(Video.self, forKey: .video))
                }
            }
        }
    }

This way you can't end up with a type that has no content, unlike the other solutions. With this, you can now have

    let decoder = JSONDecoder()
    let feed = try decoder.decode([Entry].self, from: data)

If you want a little bit more fanciness, you can also add

    struct Feed : Decodable {
        let entries: [Entry]

        public init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
            let container = try decoder.singleValueContainer()
            entries = try container.decode([Entry].self)
        }
    }

so you can then `try decoder.decode(Feed.self, from: data)`.

With that approach, it's also easy to add

    public var videos: [Video] {
        return entries.flatMap {
            guard case .video(let video) = $0 else { return nil }
            return video

    }

This is probably the easiest way to deal with your structure. You might want to look at mixing in some protocols just so you can access properties in a type-safe manner. For example:

    /** It has an `id` property. */
    protocol IDable {
      var id: Int { get }
    }

    struct Answer: IDable, Codable {
      let id: Int

thisischemistry,"1. You declare a property like that because you need to defer its availability to start until after something else has happened, but by the time it's in use it will be completely constructed and available. In other words, the `Optional` property might be `nil` at some point but it can be treated as non-`nil` by the time it will be used. Thus, it's an `Optional` that can be used just like a non-`Optional`.

  For example:

    `@IBOutlet weak var bigRed: UIButton!`

  It's declared like that because the class that contains it might be instantiated at any point, before or after the `UIButton`. However, you guarantee that the property will only be accessed *after* the button is instantiated. This is often the case when using the Interface Builder, you'll create a storyboard or NIB with some objects that get loaded and you can't guarantee the order they will be loaded. However, by the time you get to your view's `viewDidLoad()` everything is guaranteed to be in place.

1. Not long, they are basically along the same lines as start pointers in modern C++ or how people with discipline handle C pointers. You have some rules to access a pointer that helps you avoid using them when they are set to nonsensical values - objects that haven't been allocated yet or which have been deallocated. It's really not that much baggage and they save you *so* much time in safety. You'd understand what I mean the first time you have to debug some bad pointer leading you off in the the realm of undefined behavior...

1. Like this on [`String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string)?

1. Anything with a NS or UI or CG or whatever is there because of namespacing. If you have two types with the same name then they can clash so by putting a few letters related to their framework in front you make them unique. It comes from the old days of Objective-C. In fact, NS stands for ""NextStep"" - the original operating system and environment that used those frameworks.

  When they came up with Swift they mostly dropped that convention for the core stuff but they allowed it to be ""bridged"" to the older names for compatibility with Objective-C. So Swift has a type `String` that can be ""bridged"" over to `NSString`. When you do that the compiler translates between the two types for you.

  There's a few reasons to use `NSString` over `String`: a few methods declared on one over the other, or you might need the NS version to pass a value to an Objective-C framework. You should stick to the non-NS types if they do the job for you.

1. I'll have to think on this one. It's probably just a matter of time and exposure, eventually you get used to the way Apple does it and the other ways might seem foreign.

1. Protocols and Interfaces share some ideas and have some similarities but they do things their own way. One name is not necessarily better than the other and I wouldn't assume that's why the name ""Protocol"" was picked.

3) Class references in the documentation.

4) Classes prefixed with NS come from Objective-C. More specifically they come from NextStep. You'll encounter fewer of them as the language evolves and the core frameworks are ported or have their APIs bridged in a nicer way. You'll also see CG like in CGFloat from CoreGraphics and CA like in CADisplayLink from CoreAnimation. They'll probably disappear with time.

It seemed like the logical simplification of what other languages did.  What exactly do you propose instead?  The Java situation, where all reference types are implicitly nullable, and no value types are allowed to be?  The C situation, where every type is just some naked memory?  No null values in the language at all, and everybody has to invent their own context-dependent placeholder, like NSNotFound?

> Why are there so many variants of basic classes? E.g., you have not just String but NSString and other kinds.

The major difference there is that String is a struct, not a class.  Also, NSString was, like many NeXTStep classes, designed back in the 1980's.  Things have changed a bit since then, and there's only so far you can stretch an API before you need to overhaul it.

The risk of it happening to users should be extremely low because even the most basic sanity testing of your app will notice the bug. And whenever it happens, you're going to get a crash on exactly that line, so more detailed error reporting isn't necessary.

On the other hand, if your UIButtons are built dynamically by code, it changes all of the above analysis. The cause may be a subtle runtime issue. The repro steps may require other conditions, like scrolling in certain patterns or having certain data to display. The risk of it happening to users is significantly higher, since your own testing might miss it. And when it happens, a symbolicated crash may not be enough to figure out how to reproduce it.",1519856523.0

jasamer,"Swift's generics are ""invariant"", that means, a generic type `A<B>` cannot be converted to `A<C>`, even if `B` is a subtype of `C`. 

This is very annoying.

The only thing that might help you is something called type erasure, which is just absolutely fugly in Swift and you shouldn't use it if you can avoid it.

Edit: ignore the below, it's not actually needed because the protocol can be used as a type in this case anyway...

The idea is that instead of `UserType`, you use a concrete implementation called `AnyUser`, that gets the properties from a wrapped instance of another `UserType`. This way, you can return a `RequestHandler<BaseResponse<AnyUser>>`, which can contain a `User1` or a `User2`.

 Unfortunately, I do not know if you can actually use that in your specific code, because I do not know the implementation of `self.request()`. 

Anyhow, this would be the code for writing a type-erased `AnyUser` class:

    protocol UserType {
        var firstName: String { get }
    }
    
    // A non-generic ""AnyUser"" to use in place of ""UserType"".
    class AnyUser: UserType {
        var firstName: String { fatalError() } // We can't actually return anything here, that is why we have a subclass below.
    }
    
    // The subclass is generic, but the parent class is not - by having `AnyUser`, we ""type-erase"" the generic type parameter of ConcreteAnyUser.
    class ConcreteAnyUser<T: UserType>: AnyUser {
        var wrapped: T
        override var firstName: String { return wrapped.firstName } // Yeah, you'd have to do that for every property/method in UserType...
        
        init(_ wrapped: T) {
            self.wrapped = wrapped
        }
    }

digitalburro,"> is the facebook access token the never changing? 

Read up on how Facebook tokens work here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens#usertokens

In the case of the Facebook app SDKs, the access token you work with is a 'Long-Term' token and has a life span of up to 60 days.  

> Because when I logout of my app or uninstall and reinstall it, the app still recognizes that I have signed in with facebook 

That is correct.  The Facebook SDK writes the Facebook access token to the iOS keychain and that value persists across app installs.  As for logging out of your app, you have to also make sure you call the logout method from the Facebook SDK, otherwise the token will still be persisted.  

I can't speak to what additional affects Firebase adds to the mix, but I would suspect there isn't much to it -- Facebook Auth should return a unique Facebook User ID.  I would speculate that is a unique identifier in the Firebase database.  ",1519789908.0
itaiferber,"The first works because it's actually a method call: `Int(str)` is equivalent to `Int.init(str)`, and `Int` offers an [`init?(_: String)` initializer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/int/2927504-init) which takes a string and attempts to parse an `Int` out of it, returning `nil` if it fails.

The second does not work because it's an actual cast, which checks the type of the value you're casting at runtime, but (usually) performs no conversion. `str` is a `String`, not an `Int`, so the cast fails, and you get `nil`.

Unlike C-based languages (including Objective-C) where casting is the primary way of converting between types, Swift favors `init`-based type conversions over casts. Casting is a complicated feature because of bridging (some Swift types _do_ convert to other types through a cast, primarily for compatibility with Objective-C), but overall, the primary use is in downcasting from one type to a more specific, precisely compatible type.

For disparate types such as `Int` and `String`, it's customary to provide an initializer which performs the conversion.",1519782778.0

As an aside, personally, I use `willDisplayCell` for preloading logic, but there is something you should be aware of: if your user scrolls to the last cell you’ll initiate a new fetch request; if they then scroll up past the last cell and scroll back to the bottom, `willDisplayCell` will get called again and, if the current request hasn’t completed, you’re going to fetch more images again, which means (assuming you’re not loading images randomly) you’ll have the same data twice in a row—unless you stop new requests while another one is in progress.

OK, but what does it *do*?  Why are you writing a program in the first place, if the data never changes, and the objects don't do anything?  Wouldn't a spreadsheet be easier?

Are we keeping inventory of robots, or writing microcontrollers for a swarm of them, or simulating the efficiency of their power supplies?  Even the exact same physical object could have dozens of possible perfectly valid data structures, depending on what we want our program to do.

Then the article goes on to shuffle around the initializer parameters, and claim that this has benefits.  Well, maybe.  But again, without knowing what these Robot objects are to be used for, it's impossible to see the benefits here.  Looking at the claims:

 - ""Transparency"": Was it at all difficult to see the dependencies of the class before?  Why are we making assumptions about behavior, when it has none?

sixtypercenttogether,"Honestly, this is a classic iOS interview question, so it’s not too hard to solve.

First thing, you will need some sort of local cache of images so that you aren’t requesting the same image every time the cell comes on screen. To start this can be just a dictionary of the NSURL for the remote to the UIImage instance. Make it a class property on the cell class.

When you need to load the remote image, first check the cache to see if you have it already. If so, set the UIImageView image and you’re done. Otherwise, you need to request it.

Use a NSURLSession data task with the appropriate URL and supply a completion block. But before doing so, store this URL as a property on the cell class so you know what URL this cell is currently fetching. Now, inside the data task completion block, you need to check that the URL the cell is loading is still the same by comparing it to the URL in he NSURLResponse. If they are the same the. You know you can set the image to the UIImageView. If not, then you know that the cell has been reused before the response was received. Either way at this point you can save the received image into the cache mentioned above.

This should get you off the ground, but there are a few more things you can do to make this more robust:
* implement this functionality as a category on UIImageView. That way you can use it for other cell classes and what not
* synchronize access to the cache, since this is mutable state shared between threads
* bound the size of the cache, using LRU or some other metric",1519578206.0

So many people abuse the forced unwrap operator because they don't know better or they don't care.

Things I would consider would be, how long it would take me to do the project.  I generally have a minimum billing period of 10 hours no matter what, but if I needed 15 hours to complete your project, I would quote for 15 hours of time.  More details about the project would help me to decide that.  If I quoted 15 hours, and you (as the customer) changed what you wanted the end product to do, then there could be additional fees.


Other things I would consider, would be how much support you want or need after the app was deployed.  With no back end coded needed, any changes would have to be done in your app and redeployed.  Would you want me to do that or the next developer?  If I need to, then there will be additional fees.


If you do not have a design document already made, then we would have to have a back-and-forth discussion to create a design document.  This is a highly recommended item you have no matter who you hire.  It should detail how your app works, possible layouts of every page in the app, etc.  If I help you, my fee is generally $10 US an hour, with a minimum fee of $20.


So after the design document is created, I would charge $30 US an hour to code and deliver, so my minimum fee would be around $300 with your app delivered the next day.  Of course that is depending on a lot of of variables.


One thing to keep in mind is that the developer could be working on other projects, the developer may work on your project 2 hours a day for a week, so make sure you ask the developer how long it will take.

Because the `Any` type (which a lookup from `allHeaderFields` returns) is not the same as the `Data` type. For that matter, neither is the `String` type which the Set-Cookie field can be downcast to. Additionally, `String`'s internal representation (IIRC UTF16) is not the same as the utf8 representation that your `String(data: encoding:)` bit uses.  This is seen in this example from the String section of the current Developer docs.

Would you like to elaborate?

Unless your layouts are trivial I don't see many benefits to doing things in code. The lack of variables is probably the one of two major drawbacks that I've found in practice, and that mostly only matters during prototyping. I have xibs with 100k+ lines, I can't imagine how unreadable that would be in code. God forbid you need to use basic auto layout features that the VFL doesn't support, like centering.

The other major drawback is the opaque id attributes, and the way that IB deals with structural changes (such as moving a subview to a different superview), making branch-based development an utter bitch. Again, unless your layouts are trivial, that's not going to be all that much easier when your layout is in the form of a monstrously huge source file",1519362401.0

As of 2014, SnapChat was being run on Google App Engine - http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-is-built-on-googles-cloud-2014-1?IR=T

Not sure if there are specific applications in wide use for chat back-ends, but I would say that ""service-oriented architecture"" is probably the closest to a generic ""best practice"" that is common across all large tech companies.

At this large scale, there's no monolithic back-end powering everything - each part of the pipeline gets broken into smaller self-contained services that pass data between each other and for each service to have a dedicated team assigned.

SOA allows services to scale in a 'mesh' formation where each service can be scaled up and down independently, as needed. It adds a lot of complexity that is required at large scale but is just overhead if you don't need it - stick with a simple, monolithic, off-the-shelf back end as long as you can & throw more (cheap, commodity) hardware at the problem until it becomes necessary to hire a (expensive, hard to hire & retain) development team to refactor the application to a service-oriented architecture.

thisischemistry,"This might be a bit  better and is more generic than what is at that link. It looks like that's a naive implementation of [this pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort#Top-down_implementation_using_lists).

The code I'm posting here.

- Is updated to Swift 4.

- It replaces mutating arrays with using indexes and slices, possibly saving creating a new copy with every mutation.

- It will also work on anything that adopts `RangeReplaceableCollection`, not just `Array`. 

- I avoided using `inout` since many times that just makes a copy and returns a copy. Thus there is no real savings over simply returning the new object, it really just makes the call more difficult to grasp.

A few things still bug me about my solution:

- The need to have all parameters be `RangeReplaceableCollection`, it's a real pain to just use `Collection` because there's no way to construct an object through that protocol.

- The need to explicitly construct a new object instead of passing on the split in this sort of call:

 `mergeSort(list: T(list[..<mid]))`

 This is because, for some reason, `list[..<mid]` returns `T.SubSequence` and can't easily be turned into `RangeReplaceableCollection` or `RangeReplaceableSlice`.

The code:

    func merge<T: RangeReplaceableCollection>(left: T, right: T) -> T where
      T.Element: Comparable {
        guard !left.isEmpty else { return right }
        guard !right.isEmpty else { return left }
        var result = T()

        var leftPos = left.startIndex
        var rightPos = right.startIndex

        while leftPos < left.endIndex && rightPos < right.endIndex {
          let (leftValue, rightValue) = (left[leftPos], right[rightPos])
          if leftValue <= rightValue {
            result.append(leftValue)
            leftPos = left.index(after: leftPos)
          } else {
            result.append(rightValue)
            rightPos = right.index(after: rightPos)
          }
        }

        result.append(contentsOf: left[leftPos...])
        result.append(contentsOf: right[rightPos...])

        return result
    }

    func mergeSort<T: RangeReplaceableCollection>(list: T) -> T where
      T.Element: Comparable {
        guard list.count > 1 else { return list }

        let mid = list.index(list.startIndex, offsetBy: list.count / 2)
        let left = mergeSort(list: T(list[..<mid]))
        let right = mergeSort(list: T(list[mid...]))

        return merge(left: left, right: right)
    }

I have yet to see it. We've done mutation testing on libs but we've yet to find a real bug. But getting to 100% test coverage has exposed lots of bugs, and that's a prerequisite for mutation testing (ish)...

If you look at the file that gets pulled in with `import UIKit` (command-click on the word ""UIKit"" and select ""jump to definition"") you'll see all the modules it imports. The first one is `Foundation`. Thus, UIKit includes everything in Foundation.

It's a good practice to only import what you absolutely need, since you can have name clashes and importing takes time and memory during compiling. For example, I have a project with a file that does `import Foundation.NSGeometry` because all that I use in that file is `NSPoint` and `NSRect`. By putting a period in there the compiler first looks for the Foundation module, then looks for the submodule ""NSGeometry"" in that module.

* Many tutorials have trouble teaching Interface Builder and simply leave a lot as an ""exercise"" to the reader. Since it's often not the focus of the tutorial, it's similar to explaining Photoshop while focusing on teaching HTML & CSS.

* After dealing with corrupted IB files, I tried to stick to programmatically creating my interface. You have to be okay with it being ugly while learning how to code it. I'm not even certain all of the same features of IB are accessible just from code, so I eventually gave up and went back to IB when I had to do an interface overhaul.

* Don't try to mix and match. Creating some interface screens in code and others as IB is asking for extra integration work that there aren't a lot of tutorials for. Having been burned a few times, my gut is to stick with one or the other.

* The vector app of choice seems to be [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com ). It's not cheap, and it crashes a lot for me.

The solution here is after appending to this array, copy the array back by adding 'appDelegate.myModel.pocketMonsters = newPokemon'.

thisischemistry,"I find it hard to take an article seriously when it so badly ignores the tools of the language. For example, this function can be written much more succinctly:

    func find<T: Equatable>(item:T, inArray:[T]) -> Int?
    {
      var index:Int = 0
      var found = false

      while (index < inArray.count && found == false)
      {
        if item == inArray[index]
        {
          found = true
        }
        else
        {
          index = index + 1
        }
      }

      if found
      {
        return index
      }
      else
      {
        return nil
      }
    }

Like this:

    func find<T: Equatable>(item:T, inArray:[T]) -> Int? 
    {
      for arrayItem in inArray.enumerated() 
      {
        if item == arrayItem.element { return arrayItem.offset }
      }
      return nil
    }

That's 26 lines cut down to 8 with increased readability, less tests and operations, and avoiding manual handling of array indexes. The article should also mention that the method it's creating already exists in Swift: [`index(of:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/1689674-index)

The worst offense is the construct used in the article like this:

    if x == y then 
    { 
      return true
    } 
    else 
    { 
      return false 
    }

 You just tested for a `Bool` and returned a `Bool`, why not simply return the test?

    return x == y

Also, why write all these methods as free functions? Write them as an instance method and you can then reduce your method signature down to one parameter with increased readability and less chance of name collisions:

    let test = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    find(item: 2, inArray: test) // free function
    test.find(item: 2)           // instance method

Overall, it's an article that covers topics that already have a ton of articles written about them. It does so in a very clunky manner and teaches some bad habits that will produce long and hard-to-read code. I'm very surprised that a ""well-published author, software engineer, designer, and developer"" would write an article like this.

fluchtpunkt,"Have you looked at Apples ""Intro to App Development with Swift"" respectively ""App Development with Swift"" book? They are free on the iBook store.

They try to guide you through the development process that takes you from an idea to an app. Chapter 6.2 ""The Design Cycle"" of ""App Development with Swift"" might be interesting for you. 

But in the end the only way to learn how do real projects is to do a real project. You have to step away from step-by-step instructions and start thinking about solutions on your own. Don't worry, you will be able to pick up all the skills you need while doing it. 

So figure out an app you want to publish to the App Store, and start working on it. Don't create another throw-away app that will be trashed once you've learned enough. The goal should be to get it into a state where you wouldn't be ashamed if you publish it. Ideally you actually publish it, because you'll learn a lot of things during that process. 

Take your time to figure out what kind of app you want to create and what problem it should solve. Small utility apps work best as a first project. Don't aim for a full-fledged Twitter client or an office suite. If you have a hobby think about an app that would help you enjoy your hobby even more. Then build that. ",1518679759.0

1. loop
2. itteration
3. selection

Doing things like operator overload isn't actually needed for a program.  In fact, you can completely screw up your class design and have app your vars public and the program can still run.

You can program for 10 years and never do an operator overload and never get much into good class design or design patterns.  In Swift, you don't even need to do OO programming, you can do all function based.

Sub-par can be more about what the end user sees more than how the code is written.

You're saying that you want ""live"" data, and this is where it gets tricky. Now instead of the client making requests to a certain endpoint, the *client* now needs to subscribe to events from a broadcaster *(server)*. This type of data transfer is called [PubSub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern).

There are many protocols (ZMTP, XMPP, MQTT, Websockets to name a few) you can use to establish a publish subscribe pattern between a bunch of clients and a server. In the end what it all boils down to is a glorified TCP socket.

set that textFields .inputView property to be a UIPickerView or subclass of a UIPickerView

when the user taps the button get the method to call something like this

hiddenTriggeringTextField.becomesFirstResponder()

and the picker view should pop up like a keyboard

you might need to create a toolbar to put done and cancel buttons on and set the textFields.inputAccesoryView to be the toolbar so you can accept your choice and dismiss the pickerView

dont forget to call .sizeToFit() on the picker and the toolbar

When the other view is loaded via ViewWillAppear function, have it change that view based on the values of those global variables.

There is no need to get the two views to talk to each other, they will simply share data via a global class.

Using a global class is a subject of mixed debates, so you may read things that say to do it, and others that say to no do it.  I have used in past projects without an issue.

One tip I would have is that you never make more than one Global Class per project.

thisischemistry,"There's some terms here which have multiple meanings depending on what direction you're approaching it from.

In computer science an object can be any discrete value or block of values -  including functions, data structures, variables, or so on.

A narrower definition occurs in object-oriented programming. Here, objects are groups of related data and code that act on that data. They can be formal structures or loose groupings.

Another definition is in relational databases where an object is a row of related fields in a database.

Now it can get refined further when we talk about class-based object-oriented programming. In this the groups of data and code are wrapped up into a group called a ""class"". A set of values in memory is referred to as an ""instance""

In Swift a `Dictionary` is a collection of unique key-value pairs, codified in a structure. The `Dictionary` itself is a ""class"". It's called a `struct` in Swift because it has value semantics - it is always copied when transferred to another variable. Swift has several types of formal ""classes"", two of which are named `struct` and `class`.

A Dictionary might hold a set of data which, if related, might be called an object in a broad sense. So you have an object (class-based object-oriented programming) holding values that are an object (object-oriented programming).

Even if you wrote a set of values down on paper they might be an object. Say I record information about a person. They have a name, age, height, location, and so on. That set of information is an object of sorts.

So you have have some context to understand what someone means by object. Do they mean a set of related values, do they mean a formal construct in a language, is it a row in a table, is it some other meaning?",1518299047.0

The_Wisest_of_Fools,"JSON means JavaScript Object Notation. The reason JSON objects look a lot like dictionaries is because in JavaScript before ES6, Objects were basically just dictionaries. You can see some examples of older JS syntax here:

https://gist.github.com/remarkablemark/fa62af0a2c57f5ef54226cae2258b38d

In Swift however, all objects are not dictionaries. They are their own thing. People are going to tell you that Dictionaries are objects, and they are sort of right, but that only applies to the Swift type `Dictionary` which is a class that contains a [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) along with a bunch of methods to interact with it.

Kevo_CS,"I'm still getting started with swift, but from what I understand a Dictionary is Swift's implementation of a hashtable data structure. Meaning a Swift Dictionary is a struct or a class to encapsulate all that data and useful functions, otherwise known as an object. That being said, going past swift a dictionary is simply a data structure. Usually you'll find that you're using a standard library implementation of that data structure though. This is the case in Swift, and in following OOD principles it was deisgned as an object.",1518342260.0
lanzaio,"Learn some C if you want to get an intuitive understanding of the basics. C is incredibly transparent in how it works and what it's doing. Swift's worst feature, in my opinion, is just how horrifically opaque everything about the language is. 

An object is just a set of values in a processes memory. i.e. if we have

    struct Person {
        let name: String
        let age: Int
    }

Then an instance of a `Person` will be 16 consecutive bytes in memory. The first 8 pointing to the `name` `String` and the last 8 holding the actual value for `age`. 

A `Dictionary` is a `struct` where it's memory contains the elements of the dictionary and a bunch of utility functionality to properly handle this data. I'm too lazy to type it all out, but a quick ""how to write a dictionary in swift"" google search should find an explanation.  ",1518299002.0

In your service class you would setup the connection and monitor for web socket data, deserialize into objects and then push these objects as events into its Observables. In your views/view controllers you would then subscribe to the Observables exposed by your service and display the events/data as they come down the wire. Now up until there you pretty much have the same functionality as delegation or pub sub (Notification Center) but with Rx you get all kinds of neat features on top of this like throttling/debouncing events, replaying events, batching, combining events, etc and that is really nice.

* Specifications are for the weak and timid!
* This machine is GAGH! I need an iMac Pro with 18 processors if I am to do battle with this code!
* You cannot really appreciate Dilbert unless you've read it in the original Klingon.
* Indentation?! - I will show you how to indent when I indent your skull!
* What is this talk of 'review'? Klingons do not make software 'releases'. Our software 'escapes' to the App Store, leaving a bloody trail of app review people in its wake.
* Klingon function calls do not have 'parameters' - they have 'arguments' -- and they ALWAYS WIN THEM.
* Debugging? Klingons do not debug. Our software does not coddle the weak. Bugs are good for building character in the user.
* I have challenged the entire Swift Core team to a Bat-Leth contest on the holodeck. They will not concern us again.
* A TRUE Klingon Warrior does not comment his code!
* You have challenged the honor of my family by giving me a 1 star review. Prepare to die!
* You question the worthiness of my code? I should kill you where you stand!
* Our users will know fear and cower before our software! Ship it! Ship it and let them flee like the dogs they are!
* Our competitors are without honor!
* Interface Builder? That is for children. A Klingon Warrior uses only bitcode, keyed in on the front panel switches in raw binary.
* Klingon programs don't do accountancy. For that, you need a Ferengi.
* Klingon apps do not support ""multi-threading"". When a Klingon program wants to run, it challenges the main queue in hand-to-hand combat and owns the machine.

- You have section titles ""a"" through ""d"".
- When you have `hasD` false the only change is that ""d"" should be """"
- When you have `hasB` false and `hasD` false then ""b"" should be ""c"".

Here's the code:

     enum SectionTitle: String {
      case a, b, c, d

      func translate(hasB: Bool = false, hasD: Bool = false) -> SectionTitle? {
        if !hasD { return self == .d ? nil : self}
        if !hasB { return self == .b ? .c : self }
        return self
      }
    }

You can use it like:

    SectionTitle.a.translate()?.rawValue ?? """" // ""a""
    SectionTitle.d.translate()?.rawValue ?? """" // """"
    SectionTitle.b.translate(hasD: true)?.rawValue ?? """" // ""c""
    SectionTitle.d.translate(hasD: true)?.rawValue ?? """" // ""d""


Also, if you need the functionality of translating section numbers to titles you can include this in your `enum`:

      static let order: [SectionTitle] = [.a, .b, .c, .d]

      static func position(_ position: Int) -> SectionTitle? {
        guard position < order.count else { return nil }
        return order[position]

    SectionTitle.position(5) // nil

KarlJay001,"Most call it ""full stack"" so a ""standard"" iOS dev is expected to write an app that runs on the device and does things.

Some go past that and made a custom backend server to serve their own app.  This would be ""full stack"".

IMO, over the years, the jobs are asking for more and more, but the needs for all apps are not the same.  If you apply for a job doing a news feed reader or word games, you might not ever have a need to build a backend.

If you're trying to break into the market, having more skills is a plus, but being too thin isn't.  I've been doing this for years and was surprised at some of the things Git and Xcode can do when I took an advanced tutorial.

Being able to *also* write basic APIs yourself and help debug part of the backend is an *amazing* simplification though.

,"I’m sure the compiler can make some optimizations if it knows the scope where a member will be read/written is limited to a single type (or worse, but still good, a single file). It can prove many more assertions about the lifetime of the variable in question, and can even be sure that it will never be used in some instances. For instance if you create an object and never call a method relying on its private instance member `x` before the object is deallocated, then the compiler may be able to avoid even initializing `x` when it creates the object. This is especially important when dealing with multiple modules, as once the compiler compiles a module, it cannot go back and reoptimize it without access to the source code. ",1517963160.0

1 - Open the storyboard file with the TableViewController
2 - Select the TableViewController in the [Document Outline (that thing on the left that shows all the views)](http://static.iphonelife.com/sites/iphonelife.com/files/resize/u31369/Fig12DocumentOutline_0-500x336.jpg)
3 - Go to the [Connections Inspector](http://rshankar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/201407221059.jpg) and check if there are any references you don't realize. More specifically, if there is a connection to a MealTableViewCell somewhere in your TableViewController.


This may have happened because you connected the TableViewCell to your code (Dragged from storyboard to code while holding ctrl) and then erased the variable from the code without disconnecting the storyboard cell.

This is a no-no in Xcode because then you still have the dangling connection in the storyboard. You must hover over whatever connection you still have in the storyboard and press on ""x"" to disconnect.

triscal1990,"Seems like mainly a clickbait article.

mugunth_kumar,"Don't focus on learning a language. Focus on learn the platform instead. Just like how knowing Java doesn't automatically make you know Android developer, just knowing Swift won't help you with Cocoa Touch. Cocoa Touch is a beast (at least compared to Swift). Language nuances can be picked up and you can get used to in about a week where as learning and getting a deep understanding of the platform (Cocoa Touch) is a life-long thing.

Having said that, I would recommend learning Cocoa Touch using plain simple Swift (Plain simple Swift is swift without the functional aspects like filter/map/reduce (aka higher order functions), protocols, generics and the like). These advanced Swift concepts can be overwhelming, even more so than Objective-C's infamous square bracket syntax. 

*Write* some Objective-C, but don't focus on being able to write. As u/UIvapor points out, you should know to ""read"" Objective-C and the only way to get that skill is to write some. You will need to read a lot of Objective-C to learn Cocoa-Touch

Move up learn some Swifty stuff like Optionals, Enums and Collections (Note: You have collections provided by Cocoa Touch (NSArray, NSDictionary) and Swift has collections baked into the language. It's important to know the difference between them)

Then learn some advanced Swift stuff like Initializers, Protocols, Generics, higher order functions. Only now, you will be able to appreciate why Swift is better than Objective-C.

On the other hand if you want to represent local state transitions were you compose differents transformations on your state successively without really having to read it, then returning a new value makes more sense. For example as the accumulator of a call to `reduce` on array

When a computed property is get only, you may omit the get:

If your return value is a copy of another array, you can use `Sequence.map(_:)` like so:

    var orderedCompetitionArray: [Competition] {
        var arr = validSeasonsForCompetition.map { $0.key }
        arr.sort { $0.id < $1.id }
        return arr
    }

Finally, you may omit the assignments entirely and inline the whole thing:

    var orderedCompetitions: [Competition] {
        return validSeasons

silver_belt,"Forewarning, Objective-C developer here.

It sounds like a good use case for [NSNotificationCenter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotificationcenter).  If your AppDelegate is currently responsible for downloading and populating the array, you would have the AppDelegate post a notification once the array is ready.  Both of your view controllers would have already registered for that notification, and both will thus be notified immediately when AppDelegate posts it.

An alternative method would be to centralise your data operations to a new class.  Have the AppDelegate own an instance if you need, or make it a singleton if you don't see a case for creating multiple instances of this particular object.  Both of your view controllers would register as observers of the object, and conform to the protocol.  Then you can define a discrete protocol for notifying other objects of your data operations, and allow objects to register as observers.  

For example, imagine an AppData class. It provides an `-addObserver:` method, and will notify its observers of refreshed data via a protocol-defined `-appData:didRefreshData:` method.  If an error occurs, you could issue an `-appData:didFailWithError:` message.  This decouples AppDelegate from having to request *and* own the data *and* issue notifications for it, since that's not really its role.

That's two ways to solve the issue, one short-term and one long-term.",1517777470.0

This usually means a value is nil when it was force unwrapped with `!` (If you use `!` you have to be sure it cannot be `nil`). In your case this means either `inputTextView` is not connected in your Storyboard or Xib, because when unwrapping `inputTextView` it was `nil`.",1517603151.0

moyerr,"...? The variable must be assigned in the do, but it doesn’t have to be declared there.  ",1517544671.0
gonesolarizeddark,"You are right about the do block but lets break down the error first.

The error may sound funny at first but if we pick it apart piece-by-piece it should start to make sense. Public is a special access level and it doesn't necessarily mean that it makes the variable's value available to other files in the way you think it would.

The next part of the error has to do with scope. The do block is creating its own [scope](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Properties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH14-ID263) called a local scope. So any variables created within its curly braces are specific to just that. If you try to access them above or below the do block the complier will complain because the variable was created just inside those curlies. That is what the second part of the error about non-local scope means.

Assuming token is a String you could do something like this

    var token: String? = nil
    
    do {
      // parse JSON
      token = postData.token
    } catch {
      // handle error
    } 

    print(token)

The key is the variable is create outside and above the do block first with some initial value which in this case is just nil. Then you can use it below the do block to print it when the JSON work is done.

I should mention that now that the token variable has some value in it that doesn't mean its going to be seen by other files. You still probably don't want to use the public keyword here.

Usually when working with JSON you're telling the function that called the initial parsing to also provide a callback for when the JSON fetching and parsing is done. Thats a pretty common way to pass some asynchronous values around. From there you can use dependency injection or even singletons if that is suitable in this case to continue passing that value around.",1517544895.0

Do you have any serious experience with programming? If you can already develop in one language then learning another is fairly easy. However, it takes people much more than 6 months of study to become a serious developer. I certainly wouldn't hire someone who has that little experience. I'd spend too much time training them on the job.

If you're determined to do this without a formal degree I'd get involved with an open-source project. Start out with documentation and testing, move into fixing minor bugs, and then work on some features. Learn the language as you go, build up a resume of work on the project. After a year or so you might have enough experience to think of trying for serious jobs. Even better might be to move on to developing your own apps, although that market is pretty constrained right now.

jasamer,"> hashable is a way to make sure that you aren't referencing the same object when comparing by pulling the hashvalue

Two different objects (i.e. objects that are not equal) can have the same hash value, even though its unlikely. Basically, when two objects have different hashes, they are definitely not equal, but if they do have the same hash, they might still be not equal.

As /u/thecatbird says, a hash is needed to use some data structures/algorithms; for example in hash tables which are used in dictionaries and for sets.",1517303810.0
masklinn,"> Is that correct? If not please explain, also how does one use the Hashable in a real world situtation

Hash maps and hash sets (Dictionary and Set in Swift parlance). These provide average O(1) insertion, deletion and lookup.

The primary alternative is to use balanced-tree-based maps and sets but they provide average O(log n), require that the items be Comparable and have more pointer-chasing and data locality issues. Tree-based maps & sets have the advantage of being ordered & more suited for immutable data structures, but if these are not concerns (which is generally the case for imperative languages like Swift) hash-based collections tend to be more suitable.

Incidentally, hash array mapped tries provide an excellent alternative for immutability requirements, but also require hashable items.",1517314075.0

SteveB13,"I'm speculating slightly here, but it could be to do with the amount of memory required to store an instance of an object.

Adding functions and computed variables (which are basically just functions without arguments) don't require any additional memory to store an object. Adding a new stored variable requires additional memory to be allocated to store that object.

It would make sense that this would be an issue if a class / struct was declared in a module, and then extended outside of that module to add an additional variable. I guess the module would need to be recompiled to be aware of the user's extension, which would break encapsulation and really defeat the whole purpose of a module. If it were pre-compiled this wouldn't even be an option.

In my head it seems that it could be theoretically possible to extend a type to add additional stored properties in the same module that it is defined. The compiler should theoretically have enough information there to put all of the pieces together. Someone who knows a little more might be able to provide some more insight.",1517229871.0

Possible and better approaches are:

- In a higher layer and on a successful completion of the network action that contains a non error result, send a message to an object that knows what the frontmost UI viewController is and have it issue an update request to the VC.
- Detach the UI completely from the network result and in the UI viewController observe the data that the VC cares about.  Update the UI on a change in that data from the VC.",1517161454.0
MeatRockStardust,"You'll want to use a closure on the ``.withParsing`` method, and call that closure when the data task is complete

    func withParsing (request: URLRequest, complete:@escaping (_ seshID:String)->Void) {
      // guards ....
      let seshID = parse(json:data)
      complete(seshID)
    }

You should also call ``complete`` with an empty string or passing a ``Result`` class to handle when there is an error.

Then when you call the method:

    UdacityNetworkRequests.DataTask().withParsing(request: request) { seshID in
      if !seshID.isEmpty {
        appDelegate.sessionID = seshID

        }
      } else {
        // Present error to user so they no something went wrong
      }
    }

By calling you ``performSegue`` in the ``DispatchQueue.main.async`` block, it will update the UI on the main thread and avoid any freezing up.

The key is the ``complete`` block that gets called once the network call has finished.  Your ``.withParsing`` method is returning nil because it returns before the network call has finished.  Calling the ``complete`` block lets your code in the view controller know you have the ``seshID`` and it's time to perform the segue.

When the user starts the app check the stored variable and compare the date to the current one.

fluchtpunkt,"As a beginner you should not concentrate on tutorials about individual techniques. You should find a structured series that walks you through the whole process of creating an app from start to finish. I would recommend Apple's ""Intro to App Development with Swift"" (shorter) or ""App Development with Swift"" (goes into more detail), which are available for free on the iBook Store. Both are targeted at Swift-beginners, so you could skip the Intro when you want to use the second one. 

----

The next stuff only applies once you've finished such a series and know the principles of building an app. 

I believe there's no need to go through all iOS frameworks and UIKit views and follow tutorials about each and every one of them. There's nothing wrong with playing around though, so won't let that stop you from exploring topics you find interesting.  

I'm someone who once suffered from tutorial addiction. I read book after book and implemented tutorial after tutorial. After each book and tutorial I got better at following drag&drop instructions, copy&pasting code, pressing compile and moving projects to the trash.   
Your tutorial playlist with multiple scrollView tutorials sounds like you're on your way to tutorial addiction. At one point you have to stop reading, watching and playing. You will just learn a lot more when you work on a real project. Once you went through one tutorial you probably won't lean that much new stuff if you follow 10 others on a similar topic. 

That feeling that you don't know anything won't go away after the 10th tutorial either. Don't be ashamed to look things up, we all do it. Don't try to memorize the complete method names and parameters either. That's what the IDE is for.     
I've been doing iOS development for almost a decade, and outside of the things I use daily, I would have to look up quite a lot. I couldn't use things like SceneKit, SpriteKit or HealthKit at all without looking at the QuickStart guides Apple often publishes. But that doesn't make me a bad developer. I know I can learn these things when I need them. Right now for me it's enough to know that SceneKit exists and that it's a 3D rendering engine. When I need a 3D rendering engine I will learn SceneKit. 

That's why I would recommend to think about a project that you will ultimately publish to the App Store. Not a toy project to test scrollViews, a real app that people want to use. The most important things you will learn happen between the ""the bug doesn't matter, I'm just playing around"" phase and ""I don't have to be ashamed to let others use it"" phase. That's where you will learn about all the little details and caveats. That's when you start to think about how you can make it easier for your users. Following some scrollView tutorial that contains a lot of `// we skip error handling for brevity` comments won't teach you these skills. 

So how to find an app to build because there are apps for everything already? Don't think about that. Look at one of your hobbies or your interests with the view of someone who wants to publish an app. Do you enjoy riding your bike? Build an app that tracks your trips. Do you read paper magazines? Build an app where you can store ""bookmarks"" for interesting articles so you can find them later. Do you enjoy baking? Build an app that allows you to convert an existing recipe to a list of ingredients you need for a specific baking tray size. Do you like drinking beer? Build a beer tracker that logs each beer and calculates how much money you spend on beer per year. 

Ideally the app is something you yourself would use regularly. But it doesn't matter what it is, if you are interested in a certain technology like SceneKit for example try to think of something where you could use that technology. It also doesn't matter how useful it actually is, who cares how many people will actually download it. Obviously it should be an app that you can finish in a reasonable timeframe. So even if you enjoy office work you should not try to build a feature-comparable version of Apple's Numbers. 

Since you are no longer in tutorial land where you are told how to arrange views, you have to make a plan. So don't start coding yet, take a note book and scribble down what problem the app solves, what it should do, how it behaves and last but not least how it should be structured and how it should look. A few points and some rough sketches are enough. Revisit these notes regularly to change or amend them while developing the app. 

Then start building the app. Look up techniques when you need them, use tutorials if you want. Over the next weeks or months turn your project into an app that you could publish to the App Store. 


I am aware that you will not actually publish the app. You will discard the project eventually because you found something more interesting to work on. But don't start with the mindset that this is a worthless toy project that will be moved to the trash eventually. 

For what it's worth, I published my first project, a small single use tool for professionals in a niche sector. Every month for the last 7 or so years it has earned me between 50 and 100 bucks with ads and an in-app-purchase to remove ads. It's a very small project, an experienced developer would probably need 2-3 days to copy it verbatim. When I started there were like 2 dozen apps that did the same. I tried them all because I needed such an app for my hobby, but they were all cumbersome to use. So I created my own version with a slightly different concept. Didn't take long and people realized that my app is easier to use. Felt good when I received my first email from someone who told me that the app is really good and exactly what he needs. 

Thing is, I could have done all of that months earlier if I wouldn't have wasted my time with the 10th tutorial/article about something that I didn't use in that app.

----

TL;DR: 

1. Close Youtube.
2. Get Apple's ""App Development with Swift"" in the iBook store. 
3. Follow all 900 pages of it. 
4. Figure out what kind of app you want to publish to the App Store. 
5. Make a plan what your app needs, how it should behave and how it should look like so users want to use it
6. Implement this app. Learn things when you need them.
7. Publish your app.

eugeniu,"If you are completely new to coding in general, it might be a good idea to step away from learning app development and focus on learning programming fundamentals first, like variables, types, conditionals, control flow, and loops. Then more complex topics like functions, closures, structs, classes, objects, and the MVC design pattern. Once you've got the basics of that down, you can start learning how to make some iOS apps, and start learning more advanced Swift features like closures, enums, value/reference semantics, protocols, and generics.

If you already know some other programming language like Javascript, it's possible to learn Swift and iOS app development at the same time. But for people learning Swift as their first programming language, it's not very possible to also learn iOS app development at the same time in my opinion. You could follow tutorials that show you step-by-step how to build an app, but you won't have the foundational knowledge to understand what you're doing, so you won't learn a whole lot.

fubarx,"You've already subclassed UIButton which itself derives from UIView. So MyButton is a UIButton which is also a UIView. MyButton can reference its own view through self.view. Unless your button contains another button the IB reference to 'view' is unnecessary. 

Also if you really mean to have a button inside another one you might want to call the internal one something other than 'view' (like 'insideButton') so it doesn't collide with an existing property name.

Finally, you usually don't need to subclass a standard control unless you want to override some of its behavior (like add custom drawing or touch behavior) and reuse it in a number of places.",1516731161.0
fubarx,"The problem is the code you're using is designed for 'container' views. Meaning it's derived from a UIView and also contains other subviews. Since you're directly subclassing UIButton then MyButton itself is a view.

So to solve the 'no view' error when referencing self.view all you have to do is reference 'self'  i.e. instead of self.view.frame you would reference self.frame in a subclass method.

But that will cause you a different problem in the loadViewFromNib assignment. Since MyButton is a view, the line:

view = loadViewFromNib() as! UIButton!

would have to become

self = loadViewFromNib() as! UIButton!

But self is immutable so you can't assign another view to it. But you can set the bounds properly and addSubview the returned view to self. A simpler solution may be to wrap a UIButton inside a UIView, depending on what you're trying to do.",1516744540.0

inscrutablemike,"Welcome to the world of event-driven programs!

The alert doesn't appear when you call present(...) because all UI actions are actually *requests* for some thing to be done in the next cycle of the run loop. The run loop is, at the highest level, an infinite loop that reads inputs from the environment (touches, mouse clicks, network events, timers you configured, and anything else that might happen ""outside"" the program) and figures out what to do about them.

So, when you call present(..) on the Alert, the UIKit framework gets the request to show an alert sent to it. That request won't do anything until the current iteration of the loop ends and the run loop can read that request, figure out what it is, and send it to the UI system to be handled.

That's why the next line gets empty values from the alert. It's using a thing that hasn't even been shown to the user yet.

The next step is to move the code that makes use of the values to the {(action) in ... } section. But then.. how do you return them from the function? You don't. Because that function no longer is running, and the thing that calls the closure is something from the system that won't understand those return values. You'll have to write *another* func that takes those values as arguments and call *that* inside the closure instead of returning the values from it.

This is probably the most difficult idea to get your head around, but once you do a lot of the design of UIKit and its patterns make a lot more sense. ",1516569995.0

    func editTransaction(dateString: String, alertTitle: String, actionTitle: String, placeholderText: String, placeholderAmount: String, callback: @escaping (_ date: String, _ tag: String, _ amount: String)->()) {
        
        var dateTextField = UITextField()
        var tagTextField = UITextField()

        let action = UIAlertAction(title: actionTitle, style: .default) {(action) in
            
            callback(dateTextField.text!, tagTextField.text!, amountTextField.text!)
            
        }
        alert.addTextField {(alertTextField) in
            alertTextField.placeholder = dateString
            dateTextField = alertTextField
        }
        alert.addTextField {(alertTextField) in
            alertTextField.placeholder = placeholderText
            tagTextField = alertTextField

* Drop some comments in the code here and there to describe what your functions do and why. Just a sentence or two. It helps readers with context on the purpose of the function so we can review it a little better. I guess this would apply to all other languages too.

* Be consistent in MovieSections.swift where you are overriding functions from collectionView and put the 'override' keyword in all functions explicitly being overridden.

* You have a couple places where you're repeating yourself, like the spot where you're doing a cell.moviesCollectionView.reloadData() in both cases of an if/else. Just do it once after the block.

It also gives you a type safe and extremely concise anchor/equation style syntax which can create multiple related constraints readably in one line. The two styles can be mixed seamlessly(each is best at what the other is poor at) and have made autolayout a joy to use. I find them to be extremely readable because they eliminate so much of the boilerplate that obscures what you're actually trying to do. It also automatically does the right thing for translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints and isActive.   That said, I'll still use stack views occasionally(with some convenience methods to cut boilerplate) mostly for their ability to show/hide views on the fly without having to re-constrain them.

For example Regyn's example in mortar is:

    myView.m_centerX |=| view             //unspecified RHS anchor inferred to match LHS(centerX)
    m_visibleRegion ||^^ containerView    //in the operator || means with default padding and ^^ is vertical layout inside LHS. m_visibleRegion is the area inside top/bottom layout anchors

Speaking from my experience with merge conflicts related to storyboards in the past, they're backed by an xml file which isn't quite pretty enough to be human readable and not worth modifying in a text editor because of the great likelihood or corruption. I believe the xml itself is generated by the IDE, Xcode. Of course, this xml file contains references to UIKit objects and layout/dimensions which the compiler can interpret at build-time. 

As an example, a layout constraint would look like the following in the file: 

     <constraints>  

     <constraint firstAttribute=""height"" constant=""400"" id=""VT3-nW-96Q"">  

     <variation key=""heightClass=regular-widthClass=regular"" constant=""600""/>

        func greeting(for name: String) -> String { return ""\(greetingPrefix) \(name)"" }

Now, `ABC.greeting` is of type `(ABC) -> (String) -> String`. You can now pass any instance of `ABC` in to the closure to get a closure that takes a `String` and returns a `String`.
Or if you already have an instance of `ABC`, you can take the `greeting` func as a closure of type `(String) -> String`.

    let a = ABC(greetingPrefix: ""Hi"")
    let closure: (String) -> String = a.greeting

fliesandspiders,"I agree with you in terms of designing your model objects with non-optional properties, but you shouldn't just ""give up and crash"" from an invalid response.

If the invalid object is an item in an array, just skip it and throw an assertion failure in development, otherwise show some kind of error message to the user.

To implement that in a model, I normally use an optional initializer, like `init?(json: [String: Any]) { }` with a bunch of guards to make sure all required properties exist and are valid, and return nil if anything fails.

Then you can be defensive yet also have a nice design for your model object.

As an example with an array of posts:

    let posts = postsJSON.flatMap {
        guard let post = Post(json: $0) else {
            assertionFailure(""Failed to create post from JSON: \($0)"")
            return nil
        }
        return post
    }

Similarly for a single User object, do something like:

    guard let user = User(json: responseJSON) else {
        // do something to notify user of an error
        return
    }

I think this approach gets you away from the idea that an ""invalid response from server"" is an ""undefined state"".

You can then check for this error and fail gracefully, letting the user know what went wrong UI-side.

You need a layer that turns untrusted data into trusted data. It separates the data you get from he network from the rest of your app logic. That lets you use non-optionals in most of your code. Non-optional means you can trust that the value is there. Crashing in that part only happens if there’s a bug in your app logic or data sanitization, which is an appropriate reason to crash.

wavy_lines,"> Give up and crash?

Why the hell would you do that?

> in order to use Swift the way it was full heartedly meant to be used

Are you saying Swift is meant to write crappy apps that crash all the time?

You have it backwards. You are favoring ""ease of writing code"" over ""quality of product"".

I know this is how we approach our small fun side projects, but this is not how you build products that you distribute to people.

> Don't we want to define variables as non-optionals if in fact they should always be non-optionals in order for our app to 100% properly function? If not, then we are losing one of Swift's most powerful concepts and features and have no reason to use Swift over any other language. 

This is again backwards. The ""optionals"" thing exist precisely to handle situations where you are not sure whether the data is really there or not. When you are loading data from the network, _you are not sure if the data is there at all_. 

> Shouldn't the server have the responsibility of validating values before it sends it back in a JSON response?

Yes it should, but that doesn't mean you get to write crappy code because you hope the server has the good code.

ok, here's one thing to consider:

Instead of ""give up and crash"", how about ""show an error message to the user""?

If your application cannot function without proper data from the server, it should tell the user there was some error in communicating with the server; instead of just crashing.

If the application can still provide something useful to the user even in the absence of the data from the server, then it should do so instead of giving up.

Note:

I'm not saying you should make all fields optional. I'm saying you should not crash if you get bad input from your server. Instead, you should handle the error gracefully and proceed if you can.

For example, if you have a search page that returns results, and the results from the server are not formatted in a way that you expect, you can tell the user something to the extent of ""server error when searching"". No reason to crash.",1516099458.0

Deciding to embrace a functional reactive framework can bring a lot of advantages to the table, not using delegates is just a side effect. 

If the only benefit you are going to see from using RxSwift is to get rid of delegates, you are adding quite a big dependency to your project (not to mention making the learning curve for new developers who are going to work on it steeper), and adding a complete set of arguably complex paradigms to replace a fairly simple design pattern (i.e. delegates).

That being said, if you are interested in learning functional reactive programming, by all mean give it a go; but the video you mentioned along with all the available info on the topic should make it quite obvious that it brings a ton of advantages other than just an alternative to delegates.

Remember that you do have to think about memory management when it comes to delegates (retain cycles!) but if you feel like RxSwift's disposable pattern is a step back, I suggest you have a look at Matt Gallagher's `CwlSignal` library [1]. It offers most of the same operators as RxSwift, but doesn't have the disposable pattern for managing memory

They could then implement Interactable, Destructible, Controllable, Drinkable, Explodable, InventoryRepresentible, etc. You could then define a common thingy like PlayerItem in terms of composing different protocols: maybe a PlayerItem would implement InventoryRepresentible and Collectible (which would implement Controllable). 

Once you’ve got that sorted out, implementing JSON-based “persistence” would be trivial — make each concrete entity, like the PlayerItem from above, conform to Codable.

twostraws,"I've written some shocking code in my time, although perhaps not quite as bad as the example you give. In one case I ended up with one epic `UIView` subclass that had more tentacles than a sushi bar, and it's the kind of thing you'd say once a month ""this really should be ten different classes,"" then sigh and move on.

It's a bit of a long tangent, but: no one likes writing bad code, and I think in some ways iOS/macOS/watchOS/tvOS apps are particularly prone to it for a few reasons:

1. Every year, Apple announces thousands of new APIs. iOS 11 was particularly big, but no year is small. If you don't support features like `SFSafariViewController` (from iOS 9), the `UserNotifications` framework (from iOS 10), and drag and drop (from iOS 11), users complain either by email or on the App Store.
2. Every year, Apple deprecates hundreds of old APIs. You can still rely on them to a point, but you'll get warnings in your code. (""So what? It's only a warning."" Warning *matter*: they are code smells being reported back to you in a clear, concise way, and if you clutter your warnings then it's likely you'll miss something important.)
3. Every year, Apple drops a major new Swift version. Every six months, Apple drops a minor new Swift version. These things not only break code, but they also require you to rethink and refactor your own code if you want to take advantage of them – taking advantage of `Codable`, for example, has been a huge job for projects like Vapor and Kitura, and even adopting something simple like multi-line strings takes time.
4. Every year Apple drops new form factors and hardware profiles on us. 2017 gave us iPhone X, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and Apple TV 4K, 2016 gave us the Touch Bar and 9.7-inch iPad Pro, 2015 gave us 4th-gen Apple TV and Apple Watch, 2014 gave us iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, etc. (""Just use Auto Layout!"" Yes, because that's all it takes. [*Narrator: ""Before they had one problem; now they have two problems and an unsatisfied constraint.""*])

Those are four big things, but none of them have much to do with your business. In your business you have two priorities:

1. Fix existing bugs. That JIRA dashboard you have on a wall-mounted 55-inch TV? Yeah, you should probably have bought a bigger TV.
2. Add new features to generate revenue, either by increasing average revenue per user or by attracting new users.

There's also a third unwritten priority: trying to convince your boss to let you refactor some code you know sucks. ""Listen, the end result will look exactly like what we have right now, and it will generate no extra revenue, but the code will be a lot better"" – unless your board is technically switched on that's a hard argument to win.

So you're in a constant state of flux. Every year you know you're going to need to set time aside to watch a big stack of WWDC videos and figure out how it impacts your products. You'll also then need to fix any deprecations, upgrade your Swift code, add some more devices to your test sheet, then make sure you haven't introduced new bugs along the way – and that's before you do any work of your own.

It's easy to join a company and say ""what the hell? I would never have let this happen,"" but the truth is that when you've gone through a dozen ""this is a really big client and they need this feature""-s and a dozen ""our Korean users are hitting a major problem with iOS 10.1.3.2.9 on iPad Mini 9 when used in airplanes please fix it immediately""-s, you shouldn't feel so bad about your code.",1515668497.0

Then you should remove them from the repo:

find . -name .DS_Store | xargs git rm --cached

This will remove them from git but leave them on your local disk. Then make a commit.

From this point on they should be ignored and git won't add them as you add new folders & files and make new commits.

I would also move each delegate protocol into its own file, so they are easy to locate. (i.e. I know I'm looking for a WeatherDataDelegate, but where is it?)

I typically call my delegate methods on the main queue to avoid my controller being responsible for that. Certainly this is not a universal rule, but if you can make the case for it, I think it makes for slimmer controllers.

Lastly, it's not a great idea to embed your apiKey in an open source project like this. Chances are near 100% someone will search for this and find your key, which opens up their API to abuse.  An approach I really like is using Cocoapods-keys (but I wouldn't recommend this unless you're already using Cocoapods).  Another approach is to keep this file out of source control using the method above. The project won't compile for others that clone it, but with a note in the README it might not be a big deal.

- A would try to avoid using singleton classes (WeatherAPI) and use dependency injection instead. You haven’t done any unit test, but dependency injection will help you a lot writing unit tests.
- I think CoreLocation should be handled by a different class, and WeatherAPI just do the networking. Try every class do just one thing.
- Maybe it is a matter of personal preference, but I think the WeatherAPI could receive a completion closure parameters instead of using a delegate. 
- Use guards to make code easier to read (for example in completion handler in session.dataTask you can use guard to check for a nil error instead of the if).
- Try to keep consistency with your code style, try to structure the code in the same way for every class (for example, private properties first, then public, then private methods, public methods, and so on. I would use extensions when possible to group functionality and implement protocols.

I hope this helps.",1515630946.0
Esteluk,"Some stuff I'd say in a code review, though I have a bad habit of dwelling too long on style comments that ultimately are a matter of taste (or at least, personal/business convention):

Your Constants are set up as global variables, but these tend to not be preferred in most iOS projects - it's usually better to make a `enum Constants { static let value = ""..."" }` class.

(Style) you don't need the auto-generated header on every class. All those wasted bytes! Most don't need the Foundation import either.

You've got a file name `Enums.swift`. Why not just keep a separate file for each enum? Makes it easier to find.

Your `SpecficError` (typo) enum extends String. Why not extend the `Error` type instead? Then your error delegate can pass back `SpecificError` cases that would in themselves be errors.

Looking at your protocols, they're missing a quality of good Swift where the functions [read like prose](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide#prose) - when you call `weatherDataDelegate.setWeatherData(weatherData: weatherData)` that doesn't feel very... elegant?  `func set(weatherData: WeatherData)` or in extremis `func setWeatherData(_ weatherData: WeatherData)` might be better signatures.

Some of your structs in `WeatherData` could have better naming - it's nice to know at a glace what a `Main` type might be? `JSONData` sounds like it's just the Data object that you return from the `URLSession`.

If you write some custom decoders you can simplify the object structure a lot and remove some of the unnecessarily nested objects (the `Main` and `WeatherID` structs aren't really providing anything of value).

Like another comment said, singletons are almost always evil.

In the `WeatherAPI` it's common practice to separate delegate implementations like the `CLLocationManagerDelegate` methods into a separate extension in the same file. I agree with the other comment that it would be better to separate the `WeatherAPI` and Location services into two distinct classes. 

(Style) Swift prefers camelCase for property names, not the TitleCase you're using for `WeatherDataDelegate` and `ErrorDelegate`.

Why use `startUpdatingLocation` / `stopUpdatingLocation` and not just call `requestLocation()`?

Why are you using the a property named `weatherID` to refer to the name of a local `UIImage` file that you want to show? It's pretty confusing! It would be completely reasonable to change your `WeatherData` object to hold that `UIImage` object too. 

Heck, rather than have a `updateWeatherIcon()` method anywhere near the `WeatherAPI` class, why not make something similar as a computed property on your `WeatherData` struct? It would be pretty easy to change this so that your API directly decodes a single `WeatherData` struct that you can pass directly back to the delegate.

In the `HomeViewController` I'm not really sure what you accomplish by putting everything in a `DispatchQueue.main.async` block. Nothing inside any of them should require this? Unless I'm missing something dumb...

Most `IBOutlets` should be `private` usually. 

In your `changeCity(viewController: ` method I think it's probably better for the `ChangeCityViewController` to dismiss itself and only pass the city name back to the hosting view controller.

Lots of this is quite nit-picky! Which is good, because it means you're hammering the fundamentals well :D",1515799864.0

I can’t say if this really is the case, but I think you might be lacking knowledge in some fundamental iOS API’s. Once you read the docs, UICollectionView is fairly straightforward. 

1.	Stanford CS193P. Easily the best iOS course to date. Almost all skills transfer to Mac development as well — I was able to make a menu bar app that executes a bash script in about 1-2 hours. 
2.	Depends on the problem. If it’s a memory leak, I usually cry myself to sleep and wake up the next morning with a partial solution. Rinse and repeat until there are no more leaks. If it’s stuff like learning to interact with an API, which seems to be the case for you, I reduce the problem size. For instance, if I need to make a UITableView with a variable amount of sections which all have a variable amount of rows, I’ll start with a single section and single row, make it suit my needs, add more rows, add more sections. It’s all just a big game, and you can’t go fighting Bowser if you haven’t stomped a Goomba. 
3.	I look at the code I wrote 2..<6 months ago, cringe, and try to come up with an alternative design. Also there’s always at least three side projects going on at any one given time, all in different domains, so that’s fun. Regularly reading blogs, other people’s code, and random GitHub repos also seems to work quite well for me.

TheBartoge,"I’ll preface this by saying I’m not that experienced. I’ve had a few internships, and only recently graduated from college. I’ll actually be starting my first job in industry in a few weeks! However, I’ve found myself in a situation similar to yours as I also switched majors to computer science midway through my college career, so I hope these comments will be useful. To answer your questions...

1.	Some of the best resources I find are from Apple themselves. If you want to dig deeper into UIKit, their documentation is fairly expansive. If some code looks like gibberish to you, then go through that code line by line and figure out what is happening. Is there an object, or method you don’t recognize? Look it up and read about it. Apple provides many great keynotes where some cover topics broadly and others offer more of deep dive on a specific topic. If you are looking into learning more about Swift itself, I found [this keynote](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408) to be fascinating for example (note this one is a couple years old so the syntax is old but the concepts are still relevant). Many of the keynotes come with sample code that you can play around with and learn from as well and they offer a lot of guides as well.

2.	Regarding road blocks, I find that walking away from a problem for a couple hours to a day helps me come back to look at it with a fresh set of eyes. Note that this requires that you have a couple hours or a day to spend away from the problem, so if you need to plan your time accordingly so that you make sure you don’t end up stuck during crunch time when your deadline is the next day.

3.	One good practice I found is tinkering. If you’ve solved a problem, think if there is another way to do it. What are the advantages of your current solution compared to another one? Would your solution change if the problem was slightly modified? For example, lets say you created a program to maintain word counts of a text file. You’ve created a dictionary with unique words as the keys, and counts as the values. Are you done? Is a dictionary the best way to store the words? Are there any data structures built to handle words (perhaps a trie)? Would your solution change if you wanted to count plurals with their single counterparts (so boys and boy would contribute to the same count)? Really try to explore the problem space to see if there is anything else you can learn.

Hope that helps!",1515592156.0
dovemancare,I think the [top google result](http://mikebuss.com/2014/06/22/lazy-initialization-swift/) for lazy variables is a better explanation than what you could receive from a reddit comment,1515704337.0
dovemancare,"The most simple explanation I can give you for static vars is [Double.pi](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/double/1846975-pi).

Basically is a value that is constant across all the instances, and that you can query even without instantiating the class/struct it contains.

For example let's say we need to calculate the volume of a sphere based on it's radius. 

    let radius: Double = 18
    
    var volume: Double {
        return 4/3*Double.pi*pow(radius, 3)
    }

We don't need to instantiate a `Double` in order to get it's property `pi`, because it's a static (or type) property.",1515705072.0
theprangnetwork,"`get` and `set` are used when declaring protocols to specify mutability, and also when defining variables with custom getters and setters:
    
    protocol SomeProtocol {
        var someVariable: SomeType { get } //Means that someVariable only needs to be gettable to satisfy the requirements of SomeProtocol.
        var someOtherVariable: SomeType { get set } //Means that someOtherVariable must be gettable and settable to satisfy the requirements of SomeProtocol.
    }

The easiest way to satisfy a `{ get }` requirement is to use `let` and declare a variable as a constant. Otherwise, you can use a computed property (`area` in the example below):

    struct Quadrilateral {
        let width: Double
        let height: Double
        var area: Double {
            return width * height
        }
    }

Computed properties implicitly have a `get` specifier. For example, the `Quadrilateral` below is functionally identical to the `Quadrilateral` above:

    struct Quadrilateral {
        let width: Double
        let height: Double
        var area: Double {
            get {
                return width * height
            }
        }
    }

In the `Quadrilateral` examples above, you can't set `area` directly because it only has a `get` specifier. This makes it a *computed property*, meaning that its value is determined by the values of other variables in the `Quadrilateral` structure. To make a computed property settable, you must add a `set` specifier:

    struct Square {
        var sideLength: Double

        var area: Double {
            get {
                return pow(sideLength, 2) //sideLength squared
            } set {
                sideLength = sqrt(newValue) //newValue is the value that was just set
            }
        }
    }

Now you can manually get and set `area` in the `Square` structure. I'll let other people chime in to talk about `lazy` and `static`.",1515535548.0

So I can just `try someOptional.unwrap(or: SomeError.someCase)` when I need the optionals value.

I cases where I don't want a throwing function, I tend to use a guard let to unwrap all the optionals I need, making sure to not use multiple guard statements when I can also coalesce them into one.

In short functions that only have one optional to unwrap, `Optional.map` and `Optional.flatMap` can also be nice.

AlexanderMomchilov,"`Sequence` has two `max` functions (and similarly, two `min` and two `sort`/`sorted` functions).

The first, [`max()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence/1641492-max), exists on `Sequences` of `Comparable` elements (expressed as `extension Sequence where Element: Comparable`) . It determines the maximal element of the sequence using the `<` operator defined by the `Element` (which it requires in order to conform to `Comparable` and to be qualified to have this varient of `max()`.

It behaves much like `sequence.sorted().last`, but it's more efficient (time complexity of `O(seq.count)` rather than the `O(seq.count * log_2(seq.count)` of sorting), uses less memory, and is more concise. 

    let x = [""a"", ""yo"", ""xyz""]
    print(x.sorted().last) // => Optional(""yo"")
    print(x.max()) // => Optional(""yo"")

The second variant, [`max(by:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence/2906531-max) is the one in your question. It is available on all Sequences, not just those with `Comparable` elements. It lets you provide your own closure, which they call `areInIncreasingOrder`, which has type `(Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool`. It let's you specify, well... if two elements are in increasing order. In your example, `$0` and `$1` are in increasing order if `$0.count` is `<` than `$1.count`. This orders strings by their length, and takes the longest one.

If the code you provided used the first variant, `max`, then effectively `areInIncreasingOrder` is specified as the `<` on `String`, which would take the maximal element by lexicographical sorting (i.e. the one which would appear last in an English dictionary).

The second variant behaves much like `sorted(by: areInIncreasingOrder).last`, but with the same performance/clarity benefits mentioned earlier.

    let x = [""a"", ""yo"", ""xyz""]
    print(x.sorted{ $0.count < $1.count }.last) // => Optional(""xyz"")
    print(x.max{ $0.count < $1.count }) // => Optional(""xyz"")

P.S. `x.sorted{ $0.count < $1.count }` is just syntactic sugar for `x.sorted{ (a: String, b: String) -> Bool in return a.count <  b.count }`.  See [my related answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40390414/3141234) for a breakdown of Swift's closure-related syntactic sugar",1515434152.0

jhartl,"I can tell you about my experience:
I had zero programming experience. I had wanted to learn how to develop apps for a long time. I tried diving into Objective C, but would get so overwhelmed by the syntax that I gave up multiple times. With the release of Swift, I figured it was my chance to go for it. I read Apple's [Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID309) cover to cover and took extensive notes. I then started trying to build simple apps with some success. I quickly learned that I needed feedback about whether my code was ""right."" I enrolled in the Udacity beginning IOS development and raced through it (it's pretty fun, but it is expensive). I then did the IOS developer course and built my first store app as the final project ([EnBloc](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/enbloc/id1271878178?ls=1&mt=8)). I am now working on the app I have always wanted to build. I usually refer back to my Udacity notes or Stack Overflow when I get stuck.

I would say my total time was about a year to year and half from starting to learn, to getting through the courses to publishing the app. This is also while holding down a full-time career and raising a newborn. 

My advice would be to have a final goal in mind. My main motivation is the app I am building right now. It is something I really want to see exist and is something I would use. You will hit obstacles, but make sure you have something that motivates you, otherwise you will likely give up when it gets hard. 

Swift is a great language and programming is super addictive. Good luck.

_JKK_,"In my short experience, Swift is a beautiful language, and relatively simple to learn to use effectively (if not to the point of mastery). 

However, the difficulty of iOS development is the same as any other platform: it’s in the nuances of the platform, knowledge of APIs, and how to use the tool chain.

Pick PY, JS, Java, C, C++, Swift, whatever and spend some time to learn it.

imizaac,"First things first, you can get a used mac for $400 on eBay. I filter for an i7 and 8gb of ram, you can filter for more ram, or an ssd too and still get a cheap computer. I have found a 2011 series macbook pro, with 16gb of ram, an i7 processor, and a 256 gb ssd for 400. This is the only way I'd recommend getting a mac.

If you have reservations about that, you can make a hackintosh. It's much harder, but better performance/dollar. But trust me, you can find a good laptop on eBay. 

Html and css are essentially markup only. This is not the same as swift. In swift you'll have a huge amount of things that will be challenging to start on. For example. In js, python, ruby and many others the type system is hidden from you. In swift you must work with it. This makes it harder to learn and slows production, but fundamentally you need to be aware of types when you program and so it's going to be worth it.

I started learning swift march of last year. By June I was working on an app that revolved and optical character recognition (ocr). The challenges of this tech and the framework I used losing support prevented me from going to market, but I would have shipped in November. I worked roughly 5 hours a night learning and programming. 

I also learned python in a few days in the summer because of my background in swift. In the last month I've learned JavaScript and now I have a node server running and I'm working on a react website. All of these would have been harder to learn without my background in swift. 

Swift is a really good language to start with. I'm betting you're probably 6 months away from shipping an app. Which is a ways tbh.

adtrevor,"What’s great with Swift is that it has a soft learning curve : it’s designed following the principle of progressive disclosure meaning you typically don’t have to know about advanced concepts if you don’t have a specific need to use them for whatever project you are building. In other words, Swift can be learned by a 10 yo even tough it is also intended to be an industrial quality language you could use for advanced projects.

You indeed don’t need to buy a Mac to start learning about the language itself as the Swift tool chain is also available on Linux, also don’t forget about online Swift interpreters which can be pretty cool too if you just want to try the basics.

You’ll need a Mac to develop iOS apps using Xcode, as others have stated learning a programming language isn’t the only thing you need to build an app : you must also understand the frameworks, how the App Store works etc.. before publishing.

About the computer science part, Swift did made me discover some CS principles in a really cool way, I think probably faster than with more traditional courses would have, now that I am a CS student courses complement this (and of course also make me learn about whole new concepts).

fubarx,"What I like doing is to  break the networking into three parts with two of them as standalone. 

One deals with the low-level stuff, like URLsessions, progress, errors, etc. The second part deals with caching and translation of the data into values the app can use. For example if JSON comes back, parsing it into dictionaries or objects. 

Going the other way, this layer also has calls that eventually translate to REST calls, for example 'addUser' with a bunch of params gets converted into a dictionary which then calls the low-level networking for a POST to a given URL. 

Each of these components should be kept isolated from each other. This makes it so you can replace them with fake or 'mocked' versions that offer the same interface but can be used for quick development and testing. 

The last part is the main app. It calls the second tier ONLY. It doesn't know about the low-level networking at all. If you want to be real clean about it you can wrap both low-level components in a standalone wrapper and turn it all into a standalone framework. This way you can reuse all that stuff as an SDK in a separate app or use it in a testing target.

The trick is to break things into decoupled layers that interact with each other through APIs. That way you can change things as you develop without having to do a lot of search and replace all over the place if, say, a new field is added to the back-end.",1515174887.0

divinedominion,"As others pointed out, this is a **global variable**. It has _internal_ visibility and will be _lazily_ initialized (given that you provide an initial value, or change the type to `Any!` or `Any?`, which you have to, because the sample code won't compile like this).

Swift is interesting when it comes to ""root level""-code instructions. This term is about the code as _plain text_.  It denotes the stuff you write outside any curly braces. Stuff on this level can be type declarations in the _global namespace_, like your class `ExampleViewController` is, or typealiases, for example. It can also contain variable declarations in the global namespace, turning them into global variables. The interesting thing about this is the ability to just put stuff at the root level in any file and it becomes included in the global namespace, just like that. (Of course you can restrict availability of declarations to the file scope with `fileprivate`.) I think of this to be similar to `extension`s, only that you extend the global namespace implicitly instead of writing an explicit type extension.

Scattering globally available information all over the place will make finding stuff harder, though. Xcode's symbol navigator can help (⌘⇧O) to think in terms of symbols instead of files, but proper partitioning of declarations into their own files will be much more helpful. Because our brain clusters information, and having a properly named file helps to organize this info and navigate around. 

Part of your initial question was:

> is this variable created with every instance of ExampleViewController?

Create two types:

    class PersonClass { var name: String; var age: Int }
    struct PersonStruct { var name: String; var age: Int }

and a function

    func changePersons(struct: PersonStruct, class: PersonClass) {
        struct.name = ""Fred""
        struct.age = 44
        class.name = ""Fred""
        class.age = 44
    }

and call it

    var s = PersonStruct(name: ""John"", age: 20)
    var c = PersonClass(name: ""John"", age: 20)
    changePersons(struct: s, class: c)
    print(""struct:"",s)
    print(""class:"",c)

(side note, this won't actually work because Swift prevents you from modifying a struct argument to a function to prevent you from making this very mistake. But pretending it didn't...)

What you'll see is that struct version is still ""John"" and 20 and the class version is ""Fred"" and 44. 

A class is a reference type. That means when you pass it around you tell the target ""here, this object is at memory address 0xf1eacd. Do what you want with it."" And the recipient can modify the values at that address if it so wishes. Since both the source and the target were referring to memory address 0xf1eacd they both will experience whatever changes are made to the values at that address.

A struct is a value type. That means when you pass it around you tell the target ""here, this object had the values ""John"" and 20. Write those down on your own notepad and do whatever you want to it."" So the recipient can only change it's own version of this object. So when the target changes the value it's only changing the value on it's own personal notepad and doesn't touch the sources version. 

If you want to know what the point of a sturct/class is in the first place then that's relatively simple. 

Imagine you had the concept of a Person that you wanted to model. Prior to structs you'd have to write:

    let johnsName = ""John""
    let johnsAge = 20

and if you wanted to use those values in a function you'd have to write

    func printOutJohnsInfo(johnsName: String, johnsAge: Int) { print(johnsName, johnsAge) }

an obvious grouping would be to combine those into some sort of structure that the compiler will do this bookkeeping for you:

    struct Person {
        let name: String
        let age: Int
        func printInfo() { print(name, age)
    }
    let john = Person(name: ""John"", age: 20)
    print(john)

the compiler actually turns the struct version into the non-struct version later during the compilation process. This is all just window dressing to facilitate ease for the programmer.

For example, if you're writing a piece of bank software, you'll need access to your customers name and contact details in many places. Rather than shipping around separate strings and such (such as first and last names), you can just define a `Person` struct that encapsulates them all together, and you can just conveniently pass around `Customer` structs as a whole:

Structs are passed around the app as a pointer, so they are always by reference.  So when you pass a struct into a function, you can modify it in that function.  A class makes a copy so you then have two and any changes don't make it back to the other.

I'll let some others jump in for other differences.

Edit: Structs are by value and Classes are by pointer, but stucts are faster.",1515103385.0

The main reason for no major advancement most likely is the ever changing language. Swift is yet to have an [ABI stable](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ABIStabilityManifesto.md) standard library so it can be part of the OS and we don't have to package it with every single app like we do atm. There will also be no major code breaking migrations with new Swift versions, what very few production environment can afford generally. This is also a big no no for many to adopt Swift.

The ABI stability is promised in [Swift 5.0](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution), which will be available this year, so I'd say we'll see more advancement on other platforms and even more activity in the already vibrant Swift communities of the Apple ecosystem.",1515050110.0
H1Supreme,"Although, I don't use Swift on a daily basis, I do think it's a great language, and wish I had more incentive to start a project with it. I can't speak to the speed of it, but I do have an opinion on why it's not adopted outside of Apple targeted platforms.

My opinion is that only open sourcing the language, while keeping Core Graphics, Core Audio, and all the other useful libraries closed source was the reason it didn't catch any steam. I understand that there are open source alternatives, but that's not enough, obviously.

If Apple came out of the gate with open source versions of those libraries, I suspect there would have been a much larger response. It certainly would have taken some of the Electron / Reactive Native market share. Plus, the Xamarin / Cross Platform apps would have had a good competitor in Swift + Core libraries. 

It's great that use can use Swift for web projects, but honestly, who cares? There's entirely too much competition in that domain. And, if I have to re-invent the wheel for graphics and audio, I'll look elsewhere. Which, is really too bad, because I'd much rather write Swift than C++.",1515077658.0

It's weird to change unit tests where hard-coded sample dates were from January 2017 and notice just how much time this took. I think this is my indie app dev equivalent to a doctoral thesis, compared to the much simpler apps I wrote in the past.

The most challenging part is getting Markdown live syntax highlighting to work _properly_. Getting a sluggish highlighter up and running is simple, but high quality stuff? Phew! I settled for a self-made, 80% correct solution that I'm going to replace with the MultiMarkdown C library after release of the app. For now, dabbling with the C API only defers the release without much of a benefit.

All in all, the layered architecture approach still scales well. The core is very functional, in a ""functional programming"" sense (using a core model that does nothing except provide business rules, then there's the core state module which adapts ReSwift; both are well tested and are easy to extend). The application layer and its UI gives me most of the headaches -- for one, this is where the syntax highlighting happens, and also AppKit code in general gets convoluted easily. I don't like to change the views/view controller setup. It's too brittle for my taste. All the rest, from core to app layer service objects, is still fun to read and extend, which is a good sign.

Continuing to work on my first and only app, [LinguaBrowse](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/linguabrowse/id1281350165?mt=8): a free web browser for reading foreign-language websites on iPhone & iPad.

It allows you to immerse yourself in native texts in any of over 30 languages without having to constantly switch out to different apps for tools like dictionaries and alphabet charts; everything you need is inside, and accessible with a single tap.

## CORE FEATURES

* Tap-to-define: defines a word with a popup dictionary.

* Tap-to-speak: speaks the word aloud (via text-to-speech).

* Add phonetic transcriptions: add phonetic transcriptive text like pīnyīn (for Chinese), hiragana (for Japanese), or Roman characters for any other language (e.g. Russian, Greek, etc.)

* Universal: There's large support for different language pairs, so e.g. a Bulgarian person can learn Croatian using a Bulgarian<->Croatian bilingual dictionary.

## WHAT'S NEW

* Over the weekend, I'll be adding lemmatisation support for many languages, so that you can directly look up words that aren't already in their dictionary form (without relying on the system dictionaries supporting lemmatisation). I'd originally managed to fully support this for Japanese (by bundling a custom tokeniser), but this will add support for Korean (by hijacking my Japanese tokeniser) and also all the NSLinguisticTagger lemmatisers: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, and Russian!

* The lemmatisation feature allows users to break up any German compound word into its constituent parts before choosing which to look up in a dictionary.

If you want your `nOne` textfield to show an error message for if any of this fails (ie if you get nil) then you can use the nil coalescing operator, which is `??`. It is used just like this:

It pastes JSON as code or types depending on the source language of the current file. It currently supports Swift, C++, Obj-C++, and Java.

1. Does it even work for you?
2. Is it useful?
3. How is the quality of the generated Swift code? Specifically, when pasting as code, do you like the Codable implementations and convenience initializers?
3. How could I make it better?

Thanks!

One issue I noted regarding the parsing itself is when you have a unique key you need decoded, e.g.:

    ""unit1"": {
        ""key1"": ""value1""
    }

and you need to access ""unit1"", you need to handle it manually, especially if the key name can vary (as it was the case in one of my apps - the parser just used the value it received in JSON). In all honesty though, I don't see a way to handle it automatically off the top of my head.",1514968664.0

Secondly to go to the next question just increment the array index and place the new text into the required fields and reset the text entry field. You can have the user hit a button or extend your ViewController with UITextFieldDelegate and when editing ends for the textfield go to the next question. 

You can also for the answer text field give it a target when a special action on the text field is triggered
Ex: answerField.addTarget(...)

But if you're not building on top of Foundation/ObjC I don't see a compelling reason to go with Swift over other 'modern' languages such as D/Rust/Go/etc. Apple opened the door for Swift to get widely ported but never gave anybody a reason to do the work.

jdh30,"Once upon a time, I had a Mac. I hated it. Worst computer I ever owned. I gave it away for free to my brother-in-law who needed a computer. I used to have an iPhone too but I jacked that in because of Apple's metaprogramming T&C clause. Now I pay other people to deal with Macs for me when we absolutely must, e.g. one of my companys has an iOS app which is written in Xamarin. I'm never going back to Apple myself.

However, I am very interested in Swift. I think Swift occupies a very interesting spot in the language design space. I like OCaml and F# mainly thanks to algebraic datatypes, pattern matching, type inference and generics. Windows has .NET but Linux has precious little in comparison and desperately needs a modern language with a serious backer to create an ecosystem with decent libraries. I think Swift could be that.

Futhermore, I never heard of Apple's work on Linux a year ago. What I did hear is that Swift just reached a usable maturity on Linux including Raspberry Pi (which is my go-to Linux box these days) so I downloaded it and had a play. I even managed to [port a benchmark to Swift myself](https://flyingfrogblog.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/does-reference-counting-really-use-less_26.html) and, although the results weren't compelling, it was a good first stab and I definitely don't want to give up on it. Frankly, anything Go can do, Swift can do better (IMO).

My main reservation about Swift is that it leaks cycles. I'd have preferred either the language to impose a unidirectional heap so reference counting was accurate (like Erlang or Mathematica) or a tracing GC (like OCaml or .NET). This is a concern for back-end work because you're writing long-running daemons so memory leaks are a killer problem.

I suspect many other people are in the same boat so I certainly wouldn't write off Swift on Linux yet.

applishish,"I don't understand the purpose of this.

It's using JSON for test data, so it's literally only used when running automated tests, so there's no production benefit.  It claims to be ""type-safe"" but still has pieces like `""type"": ""answer""`, which means a typo can still trivially violate the invariant that posts can only be type ""answer"" or ""question"", which is the reason for using a Swift enum.

If you're defining the data model in Swift, and you need some sample data structures in Swift, why take a trip through JSON at all?  Just write the thing you want directly:

    struct PostTestCases {
        struct Valid {
            static let questionSample = Post.question(Question(postId: 119, title: ""How to write unit tests"", body: ""Please teach me!"", answerIds: [120, 121]))
        }
    }

It's shorter, faster, easier to read, and actually type-safe.

Or if you care about your mock test data existing in memory as a JSON string at some point, just paste the JSON (like in the first listing), because writing JSONValue-in-Swift doesn't look anything like the server response, so it's not helping.  Or put the JSON in a file with your other test data (including the formats which can't be put in Swift syntax easily at all, like binary formats).

I understand that some people really love automated testing above all else, but I can't figure out what sorts of bugs would be caught by this, which would not be caught by a solution that's 1/10th as complex -- and I can think of a few simple bugs which would still get missed by this.

twostraws,"Last year I wrote a book on Kitura, and tomorrow I'm releasing my book on Vapor ([both here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/server-side-swift)), and it's been an interesting experience. I'll probably write a blog post with more details, but broadly:

- Kitura uses Stencil for templates, whereas Vapor uses Leaf. If I had to choose, I'd go with Stencil – it's very similar to other template engines you might have tried, and offers a wider range of syntax.

- Both Kitura 2 and Vapor 3 have been updated to take advantage of Swift 4's `Codable`. Kitura's use of codable routing is very clever, but likely only to be useful in fairly simple CRUD applications. Vapor 3's use of codable is very impressive: most things can be encoded/decoded, which makes (e.g.) parsing forms a cinch.

- Vapor 3's use of async makes for a steep learning curve, but once you understand it – and realize it's endemic in the platform – you learn to lean on it more and more, and appreciate how clever it is. (Leaf integrates very tightly with it.)

- Both Vapor and Kitura have a database abstraction framework, although they are quite different in how they work. Having used both, I can tell you Fluent (Vapor's solution) is better. It takes a little setting up (although this is significantly better than it was in Vapor 2), but once you're done it's almost magic.

- Kitura supports things like Facebook/Google/GitHub authentication out of the box, which solves a whole category of problems. There are third-party frameworks for Vapor, but I don't know how well supported they are.

- There are some variances around the way they handle routing. Kitura offers things like regular expressions in routes, as well as a syntax that comes more naturally to folks who have used routing on other platforms. Vapor on the other hand does things in a more type-safe, albeit less flexible, way: you specify types right in your route. (Flip side: this lets you use Fluent model IDs as part of your routes.)

- Both Vapor and Kitura have command-line apps to help you create quickstart projects easily, but Kitura's version likes to generate projects that are significantly bigger. That might be useful for some, but I find it an annoyance.

- Both Kitura and Vapor have cloud solutions for you to deploy to. I haven't used either, but there's an old saying ""no one ever got fired for choosing IBM.""

All of that is straight off the top of my head; like I said, I'll probably write a more considered blog post with examples and so on. Some of the time it's six of one and half a dozen of another, but for me there are some clear winners: Kitura for templating, Vapor for database access, Kitura for simple routing, Vapor for being able to read/return practical any data model, Kitura for authentication, etc.

One stat you might find useful: the Kitura edition of my book is 78,000 words, whereas the Vapor edition of my book is currently 67,000 words – for the same projects. That says a lot about how much work Fluent does for you, and how good Vapor is at accepting/sending back complex data.",1514461877.0

I built a bundle of books that's designed to help you get started with a career building iOS apps: [the Swift Power Pack](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/swift-power-pack):

- Hacking with Swift teaches you the main concepts of Swift and a huge amount of the frameworks in iOS.
- Advanced iOS: Volume One teaches you more advanced techniques such as speech recognition, Siri integration, and iMessage apps.
- Pro Swift takes you further into Swift with more advanced techniques like operating overloading, generics, and POP.
- Swift Coding Challenges helps you test your Swift knowledge with the kind of problems that are regularly used in interviews.
- Objective-C for Swift Developers helps transfer your Swift knowledge to Objective-C, which is an older language that is often found in enterprise apps.
- Beyond Code teaches you important skills outside of coding, including regular expressions, the command line, and Git source control.

Combined, those books really will take you to junior developer level and put you in a great position to get a job making apps for real. The first book – Hacking with Swift – is available to [read online completely free](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) so there's no excuse not to get started :)

Rather than educating using a school or teacher in a more traditional sense I've taught myself a lot by developing opensource projects.

1. Code layouts are easier for large teams to work on.

  * Allow more reusable components.
1. Code layouts provide compile time guarantees for initialization, and navigation.
  * Storyboards require loosely typed strings.
  * There are 3rd party solutions that create string constants for you, but that adds complexity, and a dependency.
1. Compile time checked dependency injection is possible with code layouts (it's not with Storyboards).
  * Storyboards can still do dependency injection, but it's up to the developer to ensure everything is satisfied at runtime. If a new dependency is added, you will need to manually find every place you create that storyboard and satisfy the new requirements.
1. Storyboards make it easy to violate the SRP
  * ViewControllers need to inject services into other ViewControllers
  * You implicitly have routing in the View layer

All these reasons make writing unit tests significantly easier, and more reliable

That said, there are plenty of things that can go wrong.

I've had the team change during the project, for example. So I'd have a single junior developer left working for me.

I've also had developers who can't handle version control. They'd simply walk past developer's workstations with an USB stick, then have another guy code-dump it on SVN. As soon as I worked on the repo, they'd panic because OMG merging?!?!

The quality of the work depends on the developer who works on your project. Thus, it's essential that you interview him, and that he keeps working on your project. Specify that changing the team means that they broke the contract and thus you won't pay.

Interviewing is a special skill, with open questions. So don't ask, ""do you know git"", but ask, ""which git client do you use"", ""do you rebase or simply merge"", that sort of stuff.",1514104959.0

-	can explain the difference between structs and classes
-	can explain why you would use a struct vs why you would use a class
-	can explain clearly how a UITableView works, and how a UICollectionView works
-	can, given a screenshot of the iOS 11 App Store app, break down possible layouts where something is a UITableView, UITextView, etc
-	can explain the general differences between HTTP GET and POST, and using URLEncoding vs JSONEncoding

Bonus points:


-	familiarity with Codable and newer Swift things
-	familiarity with the differences between using storyboards and not using storyboards
-	familiarity with cocoapods
-	familiarity with popular libraries like Alamofire and SnapKit
-	familiarity with any backend frameworks and languages
-	familiarity with things like Dynamic Type, Safe Area Layout Guides, etc

clarkcox3,"Usually, when interviewing candidates:

* I ask about when you would use various language constructs over others (e.g. struct vs. class vs. protocol)
* I ask about Swift's error handling constructs, and how they differ from those of other languages (e.g. exceptions, error codes, NSError**)
* I ask about how Swift varies from other languages (e.g. Objective-C, Java, etc.) and, more importantly *why* it differs, and what you think the involved tradeoffs are
* I ask about various UIKit concepts and patterns (responder chain, delegation, data sources, notification)
* Even if you won't be working in Objective-C, it's important to have, at least, a working knowledge of it, as it has influenced the Mac and iOS frameworks and philosophies for decades.
* I present an existing iOS app, and ask ""How would you implement this?"" and ask them to explain why. If it's an app that I have access to the source of, I might also mention how it *was* implemented, and ask them why they think it might have been implemented that way, as opposed to the way they described.
* I ask some (basic) data modelling questions (e.g. ""Say you wanted to design a system to handle train fares and scheduling. What entities would be involved, and how would they be related?""). Even if you're only working on an app, it's  important to have *some* understanding of the way the backend is structured, and most apps have a server-side component these days.
* Beyond that, it's mostly basic CS stuff, algorithms, data structures, etc. Interviewers vary, but I tend to not harp too much on specifics (e.g. ""List the big-O efficiencies for these half dozen operations when applied to these structures""), as long as it's clear the candidate has a general knowledge (e.g. when an array is better than a linked-list, or when a hash table is a batter solution, what a binary search is, etc.). The odds that you will actually be asked to *implement* these structures in an iOS app are pretty low, but you will surely make *use* of them, and it's important to pick the right tool for the job.
* Sometimes, I'll ask CS questions with intentionally impossible or impractical answers to see the candidate's thought processes when solving a difficult problem

And, if you have a particular skill listed on your resume, you should be prepared for questions specific to that skill. Even if I am not an expert in that particular skill, I will seek help from a colleague who *is* so that I can ask sensible questions; it can be very disappointing to find that someone claims to know *X*, only to find out that they have minimal exposure to *X* and were just padding their resume.

I’m a professional iOS engineer and the thing I didn’t work hard on was unit testing. Our job requires us to unit test everything.

Other things you should know is what a sanity test is, user acceptance test, system integrated test, and multiple app environments. At least for us. Our work app has UAT and SIT environments for each month. That means test accounts only work on those environments when running the app. You can set the environment of an app in their settings.

Those are like the things I’ve learned since being at my job; everything else I already knew.

RedneckT,"Here's what I think your problem is. You need to have three separate structs instead of a struct nested inside a struct inside of a struct. Start at the lowest level of data you want to decode and each level you go up, use an array of the struct of the inside-level of data. I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense.

Here is your struct:

    struct Information: Decodable {
        var name: String

        struct WeatherDetail: Decodable {
            var main: [Temp]

            struct Temp: Decodable {
                var temp: String
            }
        }
    }

Simply change it like this and it *should* work:

    struct Information: Decodable {
        var name: [WeatherDetail]
    }

    struct WeatherDetail: Decodable {
            var main: [Temp]
    }
    struct Temp: Decodable {

nielsbot,"It's a form of indirection. You may want to refer to the variable itself, not the value inside it. For example an API like ""notify me when `view.frame` changes"". In that case you'd need to pass a `KeyPath` to your notification API.",1513832508.0
Catfish_Man,"One reason you might be confused is that the initial (Swift 4) implementation of KeyPaths is pretty minimal. Once there’s more runtime metadata available it becomes plausible to introduce stuff like “serialize/deserialize a keypath from a file”, which is useful for making tools like interface builder. If and when something like the Property Behaviors proposal (https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0030-property-behavior-decls.md) arrives, then exposing additional behavior knobs on properties by putting them on the KeyPath for that property makes a lot of sense.",1513846358.0

FWIW, I think Swift's ""typed"" keypaths are shit.",1513849865.0
twostraws,"Keypaths are a way of saying ""use this property to read your value"" rather than ""read this property's current value.""

The best example I can give is from Vapor 3, which is currently in beta. Vapor has a database layer called Fluent that can save and load Swift classes using a database. Fluent needs to know which of your class's properties identify it uniquely in the database, and you specify it something like this:

    static var idKey {
        return \.id
    }

That returns a keypath, not a value. It means ""when you want to know my unique identifier, look in my `id` property."" In comparison, a regular property – e.g. `myCategory.id` – means ""read the current value of `id`.""

To give you a real-world analogy, think of something like DNS. When you want to visit a website you enter reddit.com, and that domain name gets converted into an IP address like 151.101.193.140 that your web browser can then connect to.

While it's possible to enter that IP address by hand, it means when reddit.com changes address you won't get updated. Using the domain name – reddit.com – means your request will get looked up every time*, and converted to the IP address.

This is similar to keypaths: you're not asking for the specific value that is stored right now, you're asking for where to look for a value, so that when the value changes you can just read whatever it became.

eclectocrat,"Hi!

Are you expecting to target MacOS or iOS?

Without knowing more, here is my 2 cents. The Swift runtime is not realtime, so it's rather difficult to safely intercept realtime IOKit data (IOKit is a C++ framework that handles device communication). I remember as of last year the CoreAudio team at Apple did all their setup code in Swift, but managed the data stream in C or C++.

As far as your stream frequency, do you want your device to sample at 2.8MHz at 1 bit? Do you want a random USB audio device to sample 1bit DSD, or do you have a device that samples at 1bit DSD and want to know if you can handle the stream with Swift? I'm not sure how to answer the first question since I'm not really a device guy, but if you are on MacOS then you can quite easily write a user space USB driver, or with more effort, a kernel space IOKit driver that has the access you need to do the second. I do believe that iOS is a fair bit more strict on this point though.

Short Answer: there are API's that can give you low level access to hardware on MacOS, but you will probably access them in C++. You can then move the data to Swift and do whatever you want with it there, but only if you do not need realtime performance or craft your code extremely carefully to not ever trigger blocking code in the Swift runtime.",1513715437.0

teddim,"This looks great. I did something similar a while ago. Here are my thoughts:

- Is there any reason why `Matrix` is `BidirectionalCollection` and not `RandomAccessCollection`?
- It makes more sense to use `let` than `var` in the example code snippets where you don't mutate the matrix.
- Your `row(_:)` function returns an array – you could consider returning a custom `Row` collection that itself stores the matrix and the row/column you're looking into. It would turn `matrix.row(3)` from an O(n) operation into an O(1) operation.
- Similarly, your `rows()` function returns an array as well. What I did was create a custom `Rows` collection that stores the matrix and has the rows of the matrix as its `Element`s. Just like before, this turns `matrix.rows()` from an O(n) operation into an O(1) operation. An additional benefit of this is that you could get rid of the `row(_:)` function because `matrix.rows[3]` would do the exact same thing as `matrix.row(3)`.
- All the same things also apply to `column(_:)` and `columns()`.

And finally, if you're looking for a way to make matrix multiplication type-safe, look into the concept called ""phantom types"". Don't hesitate to ask me to clarify anything :)",1513601882.0

My brain just can't retain these viewcontrollers, delegates, datasource, I don't get it.

Let's wind back to an earlier part of the book, where I said this:

> The project template Xcode made for you gives you two important files: ViewController.swift, and Main.storyboard. A “view controller” is Apple’s way of letting you control one piece of content on the screen. It might occupy all of a window or just part of it, and some types of view controller exist just to manage other view controllers.

So, view controllers are there to control one piece of content in your app. In this program we have three, and the one you're facing in your post is `SourceViewController`. It's responsible for controlling a table of items, each showing the name of a picture used in the project.

Here's how the book explains the need for a custom class:

> When we created the split view controller, it provided us with two new view controllers: the one on the top is used to fill the left pane of the split view, and the one of the bottom is used for the right pane. These view controllers are constructed using a class called `NSViewController`, which provides basic functionality such as notifying you when it’s shown or hidden, adjusting its layout when the user resizes the window, and so on.

> “Classes” are one of Swift’s ways of creating new data types, and they let you create complex functionality by attaching custom code to the data types you define.

> What we’re going to do is create two custom versions of `NSViewController`, one for each side of our split view. This customization is called subclassing, or *inheritance*, because the new class you define inherits all the functionality of `NSViewController` and adds its own tweaks.

You've said you have no idea what the data source and delegates are, so again here's how they are explained in the book:

> Before we’re done with the table view, we’re going to make two further changes. Select “Table View” in the document outline, then Ctrl-drag from there to “Source View Controller”. When you release, choose “dataSource” from the menu that appears. Now do the same thing again, this time choosing “delegate” from the menu.

> If you’ve used `UITableView` on iOS before, this will all be very familiar: you just told IB that the `SourceViewController` class is responsible for telling the table view what it contains (its data source), and should also be notified when the user performs any actions (its delegate). We’ll be writing code for that soon, but first we have some more work in the storyboard.

To expand on that a little, Apple splits the control of tables into two parts to help you keep your code organized. One part is ""what's in this table?"" and the other is ""what should happen when users interact with this table?"" – data source and delegate, respectively.

I suspect the problem here is the disconnect between ""data source"" / ""delegate"" and `NSTableViewDataSource`/`NSTableViewDelegate`, and that's my mistake – something I can and will correct in the next update.

Again, I'm sorry you're having a hard time. That project chapter was over 10,000 words even though it's a simple app – there's a lot to learn when you're just setting out, and although I try to cover all bases clearly I have more work to do!",1513357873.0

Duckarmada,"Okay, so one of the primary design patterns in Mac and iOS development is the `delegate` pattern. You will encounter it just about every day, especially when using UIKit/Cocoa.
I'll do my best to explain it in the context described in this excerpt.

`SourceViewController` is a standard NSViewController - this is the base ViewController class. By default it contains some boilerplate methods that get called automatically.  

`SourceViewController` now holds an instance of `NSTableView.`Simply being the owner of the `TableView` isn't enough to fill it with information. The `TableView` has two requirements to do so - that a `DataSource` and `Delegate` have been assigned to it. The `TableView` asks the `DataSource` for the information needed to populate itself (how many sections/cells to show, laying out the cells, etc) and the `Delegate` provides the more interaction specific information (cell height, what to do when a cell is tapped, etc.). In the purest sense, these both technically function as ""delegates,"" but Apple has named them to be more descriptive.

Sooo, what's a delegate? From the perspective of the `TableView`, it's the class that has been assigned the tasks required to populate and display it. `SourceViewController` will at some point call `tableView.dataSource = self` which says ""Hey tableView, I'm gunna take over the dataSource tasks, so you should ask me for that information.""

Now, how does a class prepare itself to become a delegate? This is where `protocols` come into play. A protocol functions as an outline or blueprint of methods and delegates are nearly always created by writing a protocol. When you decide a class needs to conform to a protocol, that is - absorb its methods, you'll write `class SourceViewController: NSViewController, NSTableViewDataSource`. Everything after `NSViewController` are the protocols we want to adhere to - in this case `NSTableViewDataSource`. 

So now that we've assigned `SourceViewController` as the dataSource and established that it `wants` to conform to the `NSTableViewDataSource` protocol, we just have to add all of the required methods and implement them. The protocol/delegate methods will pass the `SourceViewController` some information (an index to a given cell for instance) and ask you return something the `TableView` can use.

Hope that helps and let me know if you want clarification - or even if your eyes glazed over at some point.",1513316973.0

The great thing is despite the numerous frustrations, when I see the app working, I think “How the hell did this work?” and review back the code to understand it further.

Stickerbox,"Sure, or you could just create a couple generic extension functions on UITableView so you don't even need to create/conform to a protocol:

    extension UITableView {
       func cell<T: UITableViewCell>(for cellType: T.Type, at indexPath: IndexPath) -> T {
        
          guard let cell = self.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: String(describing: cellType), for: indexPath) as? T else {
              fatalError(""Could not find cell with reuseID \(String(describing: cellType))"")

    }

Now when you want to register any UITableViewCell subclass you can just do: 

**tableView.register([MyCell.self])**

and dequeue it in cellForRow with:

**tableView.cell(for: MyCell.self, at: indexPath)** 

which will return you your UITableViewCell subclass rather than just the UITableViewCell superclass so you don't even need to force cast it to your type. All without having to create a protocol and conform to it.

SuperDuperTango,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""laggy"", since it looks like the animation starts immediately after the middle flag color changes (which I'm assuming is when you tapped the middle flag). 

But if you mean ""why does the animation show of the original VC's view underneath the destination VC's view, that's likely because the background of the destination view controller's view has a translucent background color (e.g. red, with an alpha of 0.7 or something).  

The UINavigationController's default ""slide in from right"" transition slides the original ViewController's VC to the left 30% while the destination ViewController's view slides in from the right.  If the destination ViewController's view has a non-solid background, you'll see the original ViewController's view during the transition.  

You can fix this by finding the same muted red as a solid color vs. using a more saturated red with an alpha < 1.

In the ChangeCityVC:

- I like to use //MARK: to divide my code into sections.  Example: ""//MARK: view lifecycle"" for all viewDidLoad,viewDidAppear type methods. Hit Ctrl+6 and see nice headers to your methods

- nice use of didSet.  I'm usually against calling a variable something like GR.  Call it ""tapGesture"" -- can never hurt to be more readable

- var delegate: sendCity? << delegates should be weak vars

In the ViewController:

- Take your locationManager code in viewDidLoad() and put it in a func called beginTrackingLocation().  Again -- readability is king

- Seriously, break your code into helper functions more often.  showErrorAlert(message:String?). If you plan on using this more often, extract this to a UIAlertController extension.

- Agree with /u/ilgabbo -- move your location manager code to the model

In your model:

- It's a little confusing to have your sendCity protocol tucked away in the Constants.swift file.  I know it seems weird, but make it its own file.

- I like your CompletionHandler constant!

- Give your WeatherModel a name like WeatherAPI to be more specific.  Calling it a Model is not entirely accurate -- its more like middleware. 

- It's totally fair game to do it the way you've done it, but making the WeatherAPI a static singleton should be considered in the case where you added to your application -- so that any VC could have access to it.

Hope this helps.  Feel free to ask questions -- I'm pretty good at this shit but I make mistakes, too.

",1513170474.0
jasamer,"Some good tips here already, I got a few more.


About the `sendCity` protocol... first, it should be uppercase. But there's more. In general, I'd call the delegate - very boring - `CityChangeViewControllerDelegate`. It's methods should pass the `CityChangeViewController` as a parameter first. For example `cityChangeViewController(..., didSelectCity:)`. One reason for this is that when someone reads the `ViewController` (btw, you should give that one a better name), when stumbling across the `cityChangeViewController(..., didSelectCity:)` function, it's immediately obvious that it's a delegate being called from somewhere.

Another general rule is that controllers shouldn't dismiss themselves. In general, your life is easier when the logical parent is in control. That is also a reason why we pass the `CityChangeViewController` as the first parameter in the delegate method I described above! All in all, in code:
    
    IBAction func changeCityButton(_ sender: UIButton) {
        if let cityText = cityTextField.text {
             self.delegate?.cityChangeViewController(self, didSelectCity: cityText)
         }
     }

Then, in `ViewController`:

     func cityChangeViewController(_ controller: CityChangeViewController, didSelectCity cityName: String) {
          controller.dismiss...
          ... Load your things
     }

What's the advantage? Now, the `ViewController` is in control, and it probably knows best what to do next. Maybe dismissing the city change controller should happen without an animation for some reason. Maybe data should start loading before the animation starts. Maybe, for whatever reason, the city change controller should be kept around for a little while longer. Anyway, if you do it this way, you gain flexibility.


One fairly specific thing about temperature: You have the parameter `tempNumber: Double`, which seems to be in Kelvin. You could call it `temperatureInKelvin` or something to make this a little clearer, but if you want to go all out, you can use Apple's `Measurement` struct. It can do temperature conversions for you! And you can format it using a `MeasurementFormatter`, if you want to be super professional about internationalisation.


Your error handling could also use some improvement. An `error` parameter should have the type `Error`. Then, either pass in the error you get from Alamofire, or create your own if an error happens. This way you have an easier time debugging your application, since you can see the error information while debugging in `ViewController`, and you can display better error messages for your users if you want (eg. separate messages for ""you're not connected to the internet"" and ""the server is down"").


One last thing: I'd name the class `WeatherData` something like `OpenWeatherMapService`, because it interfaces with that. (Theoretically, you could create a `WeatherService` protocol later and have a bunch of different specific services to choose from.) I'd use `WeatherData` for actual weather data, for example like this:

    struct WeatherData {
        let city: String
        let temperature: Measurement<UnitTemperature>
        let weatherType: String
    }

With that, you now can simplify some stuff: wherever you used to pass three parameters for city, temperature, and weatherId, you now pass `WeatherData`. That means your completion handler would be `typealias CompletionHandler = (WeatherData?,Error) -> Void` and in `ViewController` you'd have `func updateUI(with weatherData: WeatherData)`, for example.",1513185080.0

applishish,"Swift.String's `func+` calls StringCore's `append()`, which does a `_copyInPlace()`.  StringCore is:

    /// The core implementation of a highly-optimizable String that
    /// can store both ASCII and UTF-16, and can wrap native Swift
    /// _StringBuffer or NSString instances.

It's got special cases for ASCII-only strings and such.  Neat.  I'm not surprised that there's some cases where this is a little faster.

Possible downsides that I see:

 - Is it still faster with non-ASCII data?  They're using `encoding: .isoLatin1`, which has been declining in popularity for 10 years now.  If you loaded any non-ASCII characters (even the upper half of Latin-1), wouldn't NSString load it as UTF-16, causing the `_copyInPlace()` to maintain that encoding, and chew up a bunch of memory bandwidth, for no efficiency gains?
 - Is it still faster if the CSV file doesn't fit (twice) in your cache?  Copying data in memory isn't free.  They're decoding something called ""small.txt"", which apparently fits entirely in memory, but that's not always going to be the case.
 - Will it still be faster next month?  This is a pretty odd case, and Swift.String is still in flux.  To do this is to commit to running performance tests on all these hacks with every new compiler version.

This is an interesting observation, but it's not the sort of thing I'd put in production code.  I suspect (but can't confirm, because the actual parser seems to be for subscribers only?) that it's largely a symptom of writing a parser that is doing unnecessary random access.  If you only walk the stream forward, then encoding shouldn't matter, and you'll save a copy.

This is like the old C trick ""swap two ints without using a temporary variable"".  It's a fun trivia question, and might be useful if you really know what you're doing (like being able to ensure your CSV input file is always plain ASCII), but I wouldn't recommend it for general use.",1513116409.0

First, Swift still has some behavioral differences between Darwin and Linux.  I'd like to see better platform parity on the ""supported"" ones, before we start adding more.  I really don't want to debug (swiftc, webbrowser) combinations.

Second, the size.  I hope they have a really good tree-shaker.  For my desktop app, libswiftCore is over 5 MB, and there's another 5 MB of libswiftOtherStuff.  This doesn't even count the OS-level functionality that doesn't generally exist in web browsers.  For example, a default build of ICU today is over 30 MB, so if you use Core functionality that wraps ICU (i.e., lots of text interfaces in Foundation), you could potentially be transferring a whole lot of bytes.

I can see Swift-to-WASM as something that is technically possible, but not generally useful, due to the very different performance characteristics of the platform.  It might be feasible if you want to do some raw number-crunching and you avoid 90% of the stdlib, but in that case, C might be just as easy.

It’s a very simple compression scheme but immediately gives you what you’re looking for. And especially if you have a good average run length the RLE is probably compact enough that you can just keep it in memory, and when you iterate through the new array for change you just count each run and see if it matches the expected value.

Make sense?

{edit:formatting on the phone is hard}

Ps. The way I would implement this, roughly:

    start with empty RLE tuple

So, you really are interested in each ""run"" of a number, as the other reply indicated.

If you only have numbers from 0 - 9, the count of the current run is easy.  Create an array where each number in the array is the current run count of the number at that array index.  

When the number changes, you reset the count to 0 at the index of the new number found in the storage array.

All things considered, it is WAY behind ABI stability and a native concurrency syntax as far as the goals, but it is out there if you’re keeping up on the development.

The pain in the ass of it is in making a solution that makes the most people happy. I know what my ideal version would be, but there’s somebody out there who would  be happy to tell me why that’s the worst version of it. ",1512567276.0
,"I'm going to ask the dumb question but what's so bad about the regular expressions in Swift? 

I literally use this extension in every project: 

    extension String {
        func isValid(_ fieldType: FieldType) -> Bool {
            guard self.range(of: fieldType.rawValue, options: .regularExpression) != nil else {
                return false
            }
            return true
        }
    }

With a FieldType enum like this: 

    enum FieldType: String {
        case name = ""^[a-zA-Z\\-' \\.]{1,32}$""
        case ssn = ""^[0-9]{3}[0-9]{2}[0-9]{4}$|^[0-9]{3}\\-[0-9]{2}\\-[0-9]{4}$""
        case middleInitial = ""^[a-zA-Z]{1}$""
        ...etc
    }

So then I can do something like this: 

    if firstNameField.isValid(firstName) {

This isn't stopping you from accomplishing whatever you want to do with regular expressions.  You can even write your own wrapper, if you want, and there's already a bunch of nice open-source ones floating around.

I'm not entirely surprised that JS regex is faster than ICU in some cases, especially microbenchmarks.  JS has perhaps the weakest regex library still in use.  Eliminating most of your features is a common strategy for making a system faster.  (My Apple II boots faster than my Mac Pro, too.)  If that one does everything you need, and meets your performance needs better, then go for it.  On the flip side, it's lacking lots of features (like atomics) that would let it be even faster, if the regex were written for it.

ICU, in contrast, is one of the most powerful regex implementations today.  (It lacks arbitrary-length lookbehinds, but that's about it.  JS regex, of course, doesn't have any lookbehind support at all.)  Its Unicode support, of course, is without equal.  A Swift Character is a grapheme cluster, but unlike ICU, JS regex doesn't provide any mechanism to match one of these.

I would literally be unable to write most of my Swift regex using JS regex, because they're so feature-poor.  I don't doubt that some programs only need the features of JS regex, but don't go blaming an industrial-strength tool for clashing with your suit.",1512585140.0

It allows you to immerse yourself in native texts in any of over 30 languages without having to constantly switch out to different apps for tools like dictionaries and alphabet charts; everything you need is inside, and accessible with a single tap.

## CORE FEATURES

* Tap-to-define: defines a word with a popup dictionary.

* Tap-to-speak: speaks the word aloud (via text-to-speech)

* Add phonetic transcriptions: add phonetic transcriptive text like pīnyīn (for Chinese), hiragana (for Japanese), or Roman characters for any other language (e.g. Russian, Greek, etc.)

* Universal: There's large support for different language pairs (because not everyone is a native English speaker!), so e.g. a Bulgarian can learn Croatian using a Bulgarian<->Croatian bilingual dictionary.

## WHAT'S NEW

* The online dictionary's visual layout is vastly better now.

* Words will be highlighted upon tap (coming in next update).

* Soon to add a sorely needed first-time usage tutorial, using TNTutorialManager (coming in next update; see below for details).

## THE FUTURE

* Will add a back-end for better language support (only some system dictionaries support lookup of words that aren't presented in dictionary form, and Apple's Core Foundation tokenisers don't provide lemmatisation for all – or even most – languages).

* PDF support (have a mostly-working prototype, but have to concentrate on other tasks first).

* A Flashcard generator based on the words that you find yourself defining!

* I should probably also add a nag screen to encourage more reviews >_>

* Will populate /r/LinguaBrowse with more content once I have this important update out; but feel free to subscribe in the meantime!

twostraws,"1. There ought to be no way properties like that would be automagically connected to anything in a storyboard – you need to do it explicitly.

2. You can connect things through code if you really want, but it's pretty miserable compared to Ctrl-dragging.

3. The `@IBOutlet` part means nothing; it gets removed when your code is compiled.  However, Xcode scans your code for things marked `@IBOutlet` and offers them as options when Interface Builder is making connections.

4. The `weak` means you don't want to own the memory for this label. In this case, someone else owns it, so that's OK. Apple has flip-flopped over whether `weak` is needed in the past, because internally they don't agree. For example, all the IB engineers agree it isn't needed, but some influential frameworks engineers disagree. (They agreed on a compromise: whatever you select stays selected in the future; use [strong rather than weak](https://twitter.com/_danielhall/status/620717252216623104)!)
5. The `!` makes this an implicitly unwrapped optional. In this situation, what it means is ""this thing will start life with nothing inside the variable, but by the time I want to use it – and forever more – it will have something inside there, so don't make jump through the hoops that optionals normally need.""
6. The `_` means ""don't use a label for this when it's called externally."" If they had written `buttonPressed(sender: UIButton)` then the method would need to be called as `buttonPressed(sender: someSender)`. With the `_` in place, it can be called as `buttonPressed(someSender)`. Swift programmers mostly name all our parameters, but the Objective-C style was to make the first parameter part of the method name. This method is called from Objective-C, so it expects an unnamed first parameter.

I hope that helps!

b_t_s,"Apple's APIs are verbose as heck.  You can do a lot better by writing some basic convenience/helper/init methods and picking a good autolayout library(i suggest mortar).  I'd write that as:

    let label = UILabel(str: This is text"", color: .white)
    view |+| label
    label.m_center |=|  view

and line 2 there would  be shared by most/all subviews like

    view |+| [label, someView, anotherView, etc] 
 
so really only 2 lines for that view.  Also, I tend to do the creation/styling in one place(at the point of declaration) and the layout in another which makes the layout code a lot easier to read.  Mortar also has a VFL style syntax which is type checked(unlike Apple's) and once you learn a couple operators, it's extremely readable even for large complex layouts.  Most views end up being 2 to 5 lines total for creation, styling, and layout once you've eliminated all the boilerplate(like isActive, translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoContraints, frame:, etc, etc)  Also note that builder style methods are nice for the styling.  Say your label needed to have a border

    class myVC: UIViewController {
        let label = UILabel(str: This is text"", color: .white).rounded(3).border(1, color: .red)

This would be like 7 lines with Apple's APIs, and note how it allows label to be a non optional let, which is nice.

Now you can’t tell during runtime which parts of your app have strong references to those objects, and also if they’re being mutated concurrently. 

If you pass objects from above, you can ensure that at tear down (say, when a user logs out of your app), there’s no shared state lingering in your app.

Also, if you pass objects from above you’ll have a better time writing unit tests. If I’m a class A and I need access to class B inside my implementation if someone comes along to write unit tests for A they’re going to have a hard time mocking out B so that their unit test is isolated and can’t be affected by B potentially changing in future. If you pass B into A (say, via the initializer in A), in your unit test for A you can just pass in a mock of B. 

In general, singletons can be tricky and introduce uncertainty to your app because it can be hard to reason about what parts of your app access a given singleton at runtime. It might not seem like a big deal for you now if you’re working on your own app but once you join a large team anything you can do to narrow the scope in which an object can be accessed (and potentially mutated) at runtime is a good thing.

madiyar,"You have two options:

1. Hackish way: Your UITableViewCell will consist of three images.

2. Use UICollectionView, [a good tutorial from raywenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/136159/uicollectionview-tutorial-getting-started)",1512136518.0
klarkzen,"Try using a UICollectionView. Then you can make an IBOutlet from the collectionView in your controller and easily draw a 3 column layout with a function like this:

    func drawLayout(columns: CGFloat) {
          let layout = UICollectionViewFlowLayout()
          let imageSize = UIScreen.main.bounds.width / columns - 1
          layout.itemSize = CGSize(width: imageSize, height: imageSize)
          layout.minimumInteritemSpacing = 1
          layout.minimumLineSpacing = 1
          collectionView.alwaysBounceVertical = true
          collectionView.collectionViewLayout = layout
          
          if #available(iOS 11.0, *) {
               collectionView.contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior = .automatic
               
               // On iOS 11 and more specifically the iPhone X
               // space the collectionView correctly so the first and last rows aren't
               // partially covered by the navigation bar
               layout.sectionInsetReference = .fromSafeArea
          } else {
               self.automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets = true;
          }
    }

And in your viewDidLoad() simply specify the number of columns you want using `drawLayout(columns: 3.0)`",1512160199.0
David_Edward_King,"Really the only valid way to do this is using a UICollectionView, not a UITableView. This allows for a lot more customisation.

KarlJay001,"I don't remember if there are different categories of tasks, but if not, then wouldn't you be putting two tasks in the same queue where one has to wait for the completion of the other?

Without looking at the code, I'm guessing you have an interdependency between the two tasks.  If so, you run the risk of a lock up.

Why wouldn't you open a new thread for another task?  You have to do some fine tuning to get threads to not lock each other up, it's really a case by case deal.",1512120220.0

rezarekta,"If you want to present a list of items, either a Table View or a Collection View would work just fine, and their API is pretty similar, there's really no ""right answer"" here. 

My rule of thumb is that I usually go with a collection view if I want a more flexible layout (i.e. if I plan on presenting more than one item per row on larger screens, like an iPad, or if I want it to scroll horizontally instead of vertically). But like I said, their delegates/datasource being pretty similar in terms of implementation, swapping one for the other is pretty easy; I often start with a tableview and if needed, I switch to a collection view... ",1512103789.0
KarlJay001,"Some are of the view that collection view will do everything a table view will do and more.  One tutorial line uses the collectionview for everything and I haven't seen him use tableview yet.

You can double check, a good side-by-side of what each offers, but IIRC, collectionview offers everything and more that a tableview offers.  If that's the case, why bother with tableview?",1512105677.0
