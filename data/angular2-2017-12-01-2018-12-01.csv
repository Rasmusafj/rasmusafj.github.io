mi5ter,"The projects apparently uses a very old CLI version, I guess it does not work with node 10. At least the binary it tries to download does not exist, there is no `linux-x64-64_binding.node` at https://github.com/sass/node-sass/releases/tag/v4.5.3

You could try to install a higher `node-sass` version before doing your `npm install`. If the package already exists in the node_modules folder npm won't try to downgrade it, as far as I know.

Or:
You could manually download a working `linux-x64-64_binding.node` and set the environment variable SASS_BINARY_PATH to point to it. Then it would skip the download and use the local version.

Or:
You could downgrade node.

This plus designing your route component to make full use of lifecycle events and building an rxjs stream that combines the latest state to grab your data and update the URL as a side effect. 

E.g.

Oninit - 
1. parse params from route snapshot and populate filter form etc
2. Setup stream to listen to filter, sort, page change
3. Subscribe to that and load data when anything changes. Navigate to the current route with updated values as query params as a side effect (tap)

SyreiX,"First I would place the JS and CSS files into an assets folder (eg.: `src/assets/js` and `src/assets/css`)  
If you want to use the CSS in a component, then you have to import it in the component.css file like this: `@import ""assets/css/theme.css"";`  
You can also import the CSS file into the `styles.css` file in the src folder, so it will be global and don't have to import it into every component one-by-one.  
Using the JS files, you have to import the required JS file into the component.ts (or .js) file like this: `import * as myScripts from ""assets/js/some-scripts"";`  
You can call the functions in the component like this: `myScripts.someScript();`

Bjeaurn,"If you want to stay in the realm of observables as you described (honestly, subscribing is a very valid option; don't consider it 'outside of the observable realm'), you're going to have to do filtering on the server side and recall the API with your filtering queries. Else you've given your control of the data to the HTML.

&#x200B;

The easier and more explicit way; without roundtrips would be to manage your data manually.

You subscribe in your ngOnInit() (don't forget to manage unsubscription or pass it the \`first()\` operator if one retrieval will be enough), and you manage your filtering on the resulting array.

I think you quickly said you would know how to do this, so I'll refrain from setting up a StackBlitz now.

spacechimp,"Interfaces are an OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concept. They allow you to say that an object must have certain attributes, but doesn't have to be a specific type.

Lets use the example you linked: You could have different types that extend ChipColor -- let's say Pantone (that has an additional ""pms"" property) and Cmyk (that has additional ""c"", ""m"", ""y"", and ""k"" properties). Any code that expects a ChipColor doesn't have to care whether it gets a Pantone or Cmyk object -- it only cares that it at least meets the description of a ChipColor.

Interfaces are useful in testing as well. Objects that use interfaces can easily be replaced with ""mock"" versions that simulate specific conditions that normally would be difficult to reproduce.

As for your question ""how to know when you are supposed to use them?"": The answer is that *good* OOP strives to use them as much as possible. There is even an often-repeated saying: ""program to an interface, not to an implementation"".  [There's some good discussion and more examples in this StackOverflow thread.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/383947/what-does-it-mean-to-program-to-an-interface)",1543424405.0
xSilentium,"Interfaces are like contracts. If you expose a function that returns an array of Chips you basically tell the user ""I promise you the return value will be an array of objects that will definitely have those fields of a Chip""

If you return `any[]` the user knows it's an array but not what's inside. Could be strings right? Let's say the function name is `getChips() any[]`. You might know that those have a color. So is the field named color? Or maybe colour? With interfaces you will also know what type that field has. I could define a color as a string or an object which is rgb number values etc.

It also works the other way around. I'm your module imports you have, for the sake of the explanation, an `Component[]`. You can't put in a string there, because the angular developers added the interface type. If those types don't match, you get an compiler error as said below.
(Also it helps with IDE auto complete ;) )

When to use interfaces: short answer: always. JavaScript allows a lot of weird implicit type conversation (just check out /r/ProgrammerHumour for a week) and a lot of code would run without having any errors but weird results. So as soon as you have objects I would recommend using interfaces. Try to avoid `any` as much as possible. If you really don't know the structure of the object you can use `unknown`.

I highly recommend reading about interfaces in tutorials and the official documentation. They are everywhere.",1543423416.0

We've used NgRx to great effect on our team, and we have gone without in the past. I like to make it a pros/cons because I agree that a lot of the time it's not necessary.

Pros

Great separation between services and components. We often have a developer work on a service and another on the component simultaneously, which works great when you know beforehand what you will be getting from the store. 

Components and services are dead simple. They do one thing. If you also use the container pattern, then components are simplified even further and care only about input/output. 

Single source of truth. Components don't each have their own state, there is only one place you need to look. 

Getting a specific sliver of state into a component is repeatable, even dull, affair. 

State reuse. This is very doable without redux, but the pattern makes it easier. 

Redux tooling like the time traveling debugger. 


Cons 

Sooo much boilerplate. 

Effects and the corresponding RxJs are difficult, complicated, and require new team members significant ramp up time. 

Absolute overkill for small projects.

olzn-,"I think it's nice when you need some state management, and when doesn't you, right?

It kinda forces you to struct your application in a certain way, so you can manage your state one place, and not all around in your components. And you have some guidelines for new developers in the app, how to manage it.

Although, the app's scope need to be somewhat big, before I would consider implementing it. And sometimes a service could be more than enough to hold some state for me.",1543067465.0
MetalMikey666,"So speaking purely about redux when applied to react (the only use case I find a need for it) - it has a hook-in library called react-redux which IMO is basically mandatory if your application is going to be anything more than just a simple 2/3 component architecture. More specifically, some kind of state management is mandatory (so, if not redux, then something).

The main benefit IMO aside from all the nice dev tools and the increased state visibility is basically that you don't need to thread as many props through your components - if you don't use a centralised state you end up with any shared state existing in a common ancestor of two components that need it, but that state in itself makes no sense to be there, and you thread it down through components that don't care about the state either. Very quickly your codebase becomes difficult to read and manage.",1543085874.0
kylecordes,"Over here we have built a variety of complex systems, some using this pattern (via NgRX with Angular) and others not.

Based on that experience, going forward we are using this pattern less. Only when the situation really calls out for it. Why?

Because it does a great job of handling certain kinds of complexity, but it also creates other kinds of complexity and verbosity.

For example: if you create data and state flow through your application by wiring up a network of observables, out-of-the-box mostly everything stays in the right order; in particular, a series of things that happen, stay in the order they happened. While if you are building on the redux pattern, and shatter all those things that happen into separate actions, you find yourself responsible for managing the asynchronicity as well as ordering concerns. Or put differently: in some ways a set of observables wired together provides a higher order, more abstract way of managing data and state flow than the redux pattern. Wielded well, this can yield a correct system with less effort, less code, less complexity.

However, at the same time I think the redux pattern is fantastic as part of one's learning path. By decomposing everything that happens in an application in this way, you get to really think in depth about the meaning of things that happen (actions, novelty, input), state, and output. So I recommend learning the pattern deeply if you are working in modern web applications, while the same time recommend choosing other patterns for most applications.

- [my prod env](https://github.com/LandOfTheRair/landoftherair/blob/master/src/client/environments/environment.prod.ts)

So, I don't think using environments is foolish, and it's a bit of an exaggeration to suggest so. The glaring differences between my two environment files:

- a different server to connect to (local vs prod)
- a different url for the client to use as its base url (localhost vs prod)
- ideally, different auth0 domains or clients but I was too lazy to do that. 
- different stripe tokens
- different rollbar tokens (not used on local because it would spam rollbar)
- compile-time hashes of my assets so I can cache bust on prod
- a build identifier

There are also some different flags set depending on what environment is being built, which is another great reason to use it.

This is just for me doing local dev and deploying to prod (on netlify). This is not something I could easily do with one environment file.

Create additional methods in the service to allow modifying the data.

creazero,`ng-content` + `*ngIF/*ngSwitch` if you can determine the needed object.,1542026590.0
Sipredion,"If I understand correctly, then one way you could do it is add a function to your click handler and pass in the `text` as a parameter.

In the function you can do a switch on your incoming parameter and either route if you need to route or do something else if you don't want to route.

Edit: Was on mobile, back at my computer.   

So in your example specifically you could have something like this: 

menu.service.ts: 
```
export let menuItems: Array<MenuItem> = [
 { 
   text: 'CUSTOMERS',
   route: ../insert-route-here },
 { 
   text: 'CASHREGISTER',
   route: ../insert-route-here2 }
]
// etc.
```

menu.component.html:    
(I'm not sure what the Menu-Item component looks like, but basically it would be the following:)
```
<ul>
    <li *ngFor=""let item of menuService.items"">
        <menu-item [item]=""item"" (click)=""navigateOrSomething(item)"">
        </menu-item>
    </li>
</ul>
```
menu.component.html:     
```

constructor(private router: Router) {}

navigateOrSomething(item) {
  switch (item.text) {
    case 'CASHREGISTER':
      this.router.navigateByUrl(item.route);
      break;
    case 'SOMETHING_ELSE':
      this.doSomethingElse();
      break;
  }
}
// etc
```

A few things though. Is there a reason you're exporting a `let` from your menu.service? It looks like you have a class already called MenuItem. So what you could do is loop through an array of menu labels and create a `new MenuItem(options: object)` and pass in the text and route.
   
Also, you don't need to export it as a `let`, because there's a good chance you won't be changing it again. So best practice is generally to export as a `const` instead from a separate `model.ts` file (someone shout at me if I'm wrong).

mattstrom,"Several different Angular mechanisms cover the capabilities of HOCs in React.

>connecting to state managers

Dependency injection and services cover this use cases. DI can be used whenever you need to provide a sort of ""global"" value to a component, such as React-Redux's `@Provider` or many HOCs named something like `@withValue`.

>injecting lifecycle hooks

I'm not sure what the Angular analogue is here because Angular has a fundamentally different change detection mechanism from React. `@Input` decorators, async pipes, and observables might cover what you are talking about here. There is also `ChangeDetectorRef` with which you can force an update with `markForCheck()`.

>creating a local state store

Again, this capability can be achieved with DI and services. There is also the concept of hierarchical injectors wherein modules and components can redefine providers so that, for instance, a component and its children can use a different service from the rest of the application.

>interacting with browser APIs or the DOM

Angular's lifecycle is also fundamentally from React's because it doesn't use a virtual DOM. An Angular component becomes aware of its host element as soon as the `afterViewInit` event. It can then use an injected `ElementRef` to inspect the `nativeElement` that it is bound to. For more fine grained control, it can inject and use `Renderer2` to manipulate the DOM directly.

&#x200B;

Templates and content projection are two other mechanisms for reusing logic. With content projection, a ""higher-order"" component can designate sections into which outside components can be wrapped by the ""HOC"". There is some overlap here with React's concept of dynamic components, but you can achieve some more reuse by employing Angular's `ngAfterContentInit()` lifecycle event and the `@ContentChild()` decorator.

    /** Rearranges header and footer. */
    @Component({
        selector: 'app-hoc',
        template: `
            <ng-content select=""footer""></ng-content>
            <ng-content select=""header""></ng-content>
            <ng-content select=""section""></ng-content>
        `
    })
    export class HocComponent implements AfterContentInit {
        @ContentChild(InnerComponent) inner;
    
        ngAfterContentInit() {
            this.inner.doSomething();
        }
    }
    
    @Component({
        template: `
            <app-hoc>
                <header>I will be at the bottom</header>
                <footer>I will be at the top</footer>
                <section>
                    <app-inner></app-inner>
                </section>
            </app-hoc>
        `
    })
    export class MyComponent {}

NgTemplates are another powerful way to reuse behavior. A ""HOC"" component can accept a template which it can then instantiate into itself and bind values to. Admittedly this is a more painful technique than it might be in React but it does the job. This is how many Angular component libraries allow you to customize components.",1541878754.0

We've finally settled into doing it server side with [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).

We have a node REST API service we keep stand alone only for pdf generation. We typically use React on the front end but I see no reason this can't work with Angular. Here's our flow:

1. We send whatever container node or whatever HTML (using refs in React to grab the elements from the actual DOM) we want to render to pdf, along with the required css, directly to an endpoint that is created for the particular front end project. (in case any additional customization is needed server-side)
2. Sanitize the HTML on the server. 
3. Send the HTML to an instance of puppeteer to be rendered and use puppeteer to generate the pdf.
4. Send the resulting pdf back on the response to the front end.

Pretty simple overall. Puppeteer has a great API and documentation, and does better at consistently creating well formatted pdfs from HTML & CSS than any other method we've used. It's minimal effort. Our clients get their pdfs and are happy. We don't have to work to hard to do it so we're happy also.",1541823205.0

kromem,"The challenge here is that it isn't really ""navigation"" in Angular.

You're correct in that the approach would be styling a list of views accordingly.

Where you are going to run into trouble is managing adding navigation items into that list.

What I'd recommend is having a fixed number of ""pages"" possible, and simply ngIf them based on if activated.

That said, not only is this going to end up being a big issue from a performance standpoint (keeping multiple navigation windows open/active concurrently even when not being viewed), it also looks like problematic UX.

If this is in a browser, it already has similar functionality: tabs. If in a dedicated application, maybe there'd be an argument for a multitasking view, but it still seems like a UX anti-pattern to me, replicating OS level multitasking at an application level.

A better approach might be having an animated route stack that a user could toggle and scroll though, replacing a given index with subsequent navigation. This would be functionally identical, would allow for not keeping multiple views active, and would be easier to execute on. Basically the same exact thing except instead of window views it could be done as a stack of named ""cards"" that are scrolled through.

With this approach, the challenge will be keeping state on old views. You'll need to make sure state is being saved to the history queue in some standardized way as well.",1541630118.0

That's not entirely easy.

One option that might work is to take snapshot images of the pages using something like dom-to-image. Or if the images just need to be representative of the pages, you might get away by creating the images on the server using server side rendering.

Doing this on the client without something like dom-to-image, or tricks like xhtml in svg, is going to be tricky. Firstly, you need to design your components so that they can be displayed on any route. Then, when you need to display multiple pages, you send component types to a factory that constructs these components and places them into something like a list.

The latter can be done using the ViewContainerRef.createComponent function.

Then you need to layer the components on top of each-other, and use opacity, css 2D transform, etc, to scale and position them.

spacechimp,"[Angular contributors recognize this as a point of confusion as well.](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/17825) It took a while to begin to wrap my brain around this myself. I've still got a way to go, but this is my understanding so far:

If you have a simple app, and your service is fine as part of AppModule then you are fine with providedIn: 'root'. If you need to organize your code further, then you have additional considerations.

CoreModule is the most logical place to look for singleton services. There are other things that might need to be singletons as well, such as certain directives, interceptors, and guards, so having a CoreModule can still help with organization even if the services within are technically provided by root. Even if you don't have an explicit ""CoreModule"", each module that contains singletons should be built [similarly to how you would build a CoreModule](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#prevent-re-import-of-the-core-module) anyway.

If a module needs to have both singletons and non-singletons (such as directives), the [forRoot() / forChild() convention can help you to split those imports up](https://angular.io/guide/singleton-services#forroot) \-- so lazy-loading will not cause the services to be re-provided. This is makes a module do double-duty as both a mini CoreModule and a SharedModule. See RouterModule as an example of this technique.

Flex-layout is recent (still in beta IIRC) but works fine for me. 
Material, well... at first I thought it was the perfect library for Angular, turns out it's fine but it has a shitton of open issues and I encounter 2-3 bugs already documented in an issue every week. You always find a workaround but you have to understand the philosophy of the library so that you don't waste time and find good workarounds. 
Material still allowed me to build a couple nice projects and I've used like 90% of the components/directives it offers (and tried the most niche ones in personal projects). It still saved me a lot of time, especially these ones recently : dialogs, stepper, flat tree (nested tree is a maintenance nightmare tbh). 
And it's not really the Material's team fault. Building on things like today's browser, CSS rules, with the infinite screen sizes that exist, I respect their job and I love the design.

I believe what you are actually asking is about component libraries.

No component library is better or worse for CRUD. CRUD is probably the most basic usage case for any app, and every component library can handle it well.

Where the libraries differ are things like styling, theming, validation - more complex things like that. None of those are essential to a CRUD app.

So the answer to your question is, it makes little or no impact to the functionality of your app which one you pick.

They don't trust their undeveloped engineering aesthetics to actually compare and choose a technology.  Most don't bother, and would have nothing to base it on, anyways.  

So, they defer to the 'online community', which is really just a horde of kids who follow trends.  There is an anxiety fueled gullibility which is extremely susceptible to the snowball effect.  The fear of failure runs deep.  So a single technology choice goes viral, because it feels safe, and becomes the de facto winner.  This then leads to small companies using it, putting it in role descriptions on job boards, which feeds back more when bigger companies start to copycat, and whang.

These choices have absolutely nothing to do with what is a better choice in a technical sense.  It becomes totally about fitting into the online group-speak and job scene.  If you achieve success using technology X, then you fall in love with it, rave about it on forums, write blogs, and everyone who couldn't know better sees that, and follows suit.  It's that simple.

They're both MVVM frameworks and conceptually very similar.  If you understand the purpose of and how to work with one, you can switch pretty easily.

I went from an angular project to a react project about a year ago.  Here's what I tell anyone who asks me to compare:

- I'd recommend angular to someone starting out in modern front end.  Having it make decisions for you and include lots of things out of the box (http client, routing, etc) lets you focus on the new concepts you're dealing with.

- If you don't need all of those things angular makes you bring in, React might be a better choice (turns out not everyone needs forms and routing and what not).

- JSX beats the ever living shit out of angular templates. 

- Either choice, TypeScript is the shit.

- The react apps (3 in total) are at least as big as the angular app I worked on (the largest is probably 3-5x bigger) and my react apps load instantly while the react app I worked on took up to 15 seconds to bootstrap.  I've been told in other threads we were probably doing it wrong, but the fact that I can do it that wrong is saying something.

- Personally, I find the service/singleton/dependency injection setup in angular unnecessary.  The module system was awfully cumbersome as well.  In React I just import shit and go.

guilhermeoc97,"Angular is:

* for building apps with a very strict structure;
* for when you're starting a project from the ground-up;
* for when your team consists mainly of OO programmers;
* for when you need to build an app that works on every major browser without having to worry about compatibility and polyfills.

React is:

* for building lighter and faster apps;
* for starting and converting JavaScript projects into React really quick;
* for when your team consists of frontend programmers;
* for when you need to make your app as simple as possible to ""just work"" (an MVP, if you will).

Sure, those are the points I see about Angular and React, but there are a lot of exceptions to the rule. React is popular because the learning curve for people that only mess with JS is flatter for learning React than for learning Angular.

There were actually two different scenarios I ran into:

&#x200B;

1. Where the same font-face was being used on the page it just wasn't always loaded on time, for which I added this for rendering the graph (limited browser support in my environment so not sure how many these solutions actually hit):

        		this.initGraph();
        	}
        }

2. Where the dynamically generated graph was the only thing on the page so the font would *never* load at all without some prodding (this one literally only needed to work in Chrome and isn't actually part of an Angular component in this case so YMMV, but you should be able to get the idea):

Last time I checked they were 16/24/36/48dp etc. Make it fully responsive so that the margins change depending on screen size according to the specification. This current version has no use as it is.

Bjeaurn,"Hey there! There's a couple of things you will need to consider.

Having a centralized error handling system (a combination of a component, service and maybe a HTTP_INTERCEPTOR will work for your situation just fine!). 

In that case, you could consider catching some of the situations you may occur, like a `500 internal server error` or can't connect to server (timeout) or database down error (`504 or something?), which I would handle with a general `HTTP_INTERCEPTOR`, losing connection (component), etcetera.

Handling specific cases per service/component is also recommended, however I wouldn't put this in an interceptor. You may be willing to handle a `404` differently in a specific component or service than you would in general. And you don't want to be triggering errors all over the application when a service doesn't return any results per example.

I hope this helped you guide your decisions!",1540554103.0

avin_kavish,"Not confusing at all. One approach would be to use web sockets to push changes to the client. Data sources like mongoDb have change streams that the server can listen to and push via something like [socket.io](https://socket.io)\\SignalR\\Action Cable depending on your back-end. This would create near real-time updates for your client.

If your data source does not support change streams then some sort of polling system as you described would be the way to go. The polling time period is dependent on the use case.

dryadofelysium,"It sounds like you understood \*ngIf very well actually and have a different issue.

So it depends on what exactly it is that you are trying to do, but let's say your app-child-component is something that just wants to show the time or whatever, and you want to be able to update it with new data/re-sync the time/whatever.

You could do that in several ways. One is to use an Input, like this:

<app-child-component \[time\]=""myTime""> (in the template)

myTime in this case would be an object that is defined in your app-component, e.g.

myTime = Date.now();

Then, in the app-child-component, you define

@Input() time: any;

And the app-child-component's template could show the data with <p>{{ time }}</p>

This is just one of many ways to do it, it really just depends on what you are trying to do. Probably you just need some changes in your app-child-component, because it sounds like you do \*something\* in the constructor or ngOnInit() method in the app-child-component and just want that to be updated constantly. Depending on what you are doing there, Observables (RxJS) would probably be the thing you should look into.

- it's impossible to store securely in the client side. Assume anything you put there can be reverse engineered.

- that doesn't mean you shouldn't store auth credentials for API calls client side, it just shouldn't be things like passwords

- A common user pattern is have the client authenticate with your server using their username and password, and return a JSON web token (JWT). Store this JWT client side and all subsequent requests will use the JWT. The token can have an expiry and permissions variables.

- if you don't have clients with user names or passwords, you need to use CORS to secure your site.

lugovsky,"I can think about a solution, where you can do that without middle tier using only a web server like nginx. For example, instead of login/password you will send a token, which would be your login/password transformed using symmetric encryption with a private key into token. This private key would be available only for nginx, and it would basically decrypt this token and transform the data into appropriate login/password headers (or Basic HTTP Auth header if you have it). Some additional verifications (like expiry, IP address verification etc.) can be made it this point. Though I'm not 100% sure whether it's possible to do this only using nginx config or if there's some plugin to do that, but nginx is quite extensible and in general this shall be possible.

&#x200B;

BUT. 

* The solution above is not really generic, that's why there won't be many tutorials that would help you. Most of the time you will have to deal with boring documentation pages and invent your own solutions.
* Even if you manage to do that, you can't have guarantee, that token won't be compromised as it would be accessible from the client side and your login/password would leak or if hacker would be able to access your private API using just this token.

That's why it would be always better to have some middle tier that would proxy your requests to private API. As an additional security measure, I would also made that API accessible only from the IP address of your middle tier using firewall settings. In case you have middle tier, you can implement some good authentication strategy using JWT or oAuth2 (if you need more security). If you go this direction, you can also look at @nebular/auth package that provides some convenient API for token management and request signing for different authentication strategies.

Also you can automate the StateTransfer from the server to the client (which is what you are trying to do in the beginning of your ngOnInit I think) with the official TransferHttpCacheModule [https://github.com/angular/universal/blob/master/docs/transfer-http.md](https://github.com/angular/universal/blob/master/docs/transfer-http.md)",1540253234.0

IX-Hispana,"The first step to clean up the HTML would be to identify blocks that are easily taken out and make them components. Those components just display the HTML, their classes do nothing other than to receive the appropriate inputs and outputs. This is just an emergency measure to reduce the number of lines in the data table template and make it less overwhelming. In general, when adding a feature, make a small component instead of adding HTML to an existing template. This makes it easier to separate in your mind what you're doing from the rest of the stuff going on in the template.

A medium term goal is to switch to [the CDK data table](https://material.angular.io/cdk/table/overview). It's officially supported by Angular and will take a lot of work off your hands.

A long term goal is to design the API of the data table component (more to learn about how to make flexible components in general than to actually make a data table - you should use the CDK one if possible), and then use content projection and ngTemplateOutlet to implement it.

So have you tried using a regular `Subject`?

Also, in general your rxjs isn't using the `pipe` method.  Are you still using Angular 4?

And why `take(1)` here?  That means you are only using the first emission.  If you want later emissions you don't want that.

Also, why `!!user`?  If `user` is an empty object, `{}`, then that will still evaluate to `true`.  Are you intentionally passing `null` or some other falsy value?  Either way, I would suggest never setting up code to rely on automatic coercion.  Explicitly check one of the fields inside the `user` structure or some other check.

You'd have to give a better example of what isn't reliable and causing issues.

On the other hand, I wouldn't say that your proposed change to the flow is wrong.  That method can work too although you need to worry about all routes still and not just the main page in order to support deep linking.

Depending the importance of speed vs separation of concerns you could consider setting up one repo containing

Each with their own p.j - that way you can set up your deployment and scripts in the root of that project. The argument for 1 repo containing two independent apps is that while you are scaffolding things you might need to keep changes in your app and api in sync. Deployments are much easier if you only maintain 1 codebase.

tme321,"This is really hard to follow.  You'll need to format it better or provide a stackblitz or something.

But from what little I can tell here it kind of looks like you don't understand asynchronous code.  I say that specifically because of the line:

`this.geolocation$ = of(this.globalObjectsService.getUserGeolocation().getGeolocationData()); `

Here it seems like `getGeolocationData` would still be in the `AcquiredStates.READY_TO_ACQUIRE` state since nothing else is setting the user's state.

And that function is honestly a mess anyway. `getGeolocationData` seems to be doing 2 different things.  Why?  It should do 1 thing, either request a new set of data or return the currently cached data.

My advice is back up and start from a simpler example.  Just set `geolocation$` to an http request and then pipe it to the template as you are doing right now.  There's a lot of other code in here that is kind of wonky and it's hard to tell where the problem lies because of it.

So just start with something like:

    this.geolocation$ = this.httpClient.get(...);

    {{((geolocation$ | async | json))}}

Concurrency is a question for your infastructure - i.e. web and db servers, load balancers, scaling.

Supports input validation - literally everything does

Has technology for error handling - of course !!!

Hooks to RESTful services - what?

Has CORS Support - is controlled by the browser and allowed on the backend server by setting headers

Has a mobile centric development flow - yes look at Nativescript or React Native

Supports bookmarks per page and history - yes you can control browser history with the history API in js

Supports OAUTH and SSO - It's your job to code it.

Supports Single Page Interface - You mean SPAs? That's the whole point.

Can support Automated Testing - Angular CLI generated projects do out of the box, thousands of JS libraries for that

Support compression and delivering functionality - This is done by the web server

Supports heavy markdown specifically common mark for document creation - Find yourself a markdown/commonmark editor, it has no relation to Angular or React.

This was originally discussed when Flux was announced from Facebook -- specifically to address some of their messenger badges not going away on read messages. I forget the talk, but it was very good. How that manifests in Angular is [NGRX](https://github.com/ngrx/store). It's a data store as the source of truth.

So if I was writing this I would have you header component call the `RefreshPageAction`. Then it will fire, make whatever calls you need, and reduce a new state. Then your page will have it's observables receive new values by way of subscriptions and populate itself with new data from one singular source of truth.

This takes a fair bit of knowledge on Observables but is the much better architecture, imho. If you want to avoid the store/observables/rxjs in general, I would recommend emitting a refresh event as it's a more common pattern that emitting the data itself.",1539634194.0

Because APP_INITIALIZER has no guarantee of order the services where getting an empty configuration file!

,"Okay so if the menu structure is the same for everyone and does not change then it can be part of the app. You can update the app directly by setting up a automated deployment system.

If it changes but is the same for everyone, then you can have your reverse-proxy/http server cache that particular HTTP response. the request does not need to even hit the backend.

If it changes per user then you can't explicitly cache it on a reverse-proxy or any other intermediary cache server. It is possible to get the browser to send an E-tag containing a hash of the cached response and for the server to send back a 304 status response saying the resource is indeed not modified. This prevents a cached response from re-transmitting over the wire. I can't tell you exactly what cache-control headers to set for this but I know that express on nodejs does this be default.

I would not recommend saving to local storage, maybe cookies. More info here: https://auth0.com/docs/security/store-tokens. Hold in memory and write to cookie before app closes. User permissions on the front aren't real though, users can change JavaScript as they wish. Authentication for APIs are best done using JSON web tokens and permissions checked for each API call.

Once again the hashing stuff is taken care of by the HTTP protocol. I would recommend trying to get the Etag to work properly and only resorting to a custom hashing based cache-control strategy if you can't make it work. Keep in mind though this only eliminates data transfer costs, it does not get rid of the cost of computation on the backend as the backend has to still retrieve the data and hash it to check for changes.

What is more important then securing a privileged page is securing the data they can retrieve and manipulate. 

For instance, if someone manages to hack around the Route Guard and access your Admin page. When that page attempts to retrieve data from your server, that request should fail. Thus rending the Admin page unusable. In addition, if they hack around route guards and manage to access a 'User Edit' screen with their own data (because they have access to their own data right?)

AbstractLogic,"You are missing the concept of asynchronous programming. I recommend studying that.

Basically here is what is happning.

1. function_A() calls function_B()
2. function_B() calls function_P()
   
   Because function_P() is asynchronous (ie a promise) function_B() will continue executing and move to the next step. In your case, the next step is to return to function_A(). 
3. Now that function_A() has been given control it too will continue executing. Since function_B() has returned clean, ie no error, function_A will complete successfully.
4. While all of that is happening... function_P() is doing it's own work in parallel. At some point in the future function_P() throws an exception.
5. function_P(), a promise, performs a *callback* to the error handler you used.

      (exception) => { throw new Error(""error""); }
6. However, function_A() and function_B() no longer exist, they have already completed! So the throw new Error(""error"") goes off into unknown! (someone might know where it goes, I have no idea).

Some deeper insights:

What you may not see here is that (exception) => {throw new Error(""error"");} is actually method, lets call it function_E(). It is a method written in *expression* syntax. You are under the impression that function_P() is returning control to function_B(). But that is not the case. Really function_P() is calling function_E() or as you have it (exception) => { throw new Error(""error""); }.

AbstractLogic,"Thanks for the awesome writeup! Some of the best stuff I've seen on this sub. Here is my take away!

> When using ngFor to loop over an array in templates, use it with a trackBy function which will return an unique identifier for each item.

Use this when you expect the array to change, otherwise it's unnecessary. 

> When declaring variables, use const when the value is not going to be reassigned.

Install a real-time linter and configure this as a lint rule.

> use pipeable operators with rxjs

RxJs has a a ts-lint package that can help enforce these rules.

> Lazy load

I hate their lazy load syntax! It is super ugly. Like, do I really need to pass a string which is the filepath? Can't this be a compile thing if I import a module and use the type?

> Avoid having subscriptions inside subscriptions

This is something we used to do and started cleaning up. It has made our code much more readable.

> Avoid logic in templates. Having logic in the component means that it is not possible to unit test it and therefore it is more prone to bugs when changing template code.

Ummm, I agree. BUT you can definitely unit test the logic is in a template.

> Strings should be safe

>	The tradeoff that Redux offers is to add indirection to decouple “what happened” from “how things change”.

What that means is that you don’t want only to avoid duplicating state and have a single source of truth for your application but you also want to track, monitor, and decouple *how* your state changes throught the lifetime of the application.
Of course to accomplish this feat Redux requires indirection and some boilerplate [that can be cut easily](https://redux.js.org/recipes/reducingboilerplate)

For further motivation regarding Redux existence you can read [here](https://redux.js.org/introduction/motivation)

It’s like introducing complex patterns like CQRS or Event Sourcing to an application, you might not need it immediately and that’s totally fine. But if your application increases in complexity you might want to seek some patterns to improve the understanding of how your application works and how thigs change.

Of course Angular relies heavily on observables that’s why packages like @ngrx/store and @angular-redux exist.

,"Have you tried having a `BehaviorSubject` in your service and subscribing to that in the component and updating the local data source. As in:

The service has

    private data$ = new BehaviorSubject<datatype[]>(null);

    public observeData = () => return data$.asObservable();

    public filterByDate(date) {
      return this.http.get(/* request */).pipe(tap(filteredData => data$.next(filteredData)));
    }

The componenent does

    this.dataService.observeData().subscribe(data => this.dataSource = data);`

The header does

    this.dataService.filterByDate(date).subscribe(/* Use the data here if you want, 
    but header doesn't need to use it */);



This way any component can observe changes to the dataset caused by the filter in your header and you will have a 'global' source of truth to subscribe to. It's the same concept as store management solutions, but much simpler and tailored to your use case.

You can also use the onPush change detection strategy if every update to your data source is emitted as opposed to modified in place.

Edit: More Advanced but you can do an in place filter into API call.

    public filterByDate(date) {
      return of(this.currentData.filter(el => el.date === date)).pipe(
        tap(filteredData => data$.next(filteredData)),
        switchMap(_ => this.http.get(/* request */)),
        tap(filteredData => data$.next(filteredData)),
      );
    }

Keep in mind, this will emit twice, once for the locally filtered data set and again when the API returns more filtered data. This will provide a much better user experience to the user.
",1538558497.0
,Why do you want it to be called more than once or once for that matter? From what I am seeing your problem is that the action gets dispatched to the store before all API calls are complete. Is that what you want to fix? Dispatch action once after ALL the data is loaded?,1538512840.0
,"    output = [];

    ).subscribe(match => output.push(match), /* err handler */, 
        () =>  new GetMatchAnalysisLoadedAction({ data: output }).dispatch());

Your service methods should perform the filtering internally as you are already passing the match id to them. Also you can use `concatMap` instead of `mergeMap` if you want to fire the API requests in order and receive an in order reply.

`zip` is similar to `forkJoin` except it emits all values instead of the last. Serves the same purpose for your use case. `map` combines the result from the 2 additional API calls into a single match object. We collect all the matches to output array on `next()` and dispatch on `complete()`

EDIT: `from` instead of `of`",1538514464.0
tme321,"Don't do an initial `subscription`:

Except the article specifically mentions that the subscribe model can be used with OnPush, provided you know what you're doing, so this verdict makes no sense.

Additionally, both the disadvantages listed for the subscription model are literally, ""You have to know what you're doing,"" which is the case everywhere. Meanwhile based on the article itself the async pipe has tangible downsides based on what you're doing. Nothing in the article supports the final verdict of, ""Use the async pipe as much as possible,"" because both of the negatives for the subscribe model are avoided when you know what you're doing while not all of the async pipe downsides have the same avoid-ability.

I'm not saying one method is better than the other, I haven't worked with the async pipe much myself to say one way or the other, but I think there's an overall issue in the industry where we embrace, ""Do everything for me,"" models and techniques way too frequently. I've always been of the frame of mind that you can't make truly great applications unless you know what the frameworks you implement are doing, and things like the async pipe seem to be built specifically so you don't have to.

,"You could have multiple shared modules that group anything that gets reused by other FeatureModules. 

I'm not sure why you say unused code because if is imported in a SharedModule it must be being used somewhere else. Just because all of it doesn't get used in one FeatureModule doesn't make it unused code.

Tree shaking is a complimentary feature, it is not a substitute for developer managed imports. Tree shaking is an undecidable problem, just like garbage collection. At any point in given time, a computer cannot decide whether an import is needed or not. Just like a garbage collector cannot tell exactly whether an object should be collected or not. It can only make a best approximation based on whether a reference is held.

Here is another example of an untree shakeable situation: Make Ajax request. Response contains callback. Callback is present in a module that has never been referenced directly in code. Therefore the shaker cannot shake an imported module due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript.

As for the answer to your question: Directly import the pipe. If you need to re-use that pipe elsewhere then create another shared module with just the pipe.

We mostly have the query/mutation in the component ts file itself as a `const` just above the decorator. As most of those queries are not needed elsewhere. I imagine only writing a service when you need to reuse them.

We therefore inject apollo itself and just do `this.apollo.watchQuery<GetAllAutoCompleteHashtag>({query: getAllAutoCompleteHashtag}).[...]`.

We strive for simplicity and don't over abstract from the start. If this query would be needed elsewhere we would just refactor instead.

AbstractLogic,"Here is an example of component inheritance I have used and it seems like the right use case.

We have two different types of accounts. Each account goes through a similar 'sign up' workflow. Except, Account A requires a few extra fields and text on the signup form.

Since 95% of the workflow is identical we chose to use inheritance for this. We have a Base Account Creation Component and we extend it with AccountCreationA and AccountCreationB.

Now, you might be thinking ""Why not just have BaseAccountCreation"" with structural attributes?

    <input >FirstName </input>
    <app-account-A-creation *ngIf=""type == AccountA >
    <app-account-B-creation *ngIf=""type == AccountB >
    <input> Address </input>

The answer, is that the extra fields and text are distributed throughout the form and we never know if more fields/text will be added / removed based on account type. We certainly could have done it with Structural Directives (*ngIf) all over the form but it quickly becomes very ugly code to maintain.

ErnestPlethora,"I have been looking for a good argument to use a state management library, and I gotta say, the reasons in this article are weak.

I encourage people to quibble, but here is my retort.

**MAIN POINTS:**

**1) Model your application state**

As /u/drdrero said, you can have an application model in a service you inject into whatever component needs it.

**2) Derive computed values from it**

You can use [getters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) inside your models in TypeScript, which acts just like computed values.

**3) Monitor it for changes**

You do not need this, per 1.  The changes to the shared app model propogate through from one component to another.  A data bound value in one component will automatically reflect changes made to the value data bound in another.


**SECONDARY POINTS:**

**4) handling normalized data (redundant models can be avoided)**

I think this is just architecture (?).  Or I don't get this problem.


**5) immutability**

Um... const?


**6) organized state transition**

I don't know what that means.  If it means the state is all in one place, then the service model achieves that.


**7) time travel**

This is the only valid one.  It is the 'state machine' idea.  Too bad it is almost never used.  You never hear Redux people talking about actually using this feature.",1537893525.0
mattstrom,"Am I understanding you correctly in that you want to dispatch an action and then immediately read the values that it changed out of the store? If that's the case, then it is bad practice to do this.

First of all, presumably you have some handler, like a click handler, that triggers the `CreateTodo` action to be dispatched. With the way that you've written it, you are creating multiple subscriptions without unsubscribing from them. That will cause memory leaks. You should at least add a `take(1)` to the pipe to unsubscribe automatically.

(I'm going to assume that we have the `take(1)` in there because otherwise there's some gotchas.)

Secondly Redux, NgRx, and the like embrace some of the principles of CQRS, or command-query responsibility separation. Actions (commands) are meant to be separated from selectors (queries). An application should not have any knowledge of the relationship between the two. It should only know that it can issue commands and that it should react to state changes.

Your scenario is a trivial one, but suppose that creating a todo involved an asynchronous call to a backend server. Now your example is no longer valid because the code assumed that it could issue a command and the results of that command were immediately available. For more complex interactions, it's easy to introduce race conditions.

There are some rare cases with NgRx where it's appropriate to use the synchronous nature of selectors to pluck a value off of the store. But, like the GitHub issue described, it should assumed that you working off of a snapshot in time that will no longer change state. And it would probably never be preceded immediately with a dispatch. Usually it's more appropriate to use `combineLatest()` or `withLatestFrom()` for this purpose.",1537837187.0

xSilentium,"Well that depends on how heavily the designs differ.

Usually simply loading different CSS files suffices. You can also achieve structural changes by using flex box order or grid areas.",1537515176.0
mattstrom,"One thing that I have done in the past was to use [Webpack DLLs](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/dll-plugin/) to split out styles into separate dynamically linked libraries. (Admittedly this is a very complex solution.)

I first separated out what I called *structural CSS* and *cosmetic CSS* where the cosmetic CSS was bundled in the DLL and the structural CSS stayed with the main app. Components looked something like this:

    @Component({
      selector: 'my-component',
      templateUrl: './my.component.html',
      styles: [
        require('./my.component.scss'), // Structural CSS
        customizedStyle(STYLES.MyComponent) // Cosmetic CSS
      ]
    })
    export class MyComponent {}

I then had a special function name `customizedStyles()` that looked like this:

    import { Type } from '@angular/core';
    import mapping from './mapping';
    
    export function customizedStyle(component: string|symbol|Type<any>): string {
      return (process.env.USE_CUSTOMIZATIONS)
        ? mapping.get(component)
        : '';
    }

Then there was a mapping file. These 2 files weren't entirely necessary, but they helped with components that shared a stylesheet and with disabling customizations with a flag for unit testing:

    import { Type } from '@angular/core';
    import { SHARED_STYLES, STYLES } from '../../di/types';
    
    const mapping = new Map<string|symbol|Type<any>, string>();
    
    mapping.set(STYLES.MyComponent, require('customization/styles/components/my/my.component.scss'));

And then there were 2 Webpack configurations, one for the main app and one for building DLLs.

    // webpack.main.js
    plugins: [
      new webpack.DllReferencePlugin({
        context: helpers.root('src'),
        scope: 'customization',
        manifest: require('../dlls/customizations-manifest.json')
      })
    ]

    // webpack.dlls.js (run multiple times for each customer)
    plugins: [
      new webpack.DllPlugin({
        path: helpers.root('dlls', '[name]-manifest.json'),
        name: '[name]',
        context: helpers.root('dlls-src')
      })
    ]

In the _dlls-src_ directory I would create stylesheets for cosmetic styles that correspond to the paths listed in the mapping file. Finally I would build a customized DLL for each customer and then in their HTML page, I would include one extra `<script>` tag that pointed to their specific DLL.",1537518919.0

robjackstewart,"You can protect routes with guards for example I have written a 'LoggedInGuard' which means that you must be logged in to access the route, and a 'RoleGuard' which ensures that you have to be of a specific role type to enter that route also. Both pieces of information depend on a JWT so if the token exists and is not expired then they are logged in and it will continue a claim which states their role. When setting out your routing, you simply add the guards under the 'canActivate' property and the. To specify the accepted roles, you simply add an object under the 'data' property which contains a list of strings that are allowed roles which are added to the JWT upon authentication. So theoretically, in your situation, you could produce a JWT when the user logs in and add the features they can access as a claim, your application then populates these in a 'LoggedInUser' service as a series of behaviour subjects to avoid having to check the token in storage every single time. Then create a 'PayForFeature' guard which checks that the feature they are accessing has been payed for. Does that help at all?",1537479429.0

zmasta94,"Code placed in a service doesn’t have to be generic or reuseable. It can be used just once, and still belong in a service. 

There is no right or wrong answer, but you should try to establish some coding patterns for symmetry. Decide what YOU want component logic to do, what you want service logic to do etc. 

The pattern I usually take is that a component/controller class deals with the display logic. It does any logic related to how data is displayed. It should be simple and easy to read and follow. And service methods should have verbose names so that I can read within a component what each service call does without having to look at the code of the service. This will eventually force you to follow the SRP principle which in my opinion is another pattern you should try to do. 

I don’t think there’s an issue with having hundreds of services as long as you are not over-abstracting. Each ‘thing’ (component, directive, service, pipe) should do one/some-thing and do it well. ",1537476978.0

BUT:

You should create a small CRUD test case. Don't forget to take a deep look at selectors / queries - especially combining. Then start with Akita (entities) as it might be the fastest to get you up and running, then NGXS which is also easy to learn and use, last NGRX as it requires most time learning. For NGRX keep in mind that there're pretty great schematics to help you coding out your stuff in production. So, while there is a lot of boilerplate (yes, true boilerplate :-)) you don't have to type it all out. Once you got a structure of your app you can be very productive with NGRX as well. NGRX has a traditional functional Redux style, which some love. I found for myself that I prefer the style of NGXS (and Akita), but you really shoud find out yourself.

tme321,">According to this article NgRx: tips & tricks logic in reducers should be omitted. 

This is terrible advice.  The logic inside a reducer should be ""pure"" meaning it is completely derived from the parameters it is passed: the previous state and the action w/ a payload if one was attached.  But to say that reducers should have no logic is the exact opposite of the point of the redux pattern.

Dispatching multiple actions in order to do a single process is also incorrect though as Mike Ryan stated.

As you said, you can keep an older SelectTabs action around tied to the explicit user selecting tabs.

For closing tabs though I would do the logic in the reducer.  I made this example which I will post at the bottom but I actually came up with another idea while writing it.  The code at the bottom is mostly fine, I didn't bother fine tuning it or really doing much of anything other than writing out the first thing that came to mind but it should give you an idea of how I would initially approach the problem.

But what I realized while writing that is I think it would be better to keep a list of each tab the user opens, clicks on, navigates too, whatever.  So assuming you save the tabs as an id inside this list after a user has been using the application for a while you might end up with something like

    [0,3,1,0,1,0,3,2,6,1,0,1,0,2,5]

Each time they select a tab just append the id to this growing list.

Then what you can do is when you are closing a bunch of tabs you can filter the tabs to be closed from that list of tabs visited and then just take the last item from the list.  That is the last tab the user clicked on that wasn't just closed.  So you can take them back to their last valid view by just setting the selected tab to the last item inside the filtered list.

So after thinking about it that's probably how I would handle a tabs closing.  But if you don't want to do something like that here's the code of how I would do the logic in the reducer.  This reducer is still pure, it only operates on data passed as parameters.  The logic itself could probably be optimized in some way but the basic idea should be similar.


    export interface Tabs {
      tabs: Tab[];
      selectedTabId: number
    }
    
    export interface Tab {
      id: number;
      isOpen: boolean;
    }
    
    export class CloseTabAction {
      type = 'CloseTabs';
      constructor(public payload:{ tabsToClose: Tab[]}) {}
    }
    
    function reducer(state: Tabs,action) {
      switch(action.type) {
        case 'CloseTabs': {
          const selectedId: number = state.selectedTabId;
          const tabsToClose: Tab[] = action.payload.tabsToClose;
          let nextOpenTab: Tab;
    
          //if the currently selected tab is inside the list 
          // of tabs to close find the next tab that isn't already
          // closed and isn't about to be closed.
          if(tabsToClose.map(tab=>tab.id).includes(selectedId)) {
    
            //filter out already closed tabs
            const openTabs = state.tabs.filter(tab=>!tab.isOpen);
    
            // find the index inside the filtered list of the selected tab
            const selectedTabIndex = openTabs.map(tab=>tab.id).indexOf(selectedId);
            
            // find the next tab that isn't going to be closed, this
            // only looks forward so you might have to do some fancier
            // logic to also look backwards.
            for(let tab of state.tabs.slice(selectedTabIndex)) {
              if(!tabsToClose.includes(tab)) {
                nextOpenTab = tab;
                break;
              }
            }

Oddisey,"I used Todd Mottos tut and expanded on it heavily.

I am actually in the midst of it right now. I’ve spend the last few weeks putting it together. One of the pain points was not making it colossal. It’s easy to do, but impossible to maintain, because various logic needed to take place in between a sections of the form.

To get around that, I implemented the functionality for Headless Dynamic Forms. To do this I pass in a Form Group initialized in the “host component” to the Dynamic Form Component and tell it to bind all of its children to that form. Instead of having the Dynamic Form component generate its own.

This allows me to create pieces of a form and scatter them around the page, as log as that page has a <form [formGroup]=“form”></form> wrapping around all of the pieces. Or if I please, just put them all together and have it be a traditional form.

I use a service to pass events down to each form element component from the host component. And have each form element component use bubbling events to trigger form events in the host component. This allows me to control everything i want to.

I’m actually just finishing up documentation and VS Code code snippets for the devs on my team so it’s more easily useable.

zmasta94,"To answer one of your questions: https://www.technouz.com/4725/disable-angular-reactiveform-input-based-selection/

I just finished building a complex five-page form that contains approx 20 individual components. Many of the inputs across pages are affected by values input elsewhere. There input fields, custom validators, forms with the form, multi select checkboxes, radio button selects with the option to select 'other' and enter a custom value, form values set by the users authentication token etc etc

My conclusion: ReactiveForms are a big step forward from template driven forms, but still very rough on the edges for super complex forms where they have the power to shine. I love how many things can be controlled and manipulated programmatically which leaves the HTML templates to focus on how things are displayed. Things like on-blur and on-change can be done in the controller by subscribing to the FormControls. 

But things like using NgRx or breaking the form in to SRP and testable components is still tough. ",1536869833.0
DrFriendless,"Yes I did, but it was for work so I can't share the code. Yes, it did get a bit messy, especially as I handled the case where if you filled in a value for a field, which then became hidden, I kept that value and stuck it back in if the field later became visible again.

Start with a set of fields which are always visible, and a set of fields which may be visible. Any field may have a rule saying ""if my value is like this, show this other field"". 

To decide what fields are visible, start with those that are visible. Examine their values and apply their rules. If more fields become visible, they are either blank or they have a stored value. Then apply the rules again to see if more fields become visible. Keep doing this until no more fields become visible.

I didn't have to address ordering problems, as our fields have predefined orders, so I just ordered them how I was told to. This avoided the problem that a field is visible because of rules about two or more other fields, as the natural inclination would be to put it after the field that caused it to become visible.

To define the rules, I used JSON and regexp for the matching. That means our customer service people have to write regexps, but generally they are trivial regexps anyway.",1536888488.0

Nfurr22,I would look into using css variables instead of trying to re compile sass at runtime. With css variables you can provide a value at build and then change its value based on the response from the server,1536766476.0
,"Yep this is possible, you need to load css instead of scss on the fly as the browser can't parse scss. You would achieve this by starting a blank scss file. Then you would import the angular material theming sass files and initialise the theme, do your customisation and compile it to css. You can also use a pre-built css such as purple-green.css found in the npm package. 

Run a find and replace on the primary, accent and text colors to replace them with css variables. Like so, `background: var(--primary-color)` Then set the default values at the root level.

    :root {
      --primary-color: #whatever;
      --accent-color: #whatever;
      --text-color: #whatever;
    }

In your client app, do:

    document.body.style.setProperty('--primary-color',""#whatever"")
    document.body.style.setProperty('--accent-color',""#whatever"")
    document.body.style.setProperty('--text-color',""#whatever"")

And you can simply unset them to revert to the default colors defined in root.

You can also set these variables per component for sub-themeing by injecting an `elementRef` into your component, https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/handout/advanced-components/elementref.html

    this.elementRef.nativeElement.style.setProperty('--text-color',""#whatever"")

You can also use angular binding but the custom colours will have to be sanitized first, with your own logic.

mattstrom,"To load custom CSS on-the-fly, you will not be able to use AOT compilation, which will compile styles ahead of time before transmission to the client. You will instead need to include Angular's JIT compiler with your application. Using the JIT compiler for on-the-fly styling can still be a bit challenging because styles are compiled at the time that components are registered, not when components are instantiated. That can be attributed to the fact the styles are defined in the `@Component` decorator rather than within the class.

Angular Material's own site is able to change themes dynamically; however, I imagine these have to be predefined themes. It does appear that they are not using Angular's shadow DOM emulation (i.e. `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated`) but rather `ViewEncapsulation.None`, so you can probably get away with simply loading styles via a `<link>` or `<style>` tag rather than through Angular. Using SCSS in the browser is out of the question because currently the Sass compiler use C bindings and therefore cannot run as straight JS code. You could potentially send a request to the backend that would run the Sass compiler and then send back the generated theme file. From here, you could simply insert a new `<style>` tag with the generated CSS for the theme.

tme321,"I've never used it before but a quick Google search turned up [this cms for Angular](https://buttercms.com/angular-cms/).  That might be worth investigating since it sounds like it can handle a lot of what you are looking for.

If you are intent on rolling your own solution then what I would do is come up with a system where you can specify a binding back to a config.  This mapping might be done in the component itself or it might be done in a service, I would have to experiment to figure out what would work best.

But for #1 the basic idea is somehow associate a binding value like the text in the heading with an entry in a config file.  Then read the config file and do a lookup on the association and set the retrevied value to the binding.

That idea could be taken as far as you want.  Instead of a simple config file you could store the associations inside a database.  You could create a page inside the app or a completely separate app that gives you a nice interface to change this config.  You could even make the config changes and have them display in real time what the changes will look like in a preview.  Basically as fancy as you want to get and as much time as you are willing to spend.

For #2 it's a bit more complicated and depends heavily on the level of customization.  I can say immediately that I wouldn't use inheritance of components.  If all you need to do is change the columns inside a data table then create a data table that is model driven instead of template driven for the columns.  I've done this where the table, filters, and a few associated widgets were all model driven so that the same set of components could be reused by simply setting them to use a different model.

If you need more dynamic layouts than that I would go with some sort of dynamic components layout where again the layout would be model driven.  Similar to #1 the layout itself could be described in data that can be serialized so that you can store it on a server as a json config (or similar) and just read the right config to construct the view.

And much like #1 it could be as simple or complex as you want.  It just depends on how much development effort you are willing to put into it.

So my advice would be to first at least check out that link.  They looked to have a free trial so at least you can take it for a quick spin and see if it fulfills your needs.  If it doesn't or you aren't interested in paying for it then you could move on and start designing something as I have described above.",1536600752.0

(Also, I experienced a problem with NgXS, it runs http calls made from within actions outside of zone. A plugin that displays a loading bar automatically didn't work as expected, and an option to turn off the run-outside-zone feature was rejected because performance).

I have a question (not directly related to a specific state management system). Let me explain via example :

Let's say we have a gaming site that displays players.

* page 1 lists players under 20 years old
* page 2 lists players 20+ years old
* page 3 lists players currently active (logged in within last 30 days)


When someone visits the site :

* page 1 loads url ""/players/young"" and 10 players loaded into memory
* page 2 loads url ""/players/old"" and 20 players are added to memory

So far we have 30 players in memory. Now page 3 is clicked.

* page 3 loads url ""/players/active"" and all active players are added to memory

My question is; at the time page 3 is clicked, I can't know if all active players are already in memory or not. I end up making an http call anyway.

In this scenario a state management system works only if all players (= entire database table) are loaded into memory from backend at first view or at startup. (What if there are thousands of players ?)

I ended up caching the API urls in a Set<string> inside a data service (as suggested by Akita anyway) and when a user re-visits a page he has visited before I check the ""Set"" for a specific url and skip the http call if present. (The url is removed from the Set when a ""refresh list"" button is clicked)

The point is, the data to be displayed on each page depends on the backend url (if a specific url is already loaded or not) rather than an rxjs filter. Am I missing here something ? What would be a better solution to this ?

First you need to split all your configuration options into two sets: with limited set of values and with unlimited set of values. Limited set of values is for example font size - a user can only select Small, Medium and Large for example. Unlimited example is colour - there are millions of RGB colours.

For limited options you apply a CSS class to your angular app tag and create global styles according to these classes. For example:

    app-root.font-size-medium p { font-size: 16px; }
    app-root.font-size-small p { font-size: 12px; }

This way you can predefine all possible overrides quite easily.

For unlimited options you should split them into a small set of logical groups, for example three groups: primary, secondary and warning colours. Then you should put group related classes on all related customisable html tags, like p.primary-color. Then in runtime you can load configuration and generate a bunch of corresponding classes.

heywinstonillraceya,Set up your global variables in the environments.prod file and replace accordingly. Run ng build —prod. Create an S3 bucket on AWS Console.

To answer your question, no angular flex-layout is not required to make your app responsive. But it's probably the best thing you can use, I'm my opinion.

You can use flexbox, which is a plain html+css feature for making webpages responsive. Basically, instead of a grid system like bootstrap and others, it's a column/row based, grow/shrink type deal. Here's a link explaining what it is: https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/

Angular Flex Layout took flexbox and made it more Angular-y by allowing you to use it as directives. The documentation and examples are quite poor, but once I played around with it for a while i got to know it, and now I find it quite easy to make my apps responsive.
https://tburleson-layouts-demos.firebaseapp.com/#/responsive

AbstractLogic,"I am very sorry you have had such troubles my friend. I have been working on a project with this exact setup for little over a year. My biggest advice is to go slowly. Based on the errors and some of your comments it seams you are trying to do to much without learning what each step in the process does or means.

Let me help with your immediate errors. But I will include some more advice below.

First and formost. It appears you are having a lot of problems with packages. Did you generate your Angular website using the Angular CLI (aka ng new)?

* npm WARN @angular/http@6.0.2
* npm WARN @angular/http@6.0.2

These both indicate that you have a bad package.json file. The recomendation of using Angular CLI to generate the website should help here.

* npm WARN bootstrap@4.1.3

Did you install bootstrap via the command line 'npm install bootstrap'? If so it should add any other requirments automatically to the package.json including the 'jquery' one. If this did not happen what version of NPM/Node are you using ? ""npm -v"" and ""node -v"" will tell you.

* npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY:

This can be ignored if you are on windows it's not a required package.


 * Error Build:Type 'Observable<boolean>' is not assignable to type 'Observable<UserRegistration>'.

Just like in C#, you can't assign two different types. For instance int myInt = ""hello world""; would throw an error at compile time in dotnet. At the moment this seems like the least of your worries. 

* Cannot find module '@angular-devkit/schematics'

You have not added the Schematics package to your project.json or you have not run npm install to pull the package down.


I have several websites/rest API's built with Angular and dotnet core. It has been a lot of work to manage upgrades from Angular 2 -> 6 and dotnet core 1 -> 2. They both seem like a lot of churn but they both seem to have settled down too. Angular's ng-update command is super nice. That being said I'm not sure why you are trying to upgrade a project you just started. You should have started the project outright with Angular 6.

Maybe what you really need help with is setting up a development envionrment. That is also something I have done a writeup on for our team. My process is smooth and battle tested. IF you would like an explenation of this I may be able to help.

What IDE are you using for Angular? We love VS Code here because we are a microsoft first shop.

ericpap,"Hi. I fully understand you, believe me.

I have been working for a year in a similar project. Angular it's hard to learn, there's no doubt about it.

Let me give you some advices:

1. Divide your project in diferent parts, and chose wich technology to use on each one.
2. To conmunicate the differents part use simple plain objects.
3. At the begginning, don't start your angular project from scratch. I recomend you to get a base project similar to yours and work on that.

In my case, I follow the next path: I divide my project in Backend (.NET Core Web API on C# running inside docker container and hosted on Azure) and frontend (Angular proyect that consume that API). Communications between parts is made via JSON plain objects. Next I choose a library (Angular native and open source) that give all the controls and base components I need. In my case was PrimeNG. I then buy a PrimeNG template that was similar to what i want to accomplish and start working from there.

I hope this helps you. Don't give up",1536330799.0

If so you can convert a promise to an observable with `fromPromise`.

A `Subject` is the basic input end of an observable stream.  If you wanted to you could create a `Subject<Observable<User>>` and then pipe that through a `flatMap` operator to extract the `User` from the inner `fromPromise` that you emit from the `Subject`.  

You can look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/7a774y/resolving_http_requests_to_templates_by_example/) and specifically at the pipeline example in it for what I'm talking about in more detail.

tme321,"I think you're going to have to provide more context.  Because generally a ViewChild should work but I can't say why isn't working for you without seeing what you were trying.

I'm guessing, throw darts blindly, that the ngIf controlling the div is set by the same stream that fetches the data?  If so the basic issue is that you get the data and that's supposed to signify to the div to exist but since you are trying to feed the data to it immediately you haven't given angular a chance to run a cycle and update the dom based on the new state of the binding.

A better approach might be to move the code that controls the map into a directive.  Create a directice and attach it to the div.  Then inject ElementRef into that directive.  Get the data as normal in the parent component, pass it as normal down an @Input binding to the directive, and then inside the directive's ngOnInit callback read the data passed to it and actually initialize the map.  When you initialize it I'm assuming you pass it an element, so that's why you inject ElementRef then you pass off ElementRef.nativeElement to the map code for the element it wants.

Then the directive can control the divs lifecycle and therefore know when it's safe to create the map but the parent component can still be responsible both for getting the data and toggling whether this div exists.",1535917200.0

I don't know if there is an Angular 1.6 way of doing what you need but, when it comes to Observables you don't have to split the data itself into smaller structures and then create observables from it. You can create the observable from the structure as is and then use the operators to filter/map/change the notifications/updates from it in a way that your components needs them.

Just as an example, for the component that needs only the static data, you can map the initial update (whole structure) to match only the static part and then apply the *distinctUntilChanged* operator. This way the component wont be updated about the changes it does not care about.

Zessiss,"Maybe it's not best way to handle, but I can share my experience:

Some context: there are some entities (20+ types) with CRUD available, also there are templates available (user can create template which is not validated and later create new entity from template and fill missing fields), also there are cases where entity can be 'pre-filled' based on some conditions (for example : user clicks on some button like 'withdraw money from deposit' and application navigates to document creation with some pre-filled fields, like 'from account', etc..)

At first we used single components for all CRUD with disabled/enabled fields but it became a mess and it was hard to maintain/add new features (maybe it's my fault btw :) )

So I came with that solution:

there are routes like that: 

/document/entity\_1/create   

/document/entity\_1/copy/:id

/document/entity\_1/edit/:id

and there are template routes:

/template/entity\_1/create

/template/entity\_1/copy/:id

/template/entity\_1/edit/:id

First of all wer have 'forms' components like Entity1EditFields and Entity1ViewFields (we have different UI for edit/view pages : inputs on edit and simple text on view) which are responsible for user interaction (filling data mostly)

There are 'smart' components like Entity1CreateComponent, Entity1ViewComponent, Entity1TemplateCreateComponent which are responsible for getting data from API (there are pages which require 10+ API requests before showing page, also \*Create components support query parameters for custom 'pre-fill' like /create?source=deposit\_withdraw&account=1234...)

Speaking in NgModules: there are Entity1Module, Entity1TemplateModule and both of them import Entity1SharedModule

All smart components simply pass data/form via inputs to form components.

Some 'form' components also have 'action' input in case we need to do something different on create/copy/edit pages

Maybe it sounds overcomplicated but in my case it works (1+ year in production) and is pretty straightforward: all entities use same 'architecture': user interaction grouped in single 'form' component, data loading done and in 'smart' components

* A technique that I've used before is to use route guards or resolvers to trap a navigation, do some processing, cancel the current navigation, and then redirect to a new route, perhaps with a parameter added on.
* Angular also supports [secondary routes](https://angular.io/guide/router#secondary-routes) along with named router outlets to allow you have non-nested router outlets. This allows you to control, say, 2 blocks side-by-side independently with routes. Example:

-- Old and wrong answer below

I am very unfamiliar with the structure. However, what does webSocket do? Aren't you supposed to create the instance with new?

Example code I have seen is here:
```
        const { WebSocketSubject } = rxjs.webSocket;
        const socket$ = new WebSocketSubject('ws://localhost:8080');
        socket$.subscribe(
                (data) => console.log(data),
                (err) => console.error(err),
                () => console.warn('Completed!')
            );
        socket$.next({
            event: 'events',
            data: 'test',
        });
        console.log('here')

- app.module.ts

- admin/admin.module.ts
- blog/blog.module.ts

Obviously you would choose modules appropriate to your application, but there are essentially two main kinds of modules you might create. The first is a common or shared module which contains components and directives that are used across many different parts of your application, so perhaps something like a navigation bar component.

The other would be feature modules, so in the example above that would be admin and blog modules. These would often be pages in your application, so in this app I have an admin page and a blog page. These modules contain the components and directives specifically for these pages only. But most importantly is as these are separate modules we can now lazy load them, so in other words, we do not need to load the admin page when someone first arrives on your website. This will shrink your bundle size and improve page load times. We then load the admin page only when a user navigates to it. There are many resources online explaining how to do this which should be easy to find.

Creating these modules is easy with the cli and can be done simply by running

ng generate module shared

Then to create a shared component you could do something like:

ng generate module shared/navigation-bar

The same applies to any feature module you create.

lehoiven,"Lots of stuff.  Both make SPAs with the same sort of capabilities.  Angular is more of a complete, pre-packaged framework system, whereas React is an ecosystem of libraries you choose from and wire up.

The biggest difference, IMHO, is that Angular uses HTML templates with a system of attributes (directives) you put in the HTML tags to tell the framework how to connect to the UI for data binding, and doing loops for lists, and magic stuff like that.  React has you write HTML-like code called JSX inside the JavaScript, and that is processed through a virtual DOM which updates the UI.  

Angular does data binding in a built in way using directives that automatically handle updating the UI when you directly alter the model, and each component has its own model.  React has an application state and a whole bunch of choices for how you can deal with updating it, some of which are quite fancy, and border on a state machine.

The overall architecture of an Angular app is basically a bunch of components in an app module.  There are also things called services you can pass around the whole app.  These modules, components, and services are part of the framework, and have a defined syntax and way they can interact.  It uses imports to get at reusable code.  It also uses a concept called dependency injection to get the reusable stuff inside the encapsulated components.

Angular 2 comes with its own existing Command Line Interface, and all the code for the app written in TypeScript.  React is written basically in ECMAScript 6 and uses the existing build tool ecosystem, with the freedom to chose lots of specifics.

Again, IMHO, the architecture of modules, components, services, and dependency injection, is the hardest part about learning Angular.  You sort of face that learning curve right at the start, so you need some persistence.  I believe the difficulties are offset by not having to meddle around with a bunch of disparate libraries and deal with whole build tool world.  I also feel (opinion) that HTML templates with directives are cleaner conceptually than JSX.

I was surprised how much I came to like Angular 2 once I got through the challenging phase between 'Hello World' and full comprehension.  I usually hate being forced to subscribe to a predefined complex architecture, but I am starting to see the wisdom of Angular.  I have used React a little, and I thought it felt more complicated, especially when you try to do advanced stuff.

tme321,"The cli has great support for making libraries.  First make a new project like usual with `ng new`.  The app it produces will be your display case application.

Then in side there you can create the components and set up the package.json for the library and all that.

Then back inside the app created by `ng new` you can import your library as if it were in node_modules and create the showcase app.

I used to find it overly complex but looking back at it, I think it was a good choice to stick with Angular. I'm starting to see and experience why stuff in Angular is the way it is. It might feel overkill for small apps but when things get bigger...

synalx,"Hi, Alex (R) from the Angular team here!

I think the reason this is confusing you is that there's a missing piece of the puzzle you're not considering: injectors. An injector is the thing that actually creates instances of services and other types, and ""injects"" dependencies when doing so. Injectors are hierarchical - each injector has a parent injector, and if you ask it for a type that it doesn't know about, it'll try to get it from its parent.

Every Angular app has at least 3 injectors (and most have more). These are:

The platform injector (the top-level one). This holds services which are truly singletons on the page (e.g. the service which tracks the current page URL - there's only one of these).

The application injector, which is frequently called the ""root"" injector (even though it's a child of the platform injector). This holds most services for the application.

The top-level app component's injector. Each component instance gets its own injector. For the top-level component, it's a child of the application injector. For other components, their injectors are children of their parent components.

For complex apps there can be more injectors in the mix. For example, every layer of lazy loading in the router creates a new injector, which will be the parent of the lazily loaded component for that route. Each of these injectors (including the top-level application injector) is created from an NgModule.

Placing a provider in a component ensures the service is scoped to that component's injector - each instance of that component will get its own copy of the service, which will also be injectable into any sub-component instances.

Placing a provider in an _NgModule_, on the other hand, does not tell you where the service will be scoped. To know that, you need to know to which injector(s) include that NgModule. An injector includes the module if it's created from the module (via bootstrap or loadChildren) or if it's imported into the module from which the injector was created.

For example:

    @NgModule({providers: [Service]})
    export class ServiceModule {}

What's the scope of `Service`? It depends. If for example, the `ApplicationModule` imports `ServiceModule`:

    @NgModule({import: [ServiceModule, ...]})
    export class AppModule {}

then `Service` will be available from the application (root) injector. If some lazily loaded module imports it:

    @NgModule({import: [ServiceModule, RouterModule.forChild(...)]})
    export class LazyRouteModule {}

Then the lazily loaded route (and any children) will have access to an instance of `Service` from the lazily loaded injector.

_Both_ of these scenarios could be true - the `ServiceModule` could be imported into both injectors. In this case, most of the application would have access to one instance of `Service`, with the exception of the lazily loaded route which would get its own, independent instance of `Service`.

So you can't talk about the scope of a service without knowing to which injector the module providing it belongs.

In the community there is a convention to have a `forRoot()` method on modules which are intended to be included in the application injector. `RouterModule.forRoot()` for example includes providers which only really make sense at the top level, and set up the router enough for lazy loading to work.

With the latest Angular you can use ""tree-shakeable services"" and define a provider for a service independently of any module. In reality, you are telling Angular that it should consider your service to be a part of the root module.

    @Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
    export class Service {}

No module is needed here - if you try to inject `Service`, the root injector will create a single shared instance for your whole app.

Does this help?",1535153481.0

One issue was that System.import() had been replaced with just import() so I went and manually adjusted that but I'm not sure if that was necessarily the best move since editing node modules is sort of out of my league (good learning experience I guess).

Anyway is anyone familiar with these errors and knows of a proper fix or is this going to just require me to manually fix the modules or keep updating the npms until someone works out the issue.

mattstrom,"Can you expound on what pluggable means for your company?

I think your instincts are right about Angular being more than suitable for the task. I don't think you can beat Angular for pluggability. Dependency injection and the module system are awesome for this.

My company has a product built on Angular 4 that embeds into our client's website. The primary part of the app operates as a modal. However, we also have a couple of embeddable components that could be bootstrapped separately from the main app, defined as `entryComponents` in our root module. It was also designed with the ability to change modules based on the form factor; if the user was on mobile, then one module would load and similarly for desktop. It is even able to coexist with React apps on the website, as siblings though not as a child of the React app. (I haven't tried making a React app a subcomponent of an Angular app yet).

You could achieve a similar capability for a pluggable website with DI and lazy loaded routes. With Angular's secondary router outlets, you can fill multiple sections of the page independently but still use the router. We used this approach to coexist with our client's sites that used hash-based routing.

If you're going for a reusable, distributable component library, then web components is probably the ideal approach for you. The Angular Elements feature in Angular 6 is an exciting feature for doing just that (though it's still technically experimental). Elements allows you to develop components that can used in other frameworks. Angular will output components implemented with standard Web Components but that still use Angular under the hood for state and services.",1534543254.0
artaommahe,"Nothing in this case is about particular framework and can be done with any of the modern ones.

Rebuilding with new framework will be 'twice'+ expensive than rebuilding with same due to developers re-education and a lot of new design errors from the scratch due to lack of valid experience with new framework.

For such transition you need a lot of 'real' reasons that can prove that transition issues will be less expensive than further developing with new framework.

And no one cares about 'framework', your code just should solve problems and allow to solve new problems faster/cheaper/better (check 2 as usual :) ).

```
// auth/reducers/auth.reducer.ts

export interface State {
  loggedIn: boolean;

}

export const initialState: State = {
  loggedIn: false,
  ...
};

export function reducer(state = initialState, action: AuthActions): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case AuthActionTypes.LOGIN_SUCCESS:
      return { ...state, loggedIn: true };

    ...

    default:
      return state;
  }
}

export const getLoggedIn = (state: State) => state.loggedIn;
```

```
// auth/reducers/index.ts

import * as fromAuth from '@auth/reducers/auth.reducer';
import * as fromLoginPage from '@auth/reducers/login-page.reducer';

export interface State {
  main: fromAuth.State;
  loginPage: fromLoginPage.State;
}

export const reducers: ActionReducerMap<State> = {
  main: fromAuth.reducer,
  loginPage: fromLoginPage.reducer
};

export const selectAuthState = createFeatureSelector<State>('auth');

export const getAuthMainState = createSelector(selectAuthState, (state: State) => state.main);
export const getLoggedIn = createSelector(getAuthMainState, fromAuth.getLoggedIn);
```

because auth state is shared, needs to import AuthModule into AppModule, but only ngrx related things 

```
// auth.module.ts

...
import { reducers } from '@auth/reducers';
import { AuthRoutingModule } from '@auth/auth-routing.module';
import { AuthEffects } from '@auth/effects/auth.effects';
...

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreModule.forFeature('auth', reducers),
    EffectsModule.forFeature([AuthEffects])
  ],
  providers: []
})
export class AuthRootModule {}

@NgModule({
  imports: [AuthRootModule, AuthRoutingModule],
  declarations: [
    ...
    LoginPageComponent
  ]
})
export class AuthModule {
  static forRoot(): ModuleWithProviders {
    return {
      ngModule: AuthRootModule,
      providers: []

  }
}

``` 

```
// app.module.ts

  imports: [
    ...
    AuthModule.forRoot(),

  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

```
import { select, Store } from '@ngrx/store';

import * as fromAuth from '@auth/reducers';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'],
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  ...

tme321,"I don't use the standard forms so this is partly conjecture, but based off of how a lot of other parts of angular work my guess is that NgModel runs on similar principles to `onPush` change detection.  Maybe someone else can correct me if I'm wrong here and has another solution.

But quite simply, stop fighting against the best way to use Angular.  Start using Observables.  They solve the issues you are running into without resorting to any `ApplicationRef.tick()` or `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()` type stuff that you have to do manually.

Use Observables, as a side effect set your change detection strategy to `onPush` just because at that point it's free, and don't bother trying to mess with the change detector manually yourself.

It can be this simple, instead of 

    @Injectable() class DataService {
        data: Data;
        setData(newData: Data) {
            data = newData;
        }
    }

Just do

    @Injectable() class DataService {
        data$ = new BehaviorSubject<Data>(initialData);
        setData(newData: Data) {
            this.data$.next(newData);
        }
    }

Then you can set a member inside a component to data$ and use the async pipe to get the data onto the template:

    @Component({
        template: `
            <div> 
                {{data$ | async}}
            </div>
        `
    })
    class DataComponent {
        data$: Observable<Data>;

        constructor(private dServ: DataService) {}

        ngOnInit() {
            this.data$ = this.dServ.data$;
        }
    }

You have to localize the observable so that the template can access it, but otherwise that's all you really have to do.  You can also pass it around to other components like:

    template: `
        <ChildComponent [data]=""data$ | async""></ChildComponent>
    `

And since ChildComponent is receiving it from the async pipe you can just define the member normally there:

    @Component({
        template: `
            <div>{{data}}</div>
        `
    })
    class ChildComponent {
        @Input() data: Data;
    }

I've used Angular enough at this point that I am positive that just using observables is by far the easiest method.  You never have to touch the change detection stuff manually and you get the side benefit of automatically getting to use the faster change detection strategy; free performance improvement.

Personally, I think Angular should push observables far more than it does, instead of trying to pretend like you don't have to use them.  But it is what it is.  And the sooner you start using Observables and working with them the faster you'll start to understand them and see their benefits.  In the long run it really does simplify things.",1534120778.0

Danieliverant,"are you passing the object from the parent to the child by using ""@Input()""?if so, object properties will not get updated, only the object ref, and Angular will not know that some property have changed.what you can do, is to create new object by using the spread operator and inserting it to a new object, example:

    const newObject = { ...oldObject };

also, try using \*ngIf if the element should not be seen before the ""update"" happens.

Rxjs made it really easy.  Make the referrer page subscribe to the router's query parameters and also subscribe to client side data needed for the api to complete registration with the 3rd party and combine those observables.  Once they all have resolved I have all the data needed to fire a registration at my api, wait for the success return message, and then inform the user it succeeded and reroute to a different page.

Sure, you can use rxjs with any framework.  But angular's built in rxjs hooks for things like the router made it easier than having to set up all of that manually.

Also I created a whole data table, filters, query parameters, etc ball of ui that, similar to /u/alsvn 's description, worked based on injected services.

* TypeScript and Flow both work well with React. Most react based libraries have TypeScript definitions available, probably more so than Flow. Not React's fault your team doesn't want to use it :)
* I think most React developers are moving towards css-in-js options these days (at least the ones I talk to). Things like emotion and styled-components make it pretty easy imo.
* Redux certainly has it's issues, but plenty of solutions to replace it that reduce the boilerplate greatly. MobX seems to be the biggest contender out there. Also, it's not that complicated of a thing to implement for yourself :)
* Don't really see much difference from grabbing props from function like ({ value }) and using as value, vs. defining an input or class variable and using with this.value.
* RxJS integration is definitely the best part of Angular
* React doesn't have something like NgModules, you just import what you need where you need it. Components are mostly just functions, so just pass it around like a function.
* Not sure about your naming complaint. Nowhere in React does it make you name your components with index.js. You can name them whatever you want. 
* About versions, are you referring to all the main angular packages? @angular/core, @angular/common... Those are all by the same people, so of course they would follow the same version numbers. React is just React. I've found the angular package world to have the same versioning problems (not knowing if something supports Angular 2, 4, 5, or 6 just by version number).

I use Angular at work and React in my free time when messing around. If I had to choose one, I'd go React, just because I understand it's lifecycle state updating better and it's considerably faster/smaller (till Ivy comes out anyway). Both are good though.",1533861791.0

Eventually it lost out because every Backbone project hit a brick wall, while AngularJS kept going and going.  I think only time will tell, because consistent productivity is what makes a frontend framework a “survivor”.

For what it’s worth, I would put my money on Angular and Typescript for one simple reason: Facebook doesn’t have a browser.  Both of these technologies are designed with forthcoming web standards in mind, whereas React is more like a massive workaround/hack.  The things that make React, “React”, will become obsolete while the things that make Angular/Typescript what they are will become web standards.  Don’t like attributes?  Guess what - they’re an ECMAScript proposal.  You think JSX is special?  Guess what, Apple has template instantiation proposals which will largely make it (and virtual DOMs) obsolete.

When i became a lead on a team of non-front end developers I heavily pitched angular as i was an ""expert"" and i outlined much of what you've outlined in a DAR that i presented. The company still pushed me to react until someone much higher up in the company stated he wanted to see both at the company. Since then my part of the company is starting to do a total 180. My small team is the most productive in my division in the company and I've stated many times much of that is because of angular.

I just don't understand the mentality of react even having worked with it a lot, especially if you're a full stack engineer. Angular follows all of the good things that come out of other frameworks like spring boot. I feel like react is just php but all in javascript which, for me, is a step backwards.",1533858791.0
elh0mbre,"Angular makes a lot of decisions for you.  React you make them yourself.  This isn't an advantage for some people, but I personally enjoy the freedom.

Some other notes:

- I like DI.  I don't like it in my MVVM.  I also don't write as many tests as I should, so maybe I'd change my mind if I were doing that more.

- I agree on TypeScript.  I own the project I work on now, so we're using TypeScript.

- While you're not wrong about forms being a deficiency in React, forms were such a pain in the ass in Angular that I'm not sure it's actually an advantage (I haven't touched Angular in about 9 months, so this may have changed).

- The angular4 app I worked on last took 10-20 second to bootstrap itself even with lazy loading (no SSR), which is ridiculously slow.  The react app I work on now is bigger and loads immediately.

- You're right that if you're going to learn all of the pieces of Angular it's not more difficult to learn, but you don't have to learn them at all.  I work on a couple of fairly large apps. We don't use Redux at all (we have a wrapper around Flux).  We don't use Routing in one of them (two of them we use it sparingly).  Our http client is homegrown wrapper around $.Get/Post.

JevVoi,"I'm still just an Angular newbie, but I keep hearing people say Angular is so hard to learn, but coming from a .NET ASP web app with tons of ad-hoc jQuery, Angular clicked pretty quickly.

Maybe it's just that I got to Angular first and that I had a pretty good pluralsight training (yay)... but the team member that tried React (we wanted to make sure we covered our bases) was not impressed.

tme321,"I mostly agree.  I've said that the 3 best parts of angular are typescript, the di system, and rxjs.  And ngModules by themselves are a bit annoying but they do multiple jobs and once you understand what you can do with them they aren't a terrible solution to a complicated problem.

There are some solutions to the library paralysis problem of react like [next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/) and I believe Uber recently released their framework that uses react as the renderer.  But angular is still ahead a bit here I think because it's all designed together rather than developed separately and just glued together.

Personally though I disagree about jsx.  Some things, like dynamic component layouts, are **much** simpler with jsx and in general I think it just feels nice to use.

But with the flexibility jsx brings it also brings the ability to overcomplicate templates as you are pointing out.  It's a valid criticism where the best answer I have is ""learn to not do that"".  It's not like people don't also write terrible angular components; it's just shifting the potential pain points.

shadowmint,"I've used both in a significant capacity in the last two years and it boils down to two points:

React is fundamentally composable in a way that modules simply are not.

React native.

I won't bother with the second in detail, there are many discussions about react native and the pros and cons; but its undeniable angular has no equivalent.

Ng modules though! yeah, no.

If you've used material recently you'll see how 'best practice' is one component per module... and how dreadfully painful that is to both consume and to maintain.

By comparison, if you want to use a react component, just yarn/npm install and import it.

Maintenance of discrete component packages is also much easier, and (largely as a result) the 3rd party ecosystem is much richer.

Many of your points are very relevant, particularly with regard to redux, but dont write of HoC and render props without understanding what they are. The 16.4 context api is very good for simple purposes.

I recommend actually building (using typescript :) something in React and turn all the 'react create app' eslint warnings on, so you see what 'good' react looks like.

I maintain different things are suitable for different purposes... if your team wants to use react, why is that?

People (non idiots) don't just change *entire frameworks* for no reason, so I presume you're hitting some angular pain points.

What are those? Without knowing, its hard to say if react will solve them... but I will say this:

React is easy to get started with. ES6+ is very familiar to existing js developers. JSX has compile time checking.

For some teams, this is a set of compelling reasons.

For the same reason some teams choose promises over observables, React may be a better choice for some teams.

Shadowvines,a large pool of supporting repos and very little in the way of breaking updates. React for example has a solid  advantage if you need to use less common libraries like google maps or a fully matured material design library. at the moment angular has those libraries but they aren't that great and are missing a lot out of the box right now . in addition the migration from angularjs to angular really irked a lot of people. If you a business you like to see backwards compatibility that allows you to upgrade seamlessly on your own terms and angular really broke that. Even before that move from 1.3 and back to 1.5.8 and up was a rough go. Other than that angular is amazing and because of how new it is it has borrowed the best from a lot of worlds and is unrivaled in its ability to scale. Vue.js is IMO right now one of the best options for small scale applications over angular its system is so damn simple its amazing but as soon as you add complexity it gets just as hard as angular even with NUXT. regardless of simplicity angular outperforms it though and scales far better.,1533855056.0
sandangel91,"Haha, I have learned Angular and typescript first for about 2 months but, oh my god, it was too hard. I can’t remember how much I hated Angular. I didn’t understand even the hero tutorials with just Javascript and a little bit typescript. Then I tried Vue, it was very easy to pick up the concept. the syntax is really nice and the document is fantastic. And since then everything that I have learned about Angular started to make sense. When I develop a page with Vue, I realized that I missed the auto-completion in typescript, and Vuex can’t provide enough type safe when I come to deal with data from the server. Unfortunately, typescript support was lacking at that time. When you just build a simple app like an Invoice page, Vue is perfectly fine. I understand that I can’t build a complex app without a type system and I started to learn Angular again. I didn't look at React because of jsx.

This time everything becomes relevant. And DI is awesome. I think the observable is the most natural way to deal with user interactions. Rxjs operators make data transforming in the most elegant way.  Typescript started shinning when I have to refactor and clean up my code, hold Ctrl and hover the type to see the implementation, go to type definition when dealing with data, create and share type interface on both server and client in a monorepo, extract reusable components, logic to libraries. And schematics and ng update, ivy... OMG, I can't love Angular more.

I had to learn React when I changed my job. CRA was terrible that doesn't support typescript and even SCSS, scoped styling... LOL. To use flow-type I have to change to Nuclide IDE which has better support but really? Typescript is the most popular JavaScript alternative out there and VSCode is the most loved Text editor. I love my vs code vim setting, theme and I don’t want to use nuclide. I can get through that with rewire-react-app + some custom override-config to use typescript and styled-components for stylings. I think having CSS in JS and JSX is not too bad though. It helps me reduce the files to manage in the project a lot. In Vue, I still have to separate the ts file to have better ide support. CRA 2 may have a better support though but it is still in heavy development, too late. Vue CLI 3 just came out with full typescript support, Vue UI and the Angular console is freaky awesome. I miss the Angular days so much. If I could choose I would go with Vue for simple apps and Angular for more complex ones. ^^",1533941897.0
nationalhatefigure,"React has a couple of things which is making me lean more towards it:

* Testing feels a lot nicer in React. With Angular, beyond simple trivial projects, you have to add a \*lot\* of boilerplate just to get tests working properly. Doing unit tests in Angular is painful, since you either have to mock every component that's used or use NO\_ERROR\_SCHEMA which is troublesome. This is mostly fine if you have a very vertical app, but a mainly horizontal one (ie, a parent component is built up of many different types of components) then it starts getting nasty and ugly. Doing things like snapshot testing is easier in React and is a great way to have meaningful testing of web UI appearance.
* Redux is a lot more natural in React. ngRX, whilst cool, feels a lot hackier than plain Redux and harder to learn the concepts from. 
* The documentation is a lot better for me. This is always going to be a subjective point, but for me Angular really dropped the ball in many ways. I learn better from reading reference manuals, and having the Tour of Heroes pop up whenever I want to read about a concept in Angular is painful. Yes, there is a reference site, but finding it is usually more annoying than it should be. Also there's the big trap of looking for help on a thing in Angular only to find the AngularJS version cropping up without being properly labelled. I know there's tomes written on how Ang 2+ came from AngJS, and overall Ang 2 is what Angular needed. However, they really should have rebranded.
* The practicalities of hiring React developers vs Angular developers. The market (at least in London) for good Angular devs is a lot smaller than React devs. It's also really irritating going through CVs and trying to figure out if the dev is an Ang 2+ dev or if they just know AngJS, or it turns out they moved to Ang 2 on the last project they worked on, but only know the very basics. Of course, more React devs doesn't mean they're particularly better - of course the coolness of React will mean you have shitty coders trying to jump on the band wagon - but you get more choice after you sort the wheat from the chaff.
* Angular feels very prescriptive on what other libraries it's using, whilst React is more open. If you want to use SCSS or TypeScript in React, feel free. Which router library do you want to use? It's your choice. Whilst you can change the libraries in Angular as well, it's a lot more painful to do so. On the flip-side, this does mean that you need to know about which libraries and such to use with React, and jumping into someone else's project can be harder due to them using different stuff. 
* Using functional coding things like .map/.filter/.reduce in the render functions of React feels nicer and tidier than having a lot of ""for"" loop tags in Angular. Remembering the ng-tags is a pain in the ass for me whenever I come off doing an Angular project for a few months, whilst in React it's just basic coding. React's render method can get messy, but that's more down to the developers. They need to ensure they are breaking things up into functions properly and keep any actual logic outside of the render method. If you're using a tonne of ternaries in there, then there's quite probably a better way to do it. 

There's more, but they've been said before or are very much personal taste.",1533887102.0

infamoustrey,"One fundamental misconception is that react and angular are the same type of framework and that you have to fully commit into the react ecosystem if you want to use it like you do with angular. 

I know you said react is just as hard to learn as angular  but the simple fact is that for someone who already knows a bit of JavaScript it isn't. This is mainly due to the modularity of React's ecosystem. You can build react apps in a way that let's you use traditional (and most of the time incorrect) techniques. 

Angular by contrast forces you to build your apps in a certain way because it's not just one piece of a framework, it's the whole damn thing.

Now this isn't to say that one is ""better"" than the other. Angulars strong handed methodology makes it easier to manage large scale spas but tends to be Overkill when you just want a little reactivity in a website.

ArcanisCz,"it has simplicity and freedom. As for points you made, most of them are points AGAINTS angular, in my point of view

- typescript - most of the time unneeded (i came from JAVA), too much typing. (For some parts of code, it can be useful)
- CSS - react is unopinionated here. You can choose to use less, sass, inline-css, etc.
- async rendering - i dont know what are you talking about. In react, i can control rendering in quite fine-grained and simple manner. If props or state changes, components re-render (we use redux and redux-saga). I can rewrite saga's logic to change whats happening when without needind to revrite whole app.
- redux - its the way we reason about app. In scale, it simplifies things and makes app maintainable. It needs a bit practice and training, people cannot structure redux properly from the go though.
- react-redux-connect is awesome lightweight and universal. I have used @Input and @Output and it sucked for me
- accessing props - i have no problem, and i thing its pretty ergonomic in react
- RxJs if you feel like trule RxJs person, try https://cycle.js.org/
- Dependency injection - es6 imports and sometimes Context are far enought for us.
- JSX - look at that proprietary angular template syntax first ;)
- NgModules sucks. But its true that alot of thinking went into how to structure large react app. Used NgModules but there are some ugly small things there... Really not impressed
- Forms - react is unopinionaned. You can implement things by yourself, or pick framework. We used redux-form and after the while, it works quite well. But i agree, not widely used and accepted library is present.
- naming convention is up to the you and team, we had no problems
- dependencies - probably JS and NPM problem rather than react or angular

See the differencies in view? :D it really depends on how you want to write applications than about whether react an angular is better.

the2baddavid,"From someone who only looked into react:

I think the templates are more powerful because it's not markup, so you can just do stuff instead of using a directive. At least, it appears that way. However, templates in angular are easier on designers which is nice. 

There's less of a learning curve. You get to use the JavaScript you already know instead of needing to learn type script, angular's extensions (like null coalescing operator in templates), Rxjs, etc, on top of the rest of the  framework. I love observables now but there's definitely a learning curve which takes time. I could see how that would be daunting.

UrbanKristan,"I've had to move from doing some part of an application in React to Angular. 

You know what's the funny thing? I miss typescript.

The Angular templates basically throw all type safety out the window. Sure, the Angular service does some very limited checking when using properties of a component in its template, but inputs you pass to child components get no checking at all. This means that \~half the code of the application gets no help with refactoring. The contracts that the components declare are completely void, because they are only applied within the component, but not at all when the contract would be most useful.

**It's like if you declared the types of the arguments of a function, but the typechecking only checked your usage of those arguments within the functions body and not when calling the function, which is arguably more important. The contract that a component declares is never enforced.** ",1533883535.0
usersliff,"I honestly feel like a majority of your pain points are coming from your team's decisions for the project you are working on.

React-Typescript is a wonderful combo (yes, you'd have some `any` implicits and casts here and there, but who doesn't :P) and you could incrementally introduce it to your project with a slight change of your webpack config or by using the excellent parcel-bundler (https://parceljs.org).

As for `css-modules` (just hoping you're at least using sass), it provides more readability for your code and encapsulates your css to avoid name collisions and undesired style related side effects. 
Even better - use a css-in-js library (`emotion`, `styled-components`, etc.) to finally have your style to reflect the state of your components. It makes so much sense.

I am not sure to understand your statement about ""async rendering"" in Angular, are you addressing the ""async pipe"" or the code splitting? Or the ""multithreading"" via service worker? Actually it is so simple to make a component to load asynchronously in React - just await the esnext dynamic import and voilà you have your component ready to be used, when in Angular the only code splitting you can use (with AoT) is the one made automatically by RouterModule.

I also feel your frustration with Redux and omg I feel you bro. All this Redux hype made it kinda mandatory for React projects, but it shouldn't be! It should be used in certain cases and the official documentation (aka Dan Abramov) states it pretty clearly in ""You might not need Redux"" (great read btw!) so you should consider going with classic React props drilling, Mobx or make use of the new React Context API which is pretty neat.

Another reason that lets me think you're abusing Redux (hence your frustration) is because the @Input @Output equivalent in React is just the classic props and not `react-redux`'s connect. And by the way I find the React patterns of props much more powerful than Angular's - you can pass multiple props to a child by destructuring, you can easily implement memorization technique because props is always an object and is immutable, and there's none of the NgZone black magic ;) 
Next, the DI - it is purely subjective but I find that the ES module system is enough to provide the needed module wherever it is needed, you can use conditional exports and mock this stuff well enough with Jest for your tests.

And I am sorry to say it, but the NgModules are a really awful concept for front-end where we should remain as flexible and agile as we can - every refactor is a pain and it is a much cleaner pattern to just `import` a component and let the ES module resolution to do it's job, then just use your component and all of its dependencies without all this useless boilerplate.
And JSX naturally emerge from this pattern, which is, in itself, a much more powerful and flexible tool than the templates - I highly recommend you to watch this video from 2013 by Pete Hunt which introduces the concepts of JSX https://youtu.be/x7cQ3mrcKaY.

jcrimbo,"Couldn't agree more. I've spent a year+ with Angular 2-6, and a few years with AngularJS before that. I've been wondering, ""what have I been missing?"" given React's popularity.

So, I've researched React and gone through tutorials, but haven't used it in a production app (because I haven't had to) - so I can't state what you said with the same conviction, but I'd come to the same conclusions: This doesn't seem intuitive or readable! Why would you choose this approach for implementing UI components? Where is my dependency injection? How is this learning curve simpler?

It may be fair to say that ""plain React"" is a simpler abstraction to grok coming from jQuery or plain javascript + HTML. No typescript + transpilation to understand (which could be a black box, particularly for devs that don't understand the value of strong typing). I don't know, it's hard for me to put myself in those shoes.

My take is that React surpassed AngularJS because it was simpler and more efficient, and because Angular2 took so long to see the light of day. Also, ReactNative and Redux added pieces that were missing in old AngularJS. And now React is coasting on the momentum that it gathered during the AngularJS -> Angular2 gap.

When Angular2 came out, it provided a nice clean programming model, but wasn't yet competitive with React in code size or perf. And, some of the perf best-practices aren't enabled out of the box (eg `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`). There's a lot to be said for small and fast, and I think this hurt the perception of ""new Angular"".

However these issues are getting chipped away at - Angular 6 is quite a bit snappier (for development and at run time), and you can swap in Jest instead of Karma and Cypress instead of Protractor for nicer + faster development cycles.

With the Ivy Renderer and the Closure compiler getting integrated, we can expect Angular web apps to continue getting smaller + faster.

Long story short: I'll take a clean, modular, cohesive programming model, backed by a team that has a strong incentive to address the perf and other deficiencies.

FrankieCutlets,"I like that Angular has never been opinionated about your model layer. React forces you to have pure immutable data, and while that’s a plus for many people, with Angular I could build an entire object-oriented model layer independent of the Angular framework, and then my components can just manage objects that manage themselves.  

Also, I can’t help but feel like people have completely exaggerated the difficulty of state management. I agree with one-way data flow, and once you’ve achieved that how hard is it to just write your own services that store data how you need it and notify others of changes?

2) Why is your navigation component called AccountComponent? Or does every component in your application have to have this navigation bar html to make it work?

3) You have an account-minimal.component.html but now account-minimal.component.ts and you don't import it anywhere. Why is that? Is that just so you can post code on the walkthrough?

4) This doesn't feel like a walkthrough. There are no steps and no in depth explanations about how to use the code. It's basically just some code generic nav code snippets. I don't feel like I understand what's going on.

theShetofthedog,"Try initializing like this:

currenciesJson:any=[];",1533676352.0
tme321,"Couple of quick things:

Most likely you are attempting to access the array inside the component with the ngFor loop before it is set to a value.  Since it is null that means you are probably getting a null reference error.  Initializing it to an empty array as /u/theShetofthedog suggested is the quick fix.

Also, I didn't pour over the code but I see you have an ngIf on a loading flag.  I see the loading flag is flipped inside a test function but didn't see that called anywhere.  I believe what you want to do is set the loading flag to true when the promise resolves in the then block where you are setting the currency array.

Further things to consider time permitting:

Use observables not promises.  Observables are used in numerous parts of angular so your better off learning them sooner rather than later.  Observables are promises that can resolve multiple times, not just once.  But they also *can* just resolve once.  So you can do anything with an observable that you can do with a promise but you can't do everything with a promise that you can do with observables.

Also, instead of manually setting the value to a member inside the component you could just use the async pipe on the promise / observable directly.  That also takes care of the null reference issue.  The potential downside is that the component controller no longer has a direct reference to the data that was resolved but that isn't an issue depending on how you architect everything.

But yeah most likely your issue is either a null reference error, the loading flag not being flipped, or both.",1533679306.0

tme321,"A lot of good stuff has already been said by other people in here so I'm just going to explain at a high level.

If you subscribe to the mvc architecture for your application then putting your state, or model, inside a component, even just a top level one that doesn't really do anything else, is breaking the separation between the model and the controllers.

The reason that pattern exists in the first place is that separating the sections of the app and having loose coupling allows faster and easier development and refactoring of the individual parts.  It also helps reduce bugs by having well defined mechanisms through which the parts communicate with each other.

So by creating an entirely separate model with ngrx you can make the store worry about model concerns and even do large scale changes or additions and have minimal, or even 0, changes to the controllers or the view.  You can make changes to the internals all you want as long as the public api part of the model stays the same and be relatively sure that your changes won't have unintended consequences.

That doesn't mean you can't do the way you describe.  It just means that your way is more error prone.  There are a whole host of potential issues that you didn't suggest any solution for.  You might have those solutions in place but you had to come up with them.  Ngrx has already solved those problems for many other people so why would they implement it themselves?",1533510794.0

But ngrx helps you abstract the data to actions and effects, hopefully simplifying state management.",1533506841.0
MJomaa,"That's true. The single source of truth becomes important when the app gets bigger. One could use a shared service with observables to solve that problem (aka mobx) or you know.. just use ngrx/ngxs. Doesn't matter that much imo. I prefer ngrx/ngxs because it clearly decouples application logic from structural logic. Code is read more often than it is written, so make it easier for the reader to understand your module/application... even if it means that you need a little more boilerplate.

NPM was always criticized especiall by Angular community for not accounting  for ""behind the firewall npm downloads"", let me explain how this works, because this is the same setup as at our enterprise, most big enterprises don't connect directly to npm but use an internal proxy npm, which also handles caching, so when i do npm install, I don't get all packages directly from npm but from our internal proxy, which checks the cache if it's up to date with npm, if it is, the proxy hands me the cached version to go fatser.

NPM stats don't account for those downloads which is REALLY bad for Angular because it's mostly an enterprise framework, and most of the enterprise world uses this internal npm proxy technique, so most of the downloads don't even show up on the official npm stats.

My theory is they've made a huge update to the stats system, went down for the update, (which explains the dip), and then when they've went up again the stats started to account for behind the firewalls downloads, which turned out to be a huge chunk of angular downloads, as we all expected.",1533460416.0

javajunkie314,"It's difficult to give a general answer, but if you're using an observable and modifying the emitted objects, you're probably *doing it wrong* ^TM . The observable won't ""know"" about the changes you're making, and the next emitted value will clobber your modified value.

The solution is probably to stop modifying the objects directly and treat them as immutable. Instead, you could add a method to the service that's supplying your observable, so it can make the change further ""upstream"", and then the observable will emit the new value and your view will update.

You can take this idea further, which is how you wind up with the flux pattern and libraries like [ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/master/docs/store/README.md) and [ngxs](https://github.com/ngxs/store/blob/master/README.md) ^1 . In this pattern, all state lives in a central store, and you send messages to make changes or updates. Then you subscribe to the store to get the latest state whenever it changes. It's probably different from how you're used to managing state (independently in each controller), but it recognizes that state-management is a cross-cutting concern, and having information for in one direction (messages go to the dispatcher, new values come from the store) makes it easier to reason about shared state bring updated in multiple places.

^1 They implement the pattern more-or-less. There's disagreement about what the pattern even is exactly, and how closely they implement it. Big picture, though, they do. Of the two, ngrx is older and had the bigger community, but ngxs is designed to avoid some pain-points of ngrx.

Edit: I just read that you're working with the result of an http request. It's still good to let `async` manage the subscription (or at least to manage it yourself), so that, for example, the request can be cancelled if the component goes away before it completes.

Maybe the best fit would be create both, a class and a service. You can easily refactor your current class as a service, and inject it in the class rather than the component.

The class will handle the configuration of the WebSocket and provide methods for the component, the service will provide all the shared re-usable methods for the actual WebSocket connection. If you need several instances of the service, you can provide it somewhere else than the module.

So, the class will instantiate the service through dependency injection, while the component will instantiate the class through the \`new\` keyword. ",1533509244.0

FrankieCutlets,"I know the best practice is to use @Output, but passing a single object to a child component can be convenient (especially if the hierarchy is more than one level). 

As a nice middle ground, sometimes I’ll put callback functions on the @Input object, which the child component can call, like “myObject.onPropertyChanged(newValue)”. This way the reassignment can still happen in the parent component (or you could have the object reassign the value to itself).

I once tried to ask about the benefits/pitfalls of this approach on Stack Overflow, but only one person replied in the comments. But the question contains an example of what I mean:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47743281/refactoring-angular-components-from-many-inputs-outputs-to-a-single-config-objec

[https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/src/lib/checkbox/checkbox.html](https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/src/lib/checkbox/checkbox.html)

you could change the shape of the div and the SVG on your own and create an X version and you will need to add your own custom version of the module in your application. be sure to rename everything so it doesn't conflict with the normal version.

Extrix,"Firstly, next() doesn't work because when you create an Observable using of, this Observable that is created will simply emit all the arguments and then complete. It's a cold Observable, only emitting when it's subscribed to... then completing.

Something like a Subject or BehaviourSubject does not immediately complete and thats what you can continually pass values through. In this particular code though, I feel like using an Observable to get a username from a service is overkill.

You could make the argument that what if the user logs out and a new user logs in, it changes. Still overkill.

Like AlDrag said, just create a function in your authService to return the username from a variable in authService. Whenever you need the username, just called this.authService.getUserName(); If the user logs out and logs into a different account, simply update the variable in authService.

Taking it one step further: You could also store your user's username in storage and then in your authService constructor, you can retrieve the username from storage and set it as the username variable.",1533083671.0

You're going to have to code your components in a way that doesn't rely on Angular for little things like handling onclick events and so on. 

Interesting idea. Let us know if you come up with something",1533097532.0
tme321,"Well first off messing around with it it seemed to be working pretty well.  It doesn't allow me to over allocate any of the values; and it even properly handled when I forced negative numbers into the input fields into the character creator form.

I think the interface could use a little more work.  Maybe increment and decrement buttons for the skills?  Or maybe sliders?  It certainly works as is but there is room for improvement so consider iterating on the interface some.

Overall the code looks pretty good.  I didn't look at all of it but mostly it was just nit picky things like in the die component's createMessage function you switched to ALL CAPS for the const names for no discernible reason.  It draws my eye to that part and makes me thing it's really important but I can't figure out why.  But I don't consider that stuff deal breakers just something you might want to be careful of in the future.

Code organization leaves something to be desired though.  There are many different ways to be organized, so it's a highly opinionated topic, but I feel like your structure won't scale well.

First I don't like just sticking all services under a _services folder.  Or any of those top level file types folders.  Also I don't understand why those folders are prepended with an _.  

Second just in general you have all the individual components spammed into directories off the base folder.  It won't be fun later to scroll through a directory with 100 components each in their own folder.

So, there are numerous ways to organize this better, but my personal preference is to organize stuff by usage rather than file type.  For instance you have a messages component and a messages service.  I would put both in the same folder, messages.  Then any time you want to work on the messages part of the app it's a single folder with an obvious name rather than having to bounce back and forth between a messages folder and a _services folder.

Then I would make a messages ngmodule also in the messages folder.  That module could then export the messages component and provide the messages service.  That way you have a complete self contained feature and in order to use it you just import the messages module into the main app module.

I would also do the same with, for instance, all the characters stuff.  You could have 1 top level folder called characters and inside it put the characters component.  Then you can use sub folders for each other character* component like create and skills.  So you end up with

    > characters
        characters.component.ts
        *.html
        ...
        > character-create
            character-create.component.ts
            *.html
            ...
        > character-skills
            character-skills.component.ts
            *.html
            ...
        etc...

That way all of the parts containing to characters are in the same spot.  Then you can make a characters module inside the base characters directory and have it import and export all the individual components and provide the character service.

Basically, organize by feature rather than by file type and use ngmodules to hide the specifics of the characters feature from the main app module.  The main app module just becomes responsible for importing each of these sub feature modules.

Long term you can think about using a shared folder to organize all the shared features, So like maybe end up with:

    > app
        > characters
        > shared
            > messages
            > alerts
            ...

Or some structure that looks something like that.

So, yeah my overall take is it looks pretty good code wise, nothing major sticks out from what I saw.  And the functionality seems fine and passes basic attempts to mess it up.  But long term you should consider general code organization.",1533056178.0

To me that says you need to be putting FormControls inside the items, not FormGroups.

Also if you refer to the [documentation on FormBuilder](https://angular.io/api/forms/FormBuilder) you will also see that the array method's first parameter is defined as:

>controlsConfig	

>An array of child controls. The key for each child control is its index in the array.

Why the array's first parameter is typed any[] instead of FormControl[] I don't know.  Probably something they need to clean up and you could consider submitting a bug report.

But regardless, I don't believe you can do it the exact way you are trying to.  The way the forms work, I believe, is first you give it a group or an array and then which thing to access inside that.

So, if I were you, I'd probably change the way you are building the overall formGroup so that you are using an array of form controls or a form group of items indexed on something other than an index.

Maybe someone else has done this before and can provide you with a way.  But I don't see one offhand.

tme321,"Breaking an app up into the correctly sized components is basically a skill that comes from experience.  There aren't any hard and fast rules and what makes sense for 1 app might not in another.

For your particular problem here certainly you could break each chart up into it's own component and that definitely could have long term benefits like being able to easily put a single chart or a select few charts in another part of the app with ease.  I can't tell you for sure what the best way to approach this is given your specific app.

However, from what little I know about the situation my instincts would be to:

1.  Create a model that can be read by the outermost parent container to tell it how many charts to create and what information each individual chart will need to function correctly.  Maybe a top level container of some information the parent component needs plus an array of individual chart models.

2.  NgFor over the array of chart models and send each one into a generic chart component.

3.  Use a service where all the charts created can register themselves and then have the service responsible for making the X number of api calls and providing the data back down to each specific chart.

That way you can just add a new item into the chart models array that the parent container holds and get a new chart ""for free"".

And by using the service to make the api calls you can do stuff like make sure you only send X requests to the api at a time so you don't overload it and then either feed the results back into the individual charts as it comes in or hold the data until all the requests are complete and then give all the charts their data at the same time; that way the syncing of the api calls and chart rendering can be controlled by you from a single location rather than having 15 different chart components that each do the same thing.

So, yeah that's my initial impression of how I would handle this.",1532788427.0

You can do ""anything"" with it, but the way you have to do things sometimes is fucking weird and even counter-intuitive, whereas AngularJS is pretty straightforward. To give you an example, in AngularJS there is `emit` to talk to children and `broadcast` to talk to parents. In Angular, you have to use `@Input()` and `@Output()` and pass references through the html, and sometimes even that doesn't work right, and you have to use `EventEmitter` and services.

Ember have been the framework that actually feels like a complete framework for years. They have been pioneering a lot of stuff that we now (more or less) take for granted. For example: the cli (and add-ons), (routable)components and a lot more.
I love their object model including especially the computed properties (they can be a bit weird to wrap your head around, but when it clicks you will love it).
I love their template-language formerly known as Handlebars.

I hate Ember Data, conceptually it's great but in practice it's too assuming about the backends response structure and naming conventions. I know there are ways around that, but it's hard.
If you have a legacy backend with non consistent naming conventions you will have a hard time using Ember Data.
However Ember and Ember Data are not tightly coupled. You can perfectly fine use Ember without Ember Data.

Another hate point is: best practices seems to change a lot. Sometimes they promote a certain style of code convention but in practice it's not really there yet (routable components).

Their own documentation is really good but 3rd party docs and tutorials get out of fashion quickly.
There are a lot of plugins that *nearly* work or used to work but don't anymore...

Anyway, jokes aside a very good article.  But I would like to comment on a few points.

>**We don’t need another winner**

Cannot stress this enough.  Competition breeds innovation whereas a monopoly breeds stagnation.  I'm all for having 3+ good popular choices and numerous smaller ones for those that really want to explore off the beaten path.

>complex enterprise applications

Can we please stop repeating this though?  It's possible to produce enterprise level react apps and it's also viable to use Angular in small applications.  For years developers have used frameworks like wpf and spring, which map relatively closely to Angular's feature set, for ""small"" applications.  

A lot of it comes down to experience.  If you have enough experience with Angular you can quickly and easily produce small things.  If you are experienced with React you can produce large high quality complex things.  The distinction that Angular is for enterprise is just ridiculous.

>That’s where React is so much powerful over Angular, where dynamic instantiation is definitely more verbous (may it change in the future, it’d be awesome).

100% true but maybe a bit overstated.  True for obvious reasons for anyone who has done dynamic component layouts in both frameworks.  

But I say overstated a bit in Angular because while there is that stupid boilerplate it's relatively simple to copy and paste it into a single directive for your application and then reuse it over the whole thing.  

Definitely an annoyance that I would like to do without but you only set it up once and then you are basically done.

For now the ComponentOutlet is still marked as experimental though so I do agree with the overall point.

Personally I'm still holding out hope that the new renderer will make it possible to use jsx even though I'm pretty sure that even doing that will still require the same ceremony with regards to dynamic components unless something really clever is done with the jsx for ng compiler.",1532240665.0

* User Logs in like you have it, using JWT.
* User is in one or more roles.
* An ""Authorization Service"" controls how different assets (Buttons, links, Routes, etc.) respond to user roles. Visibility and ""enabled-ness"" can differ for each role. There might be a different response if the user is ""Unauthenticated"" (not logged in...which might result in a redirect) versus ""Unauthorized"" (logged in, but lacking access which might result in an asset being disabled or invisible).
* To apply this data, use Directives which apply to an asset (AssetID=""123"") and has injected access to the Asset Role Access Resolution Data you've created to manage data via the authorization service.
* To Secure Routes against unauthorized access you use guards.
* The API (I'm using an [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) CORE Web API back end)  should be secured via Authorization attributes on the API Controllers and/or their methods.
* All API calls should be HTTPS.
* Should someone hack the front end, get by the API, the database can ultimately be the guard against who has access to what slices of data (""WHERE CreatedByUserID=\[@USerID\]"", etc.).
* Looking into managing user and authorization state via NGRX

Tips:

* if you need to authenticate a user via email/password, first thing is to use https of course, and look into JWT authentication
* Don't roll your own security stuff if at all possible.

tme321,"That's a very open ended question so it will be hard to give you a definitive answer.  But yes there are many ways you can handle that without repeating that code over and over.

The absolute simplest is to offload that logic to a service and inject the service into all 3 components.

You can also create selectors that both directly select the user data and the isLoading value separately.

The first question that pops up in my mind is why do you need to make local references to the individual fields?  Usually I would structure my template to take the values directly from an async pipe.

The retrieving of component texts could also be done as a mapping operation off of the user selector.

So with incomplete information I would make 2 more selectors, 1 for the user data and 1 for the loading flag.  Then I would make a service that sets 2 of its members to the result of those 2 selectors on the store.  And then I would also make the service hold an observable of component texts and make an observable that takes the user observable and maps it to that call to DashboardContent.

Then that service is taking care of all this state and you just inject the service into each component and use the async pipe to get the data onto the templates.

Another question though is why is the component texts not being selected from the store?  That is how I would structure this so the service only has to select 3 different fields from the store and nothing else.",1531725156.0

I decided to introduce an injectable middleware layer that contains the logic for checking the status of the old password and returns an enum with the goal not to complicate my services and have them do a single job only. Whereas for my component are only to show the results based on simple conditions.

As for the code: 

My service became:

    async CheckPassword2(id: string, password: string): Promise<boolean> {
            return this.http.get<Promise<boolean>>('/checkpassword/'+id+'/' + password).toPromise();
        }

My middleware:

    public async CheckCurrentPassword(id: string, control: AbstractControl): Promise<StatusEnum> {
    
            let currentPassword: string = control.value;
            console.log(currentPassword);
            console.log(id);
            if (currentPassword === null || currentPassword === undefined) 
                { return StatusEnum.None; }
            let result: boolean = await this.service.CheckPassword2(id, currentPassword);
    
            if (result !== null && result !== undefined) {
                if (result === true) {
                    return StatusEnum.Found;
                } else {
                    return StatusEnum.NotFound;
                }
            }      
        }

Inside the component:

    async UpdatePassowrd() {
        if (!this.changePasswordForm.valid) {
          FieldValidator.validateAllFormFields(this.changePasswordForm);
        } else {
         let status: StatusEnum = await this.controller.CheckCurrentPassword(this.ID, this.currentPassword);
        }
      }

Angular 7/8 will come with a completely new renderer (called 'Ivy') which is going to further improve the performance.

Really though, at the end of the day, both are incredible fast nowadays and it is more up to the developer to make use of the features, like using OnPush for change detection, not spamming events etc.",1531587930.0
robwormald,"Your understanding of how this works is basically correct.

Consider an Angular Component and a React Component:

    @Component({
      selector: 'my-comp',
      template: `<h1>Hello {{name}}!</h1>
    })
    class MyComp {
      @Input() name: string;
    }
    
    
    class MyComp extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <h1>Hello {this.props.name}!</h1>;
      }
    }

The primary difference between how Angular and React work has to do with how we think about UIs.

Angular's compiler analyzes the template, and generates a new function that handles updating the DOM and data-binding. Our `<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>` template becomes something like (note that this is psuedo-code, but its representative)

    function MyComp_template(creationMode:boolean, context:MyComp){
      //this runs the first time the template gets created
      if(creationMode){
        //create the h1 node, and store a reference to it and index 0
        elementStart(0, 'h1');
          //create the text node, store a reference to it at index 1, and memoize the bound value
          createTextNode(1);
        elementEnd();
      }
      //this runs every time change detection runs
      //grab or create the textNode binding reference at index 0
      //memoize or check the existing value from the context
      //if the value has changed, update the actual DOM.
      textBinding(1, interpolate('Hello ', name, '!'));
    }

Importantly, we store the references to the DOM nodes we create an an array, and also store the current value of that node:

    const domNodes = [h1, text];
    const boundValues = [null, 'World'];

so that when we update, we're never *reading* from the DOM (which is slow) - we read from our representation of the DOM, and use those values to diff the bound values / update the actual DOM:

    //pseudo text binding instruction
    function textBinding(index, boundFn){
      //get the DOM node reference
      const node = domNodes[index];
      //get the existing bound value
      const storedValue = boundValues[index];
      //execute the binding function
      const currentValue = boundFn();
      //if the values don't match, update the DOM with the new text and store it.
      if(storedValue !== currentValue){
        node.nodeValue = currentValue;
        boundValues[index] = currentValue;
      }
    }


The transpiled-from-JSX version of our React component looks like this

    class MyComp extends React.Component {
      render() {
        //each time the component renders, return a VirtualDOM computed from the inputs
        return React.createElement(
          ""h1"",
          null,
          ""Hello "",
          this.props.name,
          ""!""
         );
        }
    }

Each time the `render()` method executes, it returns a *new* VirtualDOM tree - it's then React's job to compute the differences between the previously generated virtual DOM and the new one, and then apply those changes to the actual DOM.

(this is extremely psuedocode, because I am not a react expert!)

    function reactRender(reactComponent, node){
      //get the current virtual DOM
      const currentVdom = currentDomForNode(node);
      //call the render method to get the new vdom
      const newVdom = reactComponent.render();
      //diff the old and new vdoms to get a list of changes to the DOM
      const changes = reactDiff(currentVdom, newVdom);
      //apply those changes to the real DOM
      changes.forEach(reactApplyChangeToDom);
    }

Both of these approaches are significantly more complicated than described above, but that's the general gist. There's a lot they have in common - minimizing changes to the real DOM by operating on a ""virtual"" representation - pretty much all UI frameworks nowadays store some representation of the DOM, ""virtually"". In Angular, we call this the ""Logical DOM"" - each component instance stores this data in what we call a ""Logical View"".

From a pure performance point of view, there's no simple answer as to which is ""better"". Like all things in programming, it's about tradeoffs.

I think (this is usually where I get in trouble...) that's its fair to say that React-style UI-as-a-function-of-state systems can be more flexible from the developer's point of view - a developer can generally return *any* virtual DOM representation from the render function, and it's the library's job to turn those changes into real DOM. By contrast, Angular treats a template (component or `<ng-template>` or otherwise) as the basic unit of composition - within a template, a developer defines their HTML + bindings statically, which can sometimes require more up-front thinking about composition. Templates are ""just"" HTML, which can enable more inclusion of designers in the development process.

The tradeoff (and part of the philosophy Angular is built around) is that templating allows Angular to deeply understand a template, and generate highly optimized code, in both pure CPU cycles, but low memory consumption and garbage collection. The flexibility of being able to return whatever from a JSX-style `render()` function means the framework has to be able to handle whatever, and each time a new virtual DOM representation is created, it can consume a fair amount of memory - especially important on low end devices. Again, this is not generally relevant except in edge cases, but it is a tradeoff. All modern frameworks provide a number of ways to optimize which components get rendered, and developers can create extremely performant apps with all of them. It should also be said that developers can create extremely not-performant apps with all of them as well, and part of our job on Angular is to prevent that from happening, where possible.

Angular doesn't have a page on our docs detailing the internals of how Angular's view engine works, and this is on purpose (mostly) - in fact, we've changed the implementation internally twice already, with the aim of making Angular apps smaller and faster. We'll be doing the same thing again with the new Ivy view engine - this is one of the biggest strengths of a template + compiler based framework - the same constraints that templates bring allow us to evolve and optimize Angular over the long term, and as the Web Platform improves, Angular developers can get those improvements for free. This doesn't come without complexity costs, but that's something we're constantly improving.

For example - there's a [proposal](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Template-Instantiation.md) being worked on by the Web Components working group that may eventually provide some of the low level machinery that Angular currently implements in the framework. There are a number of interesting ideas floating around about making Web Workers more flexible and allowing better access to the DOM from them - similarly Web Assembly provides a whole new set of APIs to explore. 

All of these things could eventually be ""backends"" for Angular - without your templates changing, and we're participating in these discussions to help make these platform primitives useful for modern frameworks.

On the Angular team, we try very hard to not do ""versus"" comparisons - they're usually not helpful in evaluating what *your* project needs. We do think it's useful to understand how other projects think about this stuff, and learn from the things that developers like about using those projects. I'd love to implement something like Vue's Single File Components format. I don't think it's completely insane that someone (important: not the Angular team, we have too much to do already) builds something JSX based on top of Ivy one day. We want Angular to be a platform that's flexible enough to allow you do to whatever you need to do to be successful building cool stuff.

Uhmmm... with React, it's also a ""no-go"" to use jQuery. jQuery is for DOM manipulation. React is for DOM manipulation. Why would you use them both?

Look, I can save everyone the trouble of ever writing another ""Angular vs React"" article again:

Do you want an everything-out-of-the-box (and thus ""opinionated"") framework? Angular.

Do you want to have choices in what technologies you'd like to use beyond the View? React.

THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE ONLY BUSINESS DECISION TO MAKE*.

Both are good for small apps. Both are good for large apps. Both are comparable in speed. Both have a learning curve (I would say Angular's curve is steeper, but with React you may have to learn more technologies, so it's a wash, really.)

,"The dispatch method, dispatches an action to your reducers.

In these reducers you're ""listenening"" on actions in order to mutate your store state.

For example if we take a look at the [ngrx StackBlitz seed](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngrx-seed?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts), we're dispatching an `Increment` or a `Decrement` action. In the reducer file (located at `src/reducers/counter.reducer.ts`), we have a reducer and based on the action type we're either incrementing or decrementing the current counter state.

Ionic 4 is essentially a collection of custom elements that can be used in straight Angular 6, React, Vue, etc. You would be making the app in straight Angular 6 with Ionic's components available for use. These are things like action sheets, date pickers, and other UI components. One can pick for them to have an iOS or Material Design style.

I can't speak to the quality of them, they look okay but ultimately it didn't work for my company as we didn't want to be dependent on their components and locked into their overall theme/design although I think its decent.

They also charge you for what you can upload to the app store for free.

ts

I find that to be so annoying personally.  I prefer to split up by feature.  Something more like:

    |-- shared
      |-- [+] Alerts Displayer Component
        |-- alerts.component.ts/html/css/spec

        |-- [+] Alerts Specific Directive
          |-- alerts-specific.directive.ts/spec

Then I can use the module in that folder to hide the specific child components and only export the component that is the public one, the alerts displayer.

And any time I want to work with the alerts system at all it's all nicely packaged into one subdirectory.  No bouncing back up to the level above the alerts component then over to the directives directory of the shared folder.  Once I'm inside the alerts sub folder everything I need to do with alerts is in there (minus non-alert specific stuff that the alert components might happen to use of course).

Organization by feature instead of by file type allows me to seemlessly work on a feature without bouncing all over my directories.

I've done the organize by top level ""features"" and then inside each feature organize by file type many times including in other languages and frameworks where that's the accepted style.  And I don't think it adds anything even to large code bases.

tme321,"Ok so first, this is doable and not particularly hard.  But second, it is a lot wordier than how you would do it with React.

So having said that, fundamentally what you want to do is use the [Angular dynamic component loader](https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-component-loader).  Those directions show you how to implement it yourself, but it's really some boilerplate.  There are various libraries on npm that implement the boilerplate if you want to look into those.  I haven't ever used any of them so I can't suggest a particular one.

[This is an example](https://github.com/tme321/Unopinionated-Angular/blob/master/src/app/lib/dynamic-component/dynamic-component.directive.ts) I have written of a dynamic component loader.  There's nothing particularly fancy going on here.  I've just copied the boilerplate and added in the ability to specify providers for a particular dynamic component.  I also wrapped it inside a directive instead of a component.

I use that component loader inside a [dropdown menu](https://github.com/tme321/Unopinionated-Angular/blob/master/src/app/lib/dropdown-input/dropdown-input.component.ts).  Basically the goal was to be able to create a text input filter with a dropdown list that could display something like an image next to text.  A fancy replacement for a <select> element basically.

The way I wrote the component it actually just displays whatever is provided to it by a service.  So an example of the service is implemented [here](https://github.com/tme321/Unopinionated-Angular/blob/master/src/app/demo-dropdown-service/demo-dropdown-input.service.ts) where the important part, for this post, is the fetchData function.  There you can see that I am sending an array of objects with the data necessary to instantiate the components dynamically.  The dropdown component takes that list and applies it across a list of dynamic component loaders which basically is just:

    <li *ngFor=""let compData of dynamicComponentsData; let i = index;"">
        <ng-template [uat-dynamic-component]=""compData""></ng-template>
    </li>

Now, you probably don't need that level of indirection.  You can certainly just write most (or even all but I would recommend breaking it up at least somewhat) of that code into a single component.  But the idea is basically the same.  My advice is come up with a model to represent which dynamic component you are going to instantiate along with any init data that component might need similar to [my example](https://github.com/tme321/Unopinionated-Angular/blob/master/src/app/lib/dynamic-component/dynamic-component-data.interface.ts) but of course changed to suit your specific needs.  Then create your own dynamic component or directive which takes that model and uses it to instantiate the component.  And then you can just create the top level component, TreeViewer or whatever, that takes in your collection of models and passes them off to your dynamic component creator.

>It can also call any handlers passed belonging to the parent component.

You **could** pass handlers down inside the model I suggested above.  The more Angular way to do it would be to inject a service instead and use the service to orchestrate communication.  Maybe something like:

    @Injectable()
    class HandleClickService {
        handleClick(e: MouseEvent) {
            //do the thing when a click happens
        }
    }

    @Component({
        template: `
            <div (click)=""onClick($event)"">A Dynamic Component</div>
    `
    })
    class SomeDynamicallyCreatedComponent {
        constructor(private clickService: HandleClickService) {}

        onClick(e: MouseEvent) {
            this.clickService.handleClick(e);
        }
    }

One last thing I should note is that you also can do what you are attempting here without using the dynamic component stuff.  If the problem space is constrained and well defined you could potentially achieve what you are trying to do with a simple [ngSwitch](https://angular.io/api/common/NgSwitch), like:

    <container [ngSwitch]=""compType"">
      <component-1 *ngSwitchCase=""comp1"">...</component-1>
      <component-2 *ngSwitchCase=""comp2"">...</component-2>
    </<container>

And just recursively instantiate those containers as necessary according to the model passed.  This method works just fine, but can be a bit of a pain to modify as time goes on.  So if the item types that can be displayed won't change often then that can be a valid way to achieve your goal as well.  But if you are going to be adding new component types to display inside the tree regularly it is probably better to go the dynamic route.  There is more upfront boilerplate to write for the dynamic method but long term adding a new dynamic component is basically ""free"", just pass that new component type in through the model; no need to edit the template of the tree item component.   

That was a huge wall of text so I'm just going to stop there.  I'm sure you have questions so feel free to ask and I'll answer when I get a chance.  But this outlines the basic way you can do what you are trying to.",1530620835.0

mdeeswrath,"Hi, So I've  created your app in a stackblitz here :  [categories-app](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-xne72r) and my output is not exactly like yours. This is what  I get

    categories service loaded...
    initing categories array here...
    Retrieving categories from server...
    {categories: ""categories""}
    Retrieving categories for categories
    done?
    Angular is running in the development mode. Call enableProdMode() to enable the production mode.
    data
    HttpErrorResponse {headers: {…}, status: 200, statusText: ""OK"", url: ""https://angular-xne72r.stackblitz.io/undefinedcategories""…}

And to me this makes perfect sense.   Now i do get that http error there, because  the host is not defined in your example. But should  that url be correct you'd get back your values instead of  that error .

 Let me explain briefly how this works

When you load your app up, Angular will    check your app for the root module. Afterwards it will walk all the way trough the dependency tree and use the Angular compiler to compile the templates for all of your components. It will then look for your bootstrap component. Once it finds it , it will instantiate it. Since , in this example, the root component dependes on the  Categroies service, it will instantiate that too. As a result, the constructor gets called.  In the constructor, we have a call to the  **getAllCategories**  method. This method gets called and will use the HttpClient instance to make the requst. As we know,  the HttpClient returns an observable. You have to understand that this observable is cold. it will fire EVERY TIME someone subscribes to it. So do be careful  with that.  

so the cain of events would be as follows

    categories service loaded... // we are in the constructor
    initing categories array here... // sill in the constructor and our array is empty
    Retrieving categories from server... // this is right before we call our getAllCategories method
    {categories: ""categories""} // inside  getAllCategories 
    Retrieving categories for categories // right before we call the http client
    done ? //  well yes

so 'done' is called because we have an asynchronous operation here.  The call to 'subscribe' does not wait for the request to happen. That is not how observables or even promises work. The subscribe method is called when the observable emits.  In this case it will happen once the http-request will  completed (successfully or not). And since this is an asynchronous operation,  the code moves on, and you get the 'done' output

    Angular is running in the development mode. Call enableProdMode() to enable the production mode.

well, yes again. remember, we are still booting-up.  Your root component is not done initializing, we are still in its constructor. After the 'done' output, angular continues to do it's thing and finally , after booting up, it will notice that it is running in development mode

    data

 Yes!, our server finally responds and we get something back. The reason we see this is because we are  handling the error when we do this

     catchError(e => of(e))

here you're basically turning an error into a success

and  finally

    HttpErrorResponse {headers: {…}, status: 200, statusText: ""OK"", url: ""https://angular-xne72r.stackblitz.io/undefinedcategories""…}

because this is the erorr that we are getting back and that we have turned into a successful attempt

So. give it a go and  see  for yourself.  I hope this makes more sense now. If you can create  a sample of what it's unclear, maybe we can work trough it.",1530638804.0
Martinspire,"While shadowdom is great and all, it still feels like a solution to a problem that is not always applicable. If you have styling that relies on global settings or have to work with different labels/brands or different languages then you still need some higher up logic and inherited styling that shadow dom will block. It is nice if you want to use default building blocks and never have to rely on connected logic (like validation that is not limited to a single field or doesn't need rest calls) to do your thing, but in any major project its benefit will be marginal. Because if you need any part of this, it will require lots of code and markup that is duplicate from other shadow doms.

There will be times that you'll want to just subscribe to an observable immediately in ngOnInit and stop subscribing in ngOnDestroy, I'm doing it in more than a few places, but remember that if you have an observable as an input then all of your outputs can be expressed as observables as well. It creates very clean declarative code to use streams where every result is expressed as a combination of some inputs. You can often accomplish what you want by just piping the observable into some kind of map function, or by using Observable.combineLatest.

Also, don't forget to stop subscribing in ngOnDestroy! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38008334/angular-rxjs-when-should-i-unsubscribe-from-subscription

“Using an observable when possible” is not a good approach. You should use them if it makes sense. 

In your particular scenario, it probably doesn’t matter. Go with whatever makes most sense right now, change it up later if you need to. 

Personally, I don’t like maintaining state in components when possible, so linking to the source of observable data directly in the templates is usually my preferred approach. With that said, sometimes the component needs to access that observable data within some method defined in the component; in those cases, I always subscribe in ngOnInit and store the data locally for reading. 

You want to make sure you avoid subscribing to an observable from a method called from the template. That can have huge performance hit. Based on your description, doesn’t sound like that was even a consideration. ",1530463957.0
tme321,">Does importing the child component go against the principle of unit testing in that you want to isolate each component?

Yes.  The point of unit testing is to verify that a single piece of functionality, in this case a component, works according to its spec.  The point is to isolate a single piece of code and only verify that piece.  That's why you stub everything else out; so you can determine that the right stubbed out code was called when it was supposed to be without having to also test the behaviour of the full unstubbed code.

tme321,"Zip will take an array of observables and wait till they all emit before emitting.  Combine latest is similar.  The main difference between the 2 is zip will emit once all the source observables have emitted at least once and then will only emit again when all the observables have emitted a 2nd, or more, time.  Combine latest will wait till all the source observables have emitted at least once to emit but then each time any of the source observables emit again combine latest will reemit with the latest version of each observable.

Basically zip makes all the observables emit again before it emits.  Combine latest emits again each time any of the sources emit.

So let's say your initial source that emits an array looks something like:

    const array$ = http.get<{ id: number }[]>();

Then you can map that to an array of further http calls:

    const arrayOfObs$ = array$.pipe(
        map((res:{ id: number }[])=>
            res.map(item=>
                http.get('api.example.com/foo/' + item.id)))
    );

So then you can feed that into a zip:

    const allResults$ = arrayOfObs$.pipe(
        zip())

And then if you subscribe to allResults$ you will see an array of the http results (once they all complete).

You can combine these steps into one long pipe I just broke it up here to try to show what was happening.

\- ItemsManager (your container/smart/stateful component),

\- ItemsList (presentational/dumb/stateless component),

    <app-update-form *ngIf=""item"" (cancel)=""onCancel()"" (update)=""onUpdate()""  [item]=""item""></app-update-form>

- At the base, the foundation, you have unit tests, which ought to only check one method at a time *in isolation*

- In the middle, you have integration testing (confirm interactions between methods work)

- At the top, you'll have _e2e_ (end to end) tests which should check app's behavior in the browser -- as a user would interact with the app (test cases / user story)

The pyramid imagery suggests you should have more unit tests than e2e tests.

In my work project we have 100% code coverage with unit tests, and every method we write requires unit tests.

The good news is that it's often easy -- if a method that outputs a boolean when called can be easily tested with

        expect(component.methodA()).toBe(true);
      });
    });

The  bad news is it can take several weeks to finally figure out how to do more complicated things.

A lot of times you'll have a jasmine spy that will mock a return value from somewhere else. So if *methodA* uses some service, you'll inject the service (possibly running in a *fakeAsync*, spy on some method in it, and return a mock response.

    it('should do stuff ...', inject([ApiService], fakeAsync((apiService) => {
      spyOn(apiService, 'someMethod').and.returnValue({lol: 'hi'});
      ...
    })));

You'll likely want a test that just checks that when *methodA* is called, the *apiService.someMethod*is called. No need to test any logic inside the *someMethod* here -- all that should be checked by unit tests for *someMethod* written in the *apiService.spec* file.

In your case you'll probably want to write serveral tests, in each inject the *httpService*, spyOn the *getData* and mock a response (once, an *error*, in another test a success, etc).",1530272835.0

      dashboardComponent.getUsers();
      expect(httpService.getData().toHaveBeenCalled();

I think this is a sensible test -- it makes sure that *getData()* calls your *httpService*.

Generally you'll have a pattern where *describe* names a method, and all the *it* statements start with ""should"". So:

    describe('getUsers()', () => {

Finrojo,"I struggled for ages to find a decent lightweight modal solution and in the end I went with my own concoction. I'm sure there are much better ways to go about it but this is what I do.

I have a modelService.ts file which holds a single object of the modals I want to use in the application. All begin as false and are part of a BehaviourSubject that can be observed from any single component.ts file.

I then create each modal as a component and send the data in via a @Input() and then emit the result (i.e dismiss, updated, success or whatever) and handle the processing back in the calling component.

Ideally the modal component are placed in app.ts but I also place them in other components if required. This usually depends on whether or not I use state management.

for my modalService.ts....

Setup modals as a behaviourSubject

modals: {

customerDeleteConfirmation: false,

updateCustomer: false

}

toggleModal(modal) {

if (this.modals\[modal\]) {

this.modals\[modal\] = false;

} else {

 this.modal = true

}

customer.component.ts....

modals$: Observable<any>;

ngOnInit() {

this.modals$ = this.modalService.modals$;

}

updateCustomer(customer) {

  this.customerToAmend = customer;

  this.modalService.toggle('updateCustomer')

}

someCloseFunction(event) {

this.modalService.toggle('updateCustomer')

if (event.didUpdate) {

//call your service to handle the updated data to the api or store.

   }

}

customer.component.html.....

< normal html code to list out customers etc>

<p \*ngFor=""let customer of customers"">

  <a (onclick)=""updateCustomer(customer)"">\[edit\]</a>

  {{[customer.name](https://customer.name)}}

</p>

<app-customer-update-modal \*ngIf=""(modals$ | async).updateCustomer"" \[input\]=""customer"" (modalClose)=""someCloseFunction($event)""></app-customer-update-modal>

customerUpdateModal.ts....

@Input() customer;

@Output() modalClose = new EventEmitter;

save() {

const dataToSend = {

customer = this.customer,

didUpdate = true

}

this.modalClose.emit(dataToSend)

}

dismiss() {

const dataToSend = {

didUpdate = false

}

this.modalClose.emit(dataToSend)

}

app-customer-update-modal then simply has the CSS to make it appear as a modal on top of the current page. I also set a body-freeze class on the main <body> to stop background scrolling and apply a dark backdrop.

coopaliscious,"I have, in moments of insanity, while using a less than helpful back end, built in the concept of persistence into my models via inheritance such that there is a committed and a changed state for each attribute with a commit and reset function available on them. The getters all return the current state (changed values when changes are present). A getter for changes recursively returns changes for all attributes and child models. This allowed me to make all the silly calls that I needed to meet the requirements of what I was working on.

That was a special case for a special system, but I did enjoy being able to track unpersisted changes in a very concise way outside of dealing with the angular form object and depending on the form state for change detection.

Angular has improved a bunch since then, and change detection may be better now, but it was really useful for clueing users in on what had and had not yet been persisted.

All of that is really to say, whichever way you choose to apply your saves, just make it abundantly clear to the user what to expect.

In financial and inventory systems the people I've dealt with really enjoy explicit saves and undos. In areas where things are less exacting and changes being persisted don't really impact anything outside of the model being worked on, do what's easiest for the user.",1530068163.0

tme321,">Should I have a separate component for the navigation bar header as well as the footer, 

Absolutely.  Don't make an entire page or view inside a single component.  A component should be a well defined piece of functionality, not an entire page.

It's hard to define exactly how much to break components down but it comes with practice.  In general I'd say that if you find yourself making an individual image, or button, or link into it's own separate component most likely you've gone too far in breaking things up.  But I'm sure there are valid cases for even that level of granularity.

>and the main component is just a series of router-outlets?

Sort of?  My app component templates usually end up looking something like:

    <nav-bar></>
    <router-outlet></>
    <footer-bar></>

So not just router outlets but yes often they contain the broadest layout elements necessary with a router outlet positioned inside of them.

For components you'll want to at least understand the concept of smart/functional vs dumb/presentational components.  The basic idea is that you can use a single top level component, for a particular piece of functionality, that takes care of the actual logic needed and then breaks up the job of displaying the data into child components who only take data in through @Inputs and report events back to the parent with @Outputs but internally contain no logic of their own.

A simple example could be a calendar.  You could have a CalendarComponent that is the top level functional parent component.  It might take in a date to start the view of the calendar on.  And it might have outputs to notify listeners of things like when a day is clicked.

But the CalendarComponent doesn't display the individual day boxes.  Instead each day is represented by a DayComponent where each one gets passed a single DayModel from the CalendarComponent and the only thing the DayComponents do is emit an event when clicked that the CalendarComponent is listening for.

That way you break up the functionality into more discrete chunks but most of the chunks are very simple; displaying data in and signaling events out.

Of course you can take this idea even further with the dependency injection system.  But apparently there are people on this sub that can't stand the thought [of that design](https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/8qowjo/comment/e0mp83u). :P",1529879631.0

tme321,"You can either organize where the router outlets are in relation to the rest of the content or you can use [secondary routes](https://angular.io/guide/router#secondary-routes).

For the first choice say you have a map url where you are displaying a map and have a side menu.  Basically you describe the route as something like this:

    { path: ""map/:id"", component: MapLayoutComponent }

So then MapLayoutComponent might have a template that looks something like:

    <div>
        <sidebar><router-outlet></></>
        <map></>
    </div>

So here I'm embedding the router outlet inside the sidebar.  Then in order to change What's in the sidebar you can define that inside child routes of the map route:

    { path: ""map/:id"", component: MapLayoutComponent,
        children: [
            { path: """", component: ListViewComponent },
            { path: ""details"", component: DetailsViewComponent }       
        ] }

Then when the user is on /map/123 the route inside is bound to the sidebar's content and displays the ListView and if they somehow navigate to /map/123/details the DetailsView will be shown instead inside the sidebar.

The second option using secondary routes is the same basic idea just using a secondary route so that the main routing actions of the url can be used for other things, say in case the main url is being used to control the map itself.  But fundamentally it's the same basic idea.",1529587057.0

dryadofelysium,"## Highlights

* Angular 6 support  
Clarity has updated to run with Angular 6 and Rxjs 6 without the need for the rxjs-compat layer. The 0.12 release is only certified to work with Angular 6 and above.
* Support for Angular CLI ng add  
Clarity can now be installed using Angular CLI v6+ by simply running the following: ng add @clr/angular  
. You can use this with any Angular CLI project, even if you've already started to work on it.
* Redesigned Forms  
Forms have been redesigned for better usability and developer experience. Currently they are only fully supported in @clr/ui, but new Angular components will be arriving during 0.12 for important form controls like inputs, passwords, and selects.
* New Spinner Button  
A new type of button is now available, that allows you to set the button to a spinner while an asynchronous event occurs (such as saving or loading). You can read more about the details here [1488](https://github.com/vmware/clarity/issues/1488) and updated documentation can be found [here](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/documentation/v0.12/buttons) under the Loading Buttons section.
* Refreshed Grid  
Our previous grid had some limitations and was based off Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.5. The new grid comes prefixed with clr-  
 so it doesn't conflict with other grid libraries and gives us better control. Another advantage is it will allow us to solve a number of issues with popover clipping (due to position: relative) with the old grid. Refer to our [documentation](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/documentation/v0.12/grid) for more details.
* Input and form control validation components  
Angular input form control, which has built in validation support for template-driven or reactive forms. This is the first of the upcoming Angular form controls.
* Shape deprecations in Clarity Icons  
Clarity Icons v0.12 has deprecated some icons in their respective sets and moved to other sets:  

   * wand  
 has been moved to ""essential-shapes"" from ""media-shapes""
   * angle-double  
 has been moved to ""core-shapes"" from ""essential-shapes""
   * calendar  
 and event  
 have been moved to ""core-shapes"" from ""social-shapes""
   * bar-chart  
 and line-chart  
 have been moved to ""chart-shapes"" from ""technology-shapes""

## Deprecations

To move forward, this release comes with a number of deprecations that will be removed in future versions of Clarity. You should not use these features in new development, and plan for rewriting where necessary.

* **Code Highlight** will be removed, so if you happen to use it you may copy our implementation into your codebase or find an alternative that suits your needs.
* **Wizard Ghost Pages** will be removed, which this is an undocumented feature that we're removing.

We also revamped our internal build tooling to better align with Angular's tools. Some of the early betas were published just to test functionality, and this was the first real beta.

## Bug Fixes

* Updated paths for theme SCSS files so developers can again use custom themes. Apps must now add --include-path=node\_modules  
 to their SCSS build step to correctly build a custom theme. See Themes documentation for more details. ([\#2336](https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2336))
* Fixed an issue where the Date Picker Output was not emitted when the user modified the Date Input manually.([\#2334](https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2334))",1529519803.0

also, try putting ""\*ngIf = data"" on the parent of this component, so the html will render only after ""data"" is not undefined.let me know if it helped.

(Reusing logic) Also the temptation to store state in services becomes a thing. I worked on a project where the developer stored and mutated little copies of the store in services. It was a nightmare. 

2.) Again it depends. That article presents a bit of a straw man. Those problems can be solved with RxJs, so I really don't think ""never do http in effects"" is warranted. 

3.) Partially agree here. I'm quite guilty of this myself. However the benefits of selectors outweigh the boilerplate cost imho.",1528867511.0
tme321,"1.  I absolutely agree.  I've tried many times to explain why I still use injectable services to act as an interface layer between the store and the components with various levels of success.  But I've found that adhering to a pattern where components never directly touch the store simplifies things like refactoring later on and keeps the components themselves easy to test and reason about.  A lot of developers are on board the functional / presentational components pattern but I take it one step further and abstract *almost* all logic out of the components themselves.

2.  I'm not completely convinced on this one.  The article brings up a lot of valid points but in the end it has a lot to do with how you organize the rest of the app.  I can definitely see the argument.  And maybe standardizing on not firing http requests inside an effect would make it harder to mess things up.  But there are certainly other ways to achieve the same effect.

3.  Yes, if you find yourself manually toggling individual pieces of state constantly then your actions probably don't map to higher level functionality but instead are just being used in lieu of direct object access.  This is almost as bad as setups that have to fire multiple actions at once rather than having multiple reducers listen for the same action.  Both are anti patterns that are the result of not properly understanding the point of ngrx and similar libraries.

lars_jeppesen,"1) The Store actually is a service afaik... so injecting the store into your component is just fine. We're using the classic smart (containers) /dumb (presentational) component structure, and only the smart components touch the store. Presentational components never ever touch the store, but only get and send data via input/outputs.

2) We use an ""API"" service created to wrap http requests. This way we can globally handle errors, trigger ""pending"" states in the store, etc. The API service can also handle things like injecting security tokens, language headers and so on, into all requests. Individual services/effects never call ""@angular/http"", they use our API wrapper. We don't create special services for each type of http request.. .. mutation of data from http endpoints are done in effects, most of the time.

AbstractLogic,"I have three suggestions that may help you.

First suggestion: To store a response to check against later you can create a root Service. This is a singleton and will be alive for the duration of your users experience. 

    @Injectable()
    export class LocalDataStoreService {
        public users: User[];
    }

 Second suggestion: Instead of using a service to store the data. Use the browsers session. This has the additional value of staying alive so long as the browser is open. (Ie if they hit f5 and reload your website it is still there).


    @Injectable()
    export class Session {
        private storage = sessionStorage;

        get users(): Users[] {
            return <Users[] >JSON.parse(this.storage.getItem('Users'));
        }

       set users(data:  Users[] ) {
            this.storage.setItem('Users', JSON.stringify(data));
       }
    }

Third Suggestion: This is a totally different solution! Instead of calling the server 50 times. Call it once. Pass in a list of UserId[] and have it return a list of User[]. This will significantly reduce the strain on your server. This is the solution I would go for first if you have performance issues. Caching data (session, service from above) can get tricky since you have to answer questions like 'when do I refresh the cache' and 'when does data get removed from cache automatically'.

,"Aight I'm going to do a top level comment with a full explanation. When I tested the example again, when one select value changed, it was changing other selects too even though the array was functioning properly. This lead me to beilieve that angular was having trouble tracking values in the array.

Therefore, I provided a track by function for angular. New ngFor, sorry i'm not used to templates, just used a div

    <div *ngFor=""let t of contactTypes; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn"">

I made an update to the binding of the select box, although this might be unnecessary, it's good pattern to perform side effects on select box change.

    <mat-select name=""{{i}}"" [ngModel]=""contactTypes[i]"" 
     (ngModelChange)=""contactTypes[i] = $event"" placeholder=""Contact type"">

Full code including track by function is here.

Saying that primitive types are not change detectable is a pretty big statement, and brings into question the usefulness of the framework. I don't believe it to be true in any way. After all, objects are just wrappers around primitives.

Also, according to u/talleane, angular runs change detection on the entire DOM on each triggered event, therefore this is not a good pattern in terms of performance. Instead use OnPush change detection.

tme321,"I would create an observable stream with 2 inputs where 1 is the data source and another is an array of selected filter functions.  You can use combine latest to get a new data set any time either input is changed.  Personally I would probably cache the http result inside of a service, or even a state store if you are using one, but you can just use the share operator instead if you want to make the stream directly from the http call.

Then inside the combine latest mapping function you can do some sort of reduce on the array of filter functions and apply each one to the source data and the final output can be the result.

A very rough sketch:

    filterFunctions = [];
    filterFunctions$ = new BehaviourSubject(filterFunctions);

    return combineLatest(
        this.http.get(...).pipe(share()),
        filterFunctions$,

Then any time you want to add or remove a filter function you can just do something like

    this.filterFunctions.push(newFilter);
    this.filterFunctions$.next([...this.filterFunctions]);

You could probably instead use a reduce rxjs operator on the filterFunctions$ subject where you send it into the combine latest operator and not have to cache the filterFunctions array in order to manipulate it, basically same as above but:

    combineLatest(
        this.http...,
        this.filterFunctions$.pipe(reduce(...)),

But do you mean you can read the id passed from the component? Or do you mean you can read the result in the mapping?  
Can you read res in your component?
In your expressjs route, does it read the id or gives you 'undefined'?

When you post, try using one string - I once had an issue where the string formatting was causing problems and I couldn't understand why.

    return this.httpClient.post('http://localhost:3000/item/' + id)

or

    return this.httpClient.post(`http://localhost:3000/item/${id}`)

    };
    
    return this.httpClient.post(`http://localhost:3000/item/${id}`,null,  httpOptions)


edit:
2. Are you properly declaring your routes in app.js?
ie. 
your url is http.../item/:id

check that you have:

    let item = require('./routes/item'); // app.js again or wherever the entry point is - assuming you used express- 
        generator.

then later in the file (before the 404 part):

jason_gates,"Hi,

TS \(.ts\) files are ""typescript"" source files. Your web browser does not run the typescript source files. The web browser runs .js \(javascript\) files. Angular uses a ""transpiler""  to convert your typescript source files to javascript files.

Typically, the typescript source files are located in one location, the \(transpiler output\) javascript files are located in a different location. Your issue, is most likely, where the transpiler output location is set.

A typical angular project uses the angular/cli to ""transpile"" \(AKA build\)  your angular app. Please note! It is possible that the ""partially completed project"" does not use angular/cli. For purposes of this comment, let's assume you are using angular/cli. The default transpiler output setting is the ""dist"" directory. The easiest way to override \(the default output setting\) and test is to run the following command line \(from you angular project root, where the package.json is located\):

$\> ng build \-\-output\-path ../DESIRED\_DIRECTORY\_LOCATION

You might want to test the command out by setting DESIRED\_DIRECTORY\_LOCATION to some temporary test location \(E.G. temp\_test\_dir\)

Check the file system and verify the command line \(ng build .....\) worked. There should be an index.html file along with a series of js files \(E.G. main.bundle.js in the temp\_test\_dir directory\).

Once you master the location setting, set it to the correct IIS location.

benduder,"`Renderer3` is codenamed Ivy and is still in development (it is not feature complete yet), hence its lack of documentation.

`Renderer` (v1) is deprecated.

You're right that the official way of doing things seems to be moving away from `Renderer2`, supposedly because the introduction of Domino on the server-side means that the base rendering environment is similar enough across all platforms that there is no longer any need to add a layer of indirection/abstraction over that. But I am struggling to find any official documentation that says as much, besides the PR you found.

Edit: [here is an issue](https://github.com/fgnass/domino/issues/100) on Domino that adds a bit more colour (vikerman is a member of the core Angular team):

> In Angular we currently have an interface through which Angular manipulates the DOM (on server and browser). We want to get rid of this and just use a DOM API on both server and browser. This would also let our users bring in third party libraries to work more seamlessly on the server.

> I am prototyping a domino backed DOM implementation for Angular on the server since I found domino to provide good performance while providing the set of DOM APIs that we need.

So it does seem that silently the recommended approach has become to ignore `Renderer2` completely. But I would wait for someone more confident about this to agree before you nuke it from your codebase :)

rocketbunny77,"I personally don't like Observables for things that HAVE to be populated for the application to function, and only ever 'execute' once in the lifecycle. , Those values could be 'injected' into the application at the start of the bootstrap process, like you have said. 

I work on a production application that has some environmental config on the server that needs to be populated at run time on the client side. It is _required_ to be there for the application to function. It's transferred to the client side via Transfer State. For the implementation, I had the option of using:

1. Observables to execute the get from the Transfer state

2. Use the Transfer State everywhere

3. Grab the values from the state at the bootstrap stage and inject them into the app



I went with the third option.

The result is much cleaner code, that keeps the actual population of the variables hidden to the application. (Even if the population just appears to be _go get my variable and tell me what it  is when you're done_). Accessing a variable without having to write code to subscribe to it feels like it makes much more sense, and makes handling application flow a lot cleaner.

Any time you need to pass data between components, using a service is your best bet.

u6z2,"You got it right, it's a synchronizing issue - the `.get()` is being called and then right afterwards, the outer `console.log()` has nothing to log since the subscription hasn't resolved at that time. The most 'angular' way of fixing this is to have your service return observables from it's methods. [Here's a stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ggprys) showing a basic working example of how an API call would be implemented in a service. Things to note:

- The service methods return a type of `Observable<any>`. Preferably, `any` is not used and should be replaced with an Interface type, allowing for strong typing throughout. 
- We don't explicitly call `.subscribe()` - we let the [async pipe](https://angular.io/api/common/AsyncPipe) do the subscribing (and unsubscribing) for us. You can call `.subscribe()` on the `.getOutput()`'s return value if needed, but it's usually best to try and use the async pipe when possible in combination with rxjs operators if needed.
- This model makes your service more reusable (and testable!) and allows the methods to be called without actually initiating an HTTP request until the data is needed/subscribed to. You can observe this by commenting out the line with the async pipe in the template - without this, the HTTP request isn't performed, as the data isn't 'needed' by anything.",1526864953.0
LdouceT,"    getOutput(): any {
      this.http.get('APICall').subscribe(data => {
        console.log(data); \\ this works just fine I can see the JSON object in the console.
        this.output = data;
      });

      console.log(this.output); //This DOES NOT WORK, I get an undefined object.
      return this.output;
  }

You are right when you say it's a synchronization issue - asynchronous programming takes a little while to get used to. If you call getOutput, you should see the following.

  \> undefined

  *http call completes after some amount of time*

  \> data

Basically what is happening here is this.

      this.http.get('APICall').subscribe(data => {
        console.log(data); \\ this works just fine I can see the JSON object in the console.
        this.output = data;
      });

This block is basically saying ""initiate the http call, and listen for the response."" So while your subscription is listening, the rest of the function continues to run. Only once the http request completes, the observable will emit the value and the subscription callback will fire. The key here is that some time goes by before your callback is invoked, so your console.log(this.output) that is below this block runs **before** the http call is completed. Your function can't return data synchronously since the data is fetched asynchronously.

You have a couple of options here.

**Option 1** you can have your function return the observable. Then you can subscribe to the function in your component.

    getOutput(): any {
      return this.http.get('APICall')
    }

And then in your component,

    this.service.getOutput().subscribe(data => console.log(data));

**Option 2** I prefer to set up my data services this way.

    export class MyService {

      // private BehaviorSubject for storing and pushing new data
      private output: BehaviorSubject<any> = new BehaviorSubject<any>;

      // Expose the this.output as an Observable, basically stripping away the ability to write to it from outside your service
      readonly output$ = this.output.asObservable();

      constructor(private http: HttpClient) {
         // Get the output when the service is constructed - ie initialize the data
         this.getOutput();
      }

      getOutput(): any {
        // execute the API call whenever we want to fetch the data
        this.http.get('APICall').subscribe(data => this.output.next(data) );
      }
    }

Now, from your components, you can just subscribe to MyService.output$ so you always get the most recent data whenever getOutput() is called and the http call completes. You can also trigger the data to update, which will trigger your subscription callback to fire again as well.

    export class MyComponent implements OnInit {

      constructor(private myService: MyService) {}

      ngOnInit() {
        this.myService.output$
          .subscribe(data => do stuff with the data);
      }

      // any time you want to refresh the data, just call this

        this.myService.getOutput();

Another mistake you are doing is to share variables and theme. If the theme creates code, you will import the file probably into components in order to use the variables. Doing that you'll import the theme over and over again.

jason_gates,"Hi,
I would consider analysing how you project's data is going to be used first. For example, data on the server may be used differently than on the frontend (E.G. Angular app).

Once you have an inventory of how your data is going be used on the frontend, then model the data after your specific application needs. Don't choose some library first, then try to shoe horn your application's needs to match the library.

For example, one the server, your data may be stored in a relational database. You might have a separate data table for ""Persons"", ""Interests"", and finally a ""many-to-many' table, ""PersonInterests"". Your frontend may always require a Person and all of their ""interests"". Your frontend may never need a list of ""interests"", independent of a Person. So when the server delivers Person data to the frontend, each person contains an array of interests (the array could be zero to many interests).

To summarize, you application business requirements should be prominent in you data structure planning.

jason_gates,"Hi,
Yes, you can use a server app to relay http requests and responses. Both node express and java tomcat applications can relay (I.E. make) http requests to other servers.

The flow would be: angular app talks to the relay server. The relay server makes requests to your web service. The relay server sends the service response back to the angular app.

That is a common architecture for enterprise applications. You have a relay server that the public can access. Then you have other servers (such as your service) that are protected behind a firewall.

For more details, I would find a different forum. The changes you are looking for are ""backend"" changes. This forum is for a frontend framework. Front-end developers tend not understand network topology and/or server message distributions.

tme321,"The webasm group has been saying from the very beginning that the point of webasm isn't to replace js but to work with it.

Personally I think those statements aren't worth the bits they are stored on because eventually *someone* will make pure webasm frameworks whether it's members of the webasm committee or not.

But I'm not entirely sure what this has to do with angular at the moment.  The renderer is an implementation detail that I don't think should matter to app developers.  I don't care if my code is using a virtual dom like react or some sort of dom graph like angular does.  I don't even care if the renderer my code is using is the fastest.  I just care that it is fast enough that it doesn't cause my application to slow down.

I'm not really seeing angular morphing into a webasm framework unless it's just under the hood details that I won't work directly with anyway so don't care about.  I *would* be worried about Google going crazy and deciding another full rewrite of Angular was necessary for this webasm framework future.  

I personally don't have a big problem picking up yet another framework.  Once you've figured out a few application frameworks you start seeing large similarities and only have to learn the smaller surface area of differences.  But the overall community will move away from angular harder than they already have if Google makes a similar mistake twice in such a short timeframe.  And I won't feel a desire to spend much time on a sinking ship.

So right now I don't see what webasm is supposed to offer me as a developer using angular.  Maybe in the near future that will allow me to pull in webasm code and seamlessly integrate it with angular.  That's cool, but hardly deal breaking either way.

In my opinion WA is still overhyped. I've done Qt \(with PyQt\) and WPF \(C#\) before. Would I prefer those frameworks to build webapps with? No. Html, CSS, JS was very hard to learn, but is much more powerful then the desktop UI frameworks. Would I prefer another language over TS? The only one that interests me would be Kotlin. Would I use C\+\+\`? Never!

Too me, two main bullet points remain on the pro side of WA:

* reusing a given code base \(C/C\+\+, e.g. Unreal or Unity3D or SQLite\)
* Multithreading \(once WA does support it\)

tme321,"Providing a concrete example with actual code would help in giving you an answer.  But for what you've written above:

>do I need to make a middle layer which is responsible for converting a model into a state and at that point, enter Redux?

It depends.  Do you need the original config, possibly to make changes to it and save it back to the server?  If so I think the config is part of your state even if you don't.  

If the config is read on init and then can be discarded because it will never be used again then yes you can make some sort of layer to convert it.

If the config is needed again later *and* you need to derive something from it you can use a single action with multiple reducers reading that action.  One reducer might just store the config for later.  Another might accept the config and derive the state you need.

>It seems if I don't do that I'm gonna have a single reducer which globally converts everything, an maybe that is normal?

Yes and no.  Mostly no.  Technically your entire store operates on a single reducer.  That's why you add all the entries to an object like

    {
        Key1: Reducer1,
        Key2: Reducer2 
    }

However that is really an implementation detail.  *You* should treat each reducer as a separate set of logic for a particular chunk of the state.

I'm not really sure what you mean by globally convert everything.  Redux is a single store state, so any part of the store you change is changed globally in that sense.

But if you mean some sort of store where every piece of state is under a single key with a single reducer absolutely not.

beeman_nl,"It's described briefly [here in the official wiki](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-multiple-projects), and it's actually this simple.

Inside your existing Angular 6 project you can run `ng generate application new-app` and it will create that new app for you in the `projects` folder of your workspace.

Now in order to run this new app, you use `ng serve new-app`. If you want to run it next to another project you will need to specify the port in the `ng serve` command, like this `--port 4201`.

Since version 6 you can also specify the port for your apps in the `angular.json` file. Open the file and find the property:
 `projects`.`new-app`.`architect`.`serve`.`options` and add:

```
""port"": 4201
```


For libraries it's [very similar](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-create-library). The following command will create a library in the `projects/my-lib` directory :

```
ng generate library my-lib
```

The library can now be used in the other projects or libraries, can can even be published on NPM. Please note that the libraries currently can't be built in watch mode by the Angular CLI, you manually have to rebuild after changes or [use the workaround I posted here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/10643#issuecomment-386736890).

jason_gates,"Hi, I recommend a different approach. I would re-frame your issue as ""sharing data between components"". 

One solution is, create an injectable service. Move the agency data from your components, to the service. Next inject the service into each component that needs the shared agency data. 

In addition, you can add a data property to your service. The new data property stores the current selected agency location. That way each component can get (and/or set) the selected agency location from the service.

To summarize, the service allows you to store the data in one place and then allows multiple components to share (and/or update) the data.

I recommend a different approach. 

Currently you are using 2 web servers (spring boot and angular/webpack/devserver). I recommend using just one of those servers, spring boot). In other words eliminate the CORS/Crossorigin/Proxy configuration. Replace with a single web server (spring boot). 

For your spring boot app, you need to either locate and/or create a ""src/main/resources"" directory.

For your angular app, use ""ng build"" instead of ""ng serve"". Your current angular/cli configuration builds your angular app in the ""dist"" subdirectory. After your angular app is built (I.E. ""ng build""), locate the ""dist"" directory.

Copy the contents of the ""dist"" directory (including the ""index.html"") file to the spring boot ""src/main/resources"" directory. Rebuild and restart your spring boot app. Use your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/.

What are you trying to accomplish?",1525454395.0
tme321,"I am currently undecided as to whether these are deal breakers for future apps but I have 2 main concerns currently with ngxs.

1.  Minor, but I don't like how **every single** observable I return from inside a mutator function uses the tap operator to then do something else.  I understand why it ends up working that way but I feel like there could be some better setups.  Maybe with additional decorators or even ngxs specific observable operators.  Like instead of

    @Action(SomeAction)
    onSomeAction(...) {
        return this.http.get(...).pipe(
            tap(res=>
                dispatch(new OtherAction(res)));
    }

I think it would be more semantic and feel better to be able to write something like:

    @Action(SomeAction)
    onSomeAction(...) {
        return this.http.get(...).pipe(
            dispatch(res=>new OtherAction(res)))
    }

That's just an example mind you.  But it feels goofy to *always* use tap on **every single** observable stream I return.

2.  The bigger issue:  I feel like ngxs is a much bigger footgun than ngrx.  Since mutator functions are unconstrained on what they can do compared to the simplicity of a redux reducer I'm not sure how well ngxs would work with a large team.  

I've had a good experience using it on a side project but I'm worried what will happen when junior devs are put in front of it and figure out that they can literally do anything they want inside a mutators.  

Maybe if we had some alternate form of @Action that instead described a function with no side effects that explicitly returned the next state ala redux I would feel more comfortable about it.  

But as it stands right now ngxs feels like one of those tools that can do amazing things in a simpler form than ngrx *but* it can also be abused to do horrible things and cause all kinds of issues.

Don't do this.

The better approach would be to try and think about why you are returning HTML from the API? Is it because the backend service only knows about certain data? What if you converted this data to a more consumable format, like JSON?

If you could reason with what the HTML is supposed to represent, and then convert it to JSON, you could then construct Component's on the front end using the Dynamic Component Loader (https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-component-loader).

So, for example, let's say your JSON response was something like:

    {
      ""div"": ""content for div"",
    }

Then you could take this response and know to construct a div component, with the content for div inside of it. Which is a simple enough ng-content Component.

But, the hard part is going to be reasoning with this API, and figuring out what it's trying to represent, instead of just the raw HTML.

Rizens,">  all data needs to be new'd up as part of a class? 

This type of code design is not about ""embracing typescript"" it's about code linting.

Typescript is a super-set of JS so you should use everything that's in JS as long as it doesn't conflict with TS.

The usage of 'New' for everything is up to your team by creating a specific code linting (.eslinrc if i'm not mistaken) to assert that every data declaration is using 'new' or using object literal , but it should be only one of the two , and if there is an exception for the usage it should be specified and everyone in the team should have the info.

I would personally recommend to always do a class for everything. This is just my personal preference , I think this is much more straighforward to read `new User()` than `{ name : 'joe' , age 20 , ... }`, hence the fact that as the project grow , it's very likely that this user will have some logic that is proper to him. Because you'd have already isolated him in a class all you'll have to do is to declare some methods to him, if needed we'll be able to declare it as an interface or to make it extends for others subclass ( but you should prefer interface obviously for performance as they don't generate actual code).

Making everything a class has it's perks, but if you get larger and larger constructors, it becomes harder to maintain the app. A healthy mix of `types` and `classes` will make it easy to maintain and keep your typesafety at a decent level.
Per example:

```
export type ProductType = { category: string, selected?: false, icon?: string }
export class Product {
    constructor(readonly id: string, readonly name: string, readonly obj: ProductType) {}

// Further product logic

The CLI hides all of this for you while also giving you really handy schematics for generation. Plus, and I think this is crucial, it abstracts away the build platform so that if the Angular team decides to move away from Webpack in the future, you don't have to make any changes on your end.

Definitely not recommended for a real app. You'd be better off finding something that can function as a SOAP client inside your Angular app, but like I said above I didn't find a lot of slam dunks a while back.

If you're lucky enough to control the enterprise service, your best bet is to actually create a separate rest endpoint on top of the API itself. In both the Java and .Net worlds most modern frameworks allow you to make a REST endpoint with relatively simple annotation or configuration changes.

If you're just playing to get started, I'd suggest either finding a more welcoming  REST endpoint or hacking together your own adapter in the enterprisey language of your choice (sounds like .Net here).

julianooi,"Not the best with explanations, but here's off the top of the dome piece.

Rxjs is an implementation of the observable pattern. The observable pattern consists of 2 parts, the *Observable* part, and the *Observer* part.

*Observables* can be created using a slew of functions, as can be referenced from here https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/creation/. On that note, *subjects* are also *observables*.

*Observers* on the other hand, are mainly from a subscription (which are created by calling subscribe on an *observable*).

As for hot / cold / warm observables, I only know hot / cold, so i'll do my best to explain them.

* Hot - an observable which emits values no matter if there's an observer or not. 
**Example**: if a web page's DOM's events were implemented using rxjs, they would be sources of hot observables, because events are emitted no matter if there's someone observing it or not.
* Cold - an observable which executes the creation function each time it is subscribed to. Does nothing if nobody subscribes to it. Executes the creation function as many times as it is subscribed to. 
**Example**: a http request observable, which does nothing until it is subscribed to.

As for operators, i'm only really familiar with 2 operators, please do refer to https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/ or hit me up if you would like to know more.

* pipe - Takes a source observable and executes the provided operators sequentially, taking the output of the previous operator, and passing it into the next.
* map - Takes an input and transforms it into a different output. **Example**: Given a source of apples, *map* it to its color (Thus becoming an observable of apple's colors).

>Ideally, I'd like to just fire up my WebAPI project in VS and then point my browser to localhost and poke around with the results. Is this still possible?

Not really sure what you are asking here.  The api is a completely separate project so yes you can start the api however you would like.  As long as it's accepting connections it will work just fine.

The cli includes a development mode, ng  serve, you start that command and it creates a light weight server that by default serves on port 4200 so then you just go to localhost:4200.  The port is configurable if needed.

The dev mode supports hot reloading so as you make changes it recompiled and reloads the site.  It's not completely instant like it might be with angularjs since there is a compile step of ts to js.  But it's pretty short and I've never had issues with it.

>I guess I just like to keep my toolchain as short as possible, ie. VS.

This is just my opinion but vs sucks for front end development.  C#?  It's great and I'll use VS all day.  Front end?  Vscode is much better.

Having said that you can just open a command line and run ng serve in the background and still use vs for the file editing.

I recommend a different approach. I would re-frame your issue as ""sharing data between components"".

theadammorganshow,"Hey there! Last year I quit my job to work full-time on a project I had been thinking about for some time - writing a book to teach front-end development using the Angular framework. I had previously written [similar](https://scotch.io/tutorials/testing-angularjs-with-jasmine-and-karma-part-1) [material](https://scotch.io/tutorials/testing-angularjs-with-jasmine-and-karma-part-2) for the website Scotch.io covering automated testing using the the AngularJS framework. Given the great feedback I received, I decided to write a book for Angular.

My book, The Angular Tutorial, teaches you how to develop, test, and deploy a modern front-end web application with an approach that simulates how a front-end developer would use Angular on the job. Many tutorials cut corners on specific concepts or features within a web framework which leave gaps between what is learned and what a developer can expect on the job. In The Angular Tutorial, you’ll be introduced to Angular in a way that’s as “real world” as possible.

In other books, interacting with a real API and database is often skipped with hard-coded values used as a substitute. Topics such as automated testing are usually skipped entirely. In The Angular Tutorial, you’ll be provided an API that you’ll setup just as you would as a front-end developer in a real job. Throughout the rest of the book you’ll then learn how to read the API’s documentation, creating and deploying a fully tested Angular application that interacts with a real database and API.

I got into more detail about the book and the overall process taken within the book in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZDeN3Amm30). If you have any questions about the book, I'd be happy to answer them.

You should avoid injecting and manipulating element refs directly unless you have *no other means* to do what you want.

In this case adding a state Boolean to the directive

And then using a host binding in the directive would achieve the same result without accessing the element directly.


As for your actual question the best way to orchestrate actions across components is either with services or a store.  You don't appear to be using a store so instead have a service where inside the toggle method you also call a service method where the service method will signal the side bar toggle to the closed state.

By default if you provide a service inside a module and neither component is in another lazy loaded feature module they both get the same instance of the service.  Angular uses a singleton pattern for services.  So yes if you flip a Boolean in a service in one component the other component will *see* the Boolean flipped inside the service.

There are various other methods to achieve the same result relying on angular's built in change detection but really the best way to do this is using an observable which has the side benefit of allowing you to set change detection to on push anyway.  So really my advice is that's what you should be using.

Coming from react you might want to look into ngrx or ng-redux as they are basically redux for angular.  Both use observables for store slices so already handle this kind of stuff in the correct manner.

But that isn't required and you certainly could manually create an observable in a service.

tme321,">First is I'd like to show the directory of uploaded files after a user uploads one. So when someone uploads a file to /uploads, I'd like to show the file names in that directory on page.

You have to have the server set up to send you the structure back, probably as json, and then yes you can show that data in any format you like.

>Second, is it possible to show the JSON data of the file on page as well? I have a csv parser thanks to u/fercryinoutloud that logs JSON data to the console. But how can I show the JSON on the page?

Yes, for a ridiculously simple and not particularly useful example:

    @Component({
        template: `
            <div>
              {{someJson}}
            </div>
        `
    })
    export class ShowJsonComponent {
        @Input() someJson: any;
    }

That will just print out the json you feed it inside a div.  Not super useful on it's own but the basic idea is the same if you want it to look nice.  Its just up to you to format the output onto the template in the desired format.  For instance lets assume for a second that the json we are going to feed it could be described by the interface:

    interface JsonInterface {
        foo: number;
        bar: string;
    }

Then you can make it look a little nicer with a template like:

    <ul>
        <li>Foo: {{someJson.foo}}</li>
        <li>Bar: {{someJson.bar}}</li>
    </ul>

columferry,"Or you could hire me, also Irish but very fluent in Angular.

I would say if your looking to do a technical test, get them to build a small app, using the Angular CLI.

This app should have some key web app components, such as an Authentication system, Web Forms, API calls and some form of use case where data needs to be passed between components.

If we break that down in terms of pages you would have:
Login Page (Potentially a register page also)
Dashboard Page (would navigate to here when they have logged in successfully, or be pushed to login if they try to access before authenticated)
A data entry page, perhaps a contact form?
Then I would incorporate what one of the other users mentioned and have them call the star wars API.
But do this is a particular way. Perhaps make it so there is a search bar and as keys are entered the results from the Web API are filtered.

The reason behind this as that it mean utilising a lot of the features within Angular such as:

Routing
Route Guards to prevent navigation 
Working with the HttpClient
Working with app specific services
Working with forms, potentially letting you see if the dev decides to use Reactive Forms or Template Driven forms.
If you can get them to need to pass data between components you can see how they can handle using the @Input and @Output decorators along with the EventEmitter to transfer data around the app.

Finally I would make them write unit tests for the app and would check their code coverage with ng test -cc to ensure they have covered their app to a high standard",1523605972.0

      --store

      --features
        any http interceptors and other ""features"" that aren't strictly
        instantiated and used by other parts of the app but have app wide
        effects
      --routes
        here each top level route for a lazy loaded module gets its own
    	directory where the base component, module, and routing module go
    	inside these top level route directories these can have their own
    	shared folder for features shared across only that lazy loaded module
    	and can have any number of sub directories for further components that 
    	make up that lazy loaded feature module.
    	They can also have their own store folder for store feature stuff.  So
    	the entire lazy loaded route has all of the stuff specific to it located
    	inside one directory path.
	
One thing to keep in mind is go vertical.  I often end up with a service with the same name as the top level component of each lazy loaded module.  Say I make route foo with component FooComponent and service FooService and provided by FooModule then I end up with

My very first angular app used a layout where there was a directory for components, a directory for services, and a directory for modules.  It's, quite simply, awful to work with that.  Put all the stuff that is closely related like that in the same folder.  Then it's much easier to work with.  Am I working with 'foo'?  Then *all* of it is in the same folder, foo.

We had our best luck with spinning up a small express server during e2e-testing and using proxy.config.json for the app being tested which proxies calls to /api/ to localhost:5000 (or wherever your mock api is running).

The script looked something like:

      npm run e2e:mock-server && npm run e2e --proxy-config e2e/proxy.config.json

Timpi,"router parameters is what you are looking for, you define a single route „/{slug}“  and in your component you can inject the activeRoute and access whatever slug was entered and load data accordingly.

You could also use a Resolver for that.

A quick search for either should give you a good example on how to use it

Edit:
If you want a different layout depending on what data was loaded, you could just use multiple templates in the same component, quick google search pointed me to this [Stackoverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44384460/angular-2-routes-load-different-component-based-on-type-of-parameter) ",1523526760.0

sebbasttian,"Instead of check the slug in a component (as it's in [your example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/8bot88/dynamic_route_creation/dx8gtfc/)), I would use a combination of [UrlMatcher](https://angular.io/api/router/UrlMatcher) and a [Resolve Service](https://angular.io/api/router/Resolve), inside the RoutingModule.

Something like 

    // app.routing.module.ts
    ...
    const matcherCommunity = (url: UrlSegment[]): UrlMatchResult => {
      if ( url.length === 1 && url[0].path === 'community' ) {
        return { consumed: url }
      }
      return null;
    }

    routes.push({ 
      matcher: matcherCommunity,
      component: CommunityPageComponent,
      resolver: CommunityResolver
    })
    ....

Then in the `CommunityResolver` I would call the API and check that the component property that the API returns is the correct one, and redirect to another page if not (maybe an error page or a 404 page, dunno).

The thing of this approach is that you need to know before hand what slug goes with what component, the only thing really dynamic here is the slug (which is what you did in your example). 

I don't have any tip about fetching the component to load dynamically from an API and use that info during routing.

Pros:

* Speaks real HTTP

* Convenient baked in behaviors like ""wait"" (for latency)
* Can be managed via a simple REST API

Cons:

* Harder to do programmatic manipulation of data, e.g. ""add an item to the array after the POST so the next GET will include it""... possible via ""custom behaviors"" and ""injection""
* Data defined in JSON, so there's no typing by default

For every service that has an API resource (we use rest) attached to it, there's a matching plain TS class object that we create from the API response. The TS class implements `APIObject` which means that it has an `id`.

Those API responses are recorded (manually right now) and put into a `.json` file. When we need to test anything we load them from there.

We also use a `mocks.ts` file, and it does take in the fixtures from the json file, but it also includes mocks of the services and components so that we can use them elsewhere without having to deeply test everything where it's not intended.",1523318404.0

That tool also generates us a frontend data service that matches our web api one. It's so nice not having to create classes that match by hand or write API calls trying to remember what the URL is.

 We use acceptance tests to step through and test the UI which are c# and integration tests too on the backend. In SQL we store an audit log of every event in the database and have a mock data service for integration/acceptance tests that generate fake data, and in cleanup it looks through the audit log to remove anything that changed within the test.

In this example, easily spoken, each time an array gets emitted i replace the array by using switchMap and instead emit the values separate by using fromArray (Correctly spoken when your observable emits an array i totally replace it by an all new observable which immediately emits all values of your array indiviual). Then i filter those single values.

Btw add the ""$"" to your observable's and read/name it like this: object$ => object-stream, click$ => click-stream, filteredObject$ => filtered-object-stream.

Does your client have analytics available to an existing website/platform? If so, see what the breakdown is for browser versions. If 80+% are on IE 11+ then there is no need to provide support to IE9

Don't just show your project in the latest version of browser A but also show the little bit broken version in browser Z and how you've made the best of it.  

Manage expectations. Make it very clear to the client you will support browser A,B and C. But not X,Y and Z. Explain what this means for users who have browser X,Y or Z.

Jukeboxjabroni,"You have a few options...

1. **https://angular.io/guide/i18n**

  This is great since its maintained/supported by the Angular team.  It works by scanning your project and extracting translatable values.  When you compile your project you need to compile and deploy it per language.  This is an important distinction to make vs ngx-translate or i18next.

2. **https://github.com/ngx-translate**

  This is one you have already discovered.  It *does* work if you configure everything correctly.  It can pull translations from separate sources/files (ie /assets/en/translations.json, /api/i18n/en, etc.) and comes with a service, directive, and pipe to help you translate your application.  Make sure you also install a loader as well since the core package does not have any specifics built in on how to fetch resources.  If you have very specific needs you can also build your own loaders/parsers as well.

3. **https://github.com/Romanchuk/angular-i18next**

  This is an Angular library wrapping the famous i18next.  Very similar in concept to how ngx-translate works.

An important distinction between 1 and 2/3 is the ""compile per language"" requirement that I mentioned earlier.  If you have a requirement to support app shell for example then this would absolutely be required since the shell being built will have translated text.  You can still support app shell with #2 and #3 in the list above but you would need to ensure you're using the correct node file system loaders instead of the http loaders.

Angulant,"I18n can be pretty hard. Especially when you want to do it right. You should ask  yourself at least these questions:

- Is an agency involved? (They usually dont want JSON files but XLIFF)
- What languages are targeted?
- How perfectionist must it be? In order to do it right you need to change order of the sentence sometimes - especially with numbers, dates and so on.


Either you go with ngx-translate or official i18n. While I'd go with the official solution there are currently some drawbacks - that will get fixed with Angular 6:

- You have to use aot to serve your app (slows down if you don't cut your app in small modules)
- You cant translate strings from your TypeScript classes 

One that is not yet fixed with Angular 6:
Each language is one single file - this might get big for pretty large apps and afaik you cant (yet!) split it up.


The good stuff about official Angular i18n:

- Standard 
- You should be able to 
- It is xliff (every agency accepts)
- Good tooling (https://github.com/martinroob/ngx-i18nsupport/wiki/Tutorial-for-using-xliffmerge-with-angular-cli you can setup auto translate workflow with Google Translate in about 1 hour)

I will say briefly that your concern about services being tangled together and therefore not replaceable doesn't really make sense.  Angular has a di system such that you can inject services into one another and later on you should be able to seamlessly inject a different version of a service as long as it has the same public api as the older version you are replacing.

Lazy-loading is different all together because you are essentially sharing the code-base. This approach you can think of it as a microservice front-end architecture in a way. We call them microsites.

This is especially useful when certain clients have certain modules which you don't want merged into your product code-base.

GrenadineBombardier,"It's actually something we did to gradually convert from angular 5 to react.  Starting at the ""leaves"" of the componen tree, you can convert components over to react, and build your way back to the main entry point.  

The most complex thing, that should be avoided, is attempting to switch *back* to angular, or trying to transclude angular code into a react component (i.e. via props.children).  If you were to do so, angular would lose connection with that transcluded content.  And angular needs its connections.  It can be done, but then you're writing special use cases for your already special use case.

Now, you shouldn't be mounting your react component by trying to put it in the angular template. Don't do that. I'm pretty sure it will just die on you.

As with a normal react entry point, you use ReactDOM.render(...) with a reference to a specific root node that exists just to mount that component. Something like document.getElementById('react-component-root').

So, now that you have a react component mounted in your angular component, you will probably quickly realized that angular component property changes don't trigger react updates, even though you pass them in as props.  You will need to remount the react component with the new props (if you created a mountComponent() method you could just call it again.

Next is getting it to build... To be clear, the normal build webpack configuration was easy. The custom webpack configuration that angular uses for it's unit tests was  a fucking  nightmare.

Angular's test webpack configuration has an irreversible dependency on angular-cli, and you can't actually eject the config from angular-cli, because it is generated programmatically as needed. JIT generation, if you will.

The solution for this is to switch to jest and use jest-preset-angular. It will save your life. Fuck angular's deep and dark dependency on angular-cli. Let jest run those angular tests... It does it faster anyway.

We got the (ejected) webpack build updated to handle the build with angular+react in a workday or two.  We fought the angular-cli webpack nightmare for three weeks or so before finding the jest solution, which we had working flawlessly in 30 minutes.

Lastly, protractor, for your e2e/integration tests.  Protractor is pretty great, especially for angular sites, because protractor connects itself to the angular running on the site, and will pause test progression so long as angular is ""working"".  That is to say, it prevents race conditions.  Your tests won't get ahead of the site.

Enter react.  Protractor does not wait on react, so you have to be mounting your react components in an ngZone.runOutsideAngular(...) callback, otherwise you'll have protractor get stuck waiting forever and cause a timeout. So you run react stuff outside of the angular zone, but now protractor won't try to wait AT ALL for your react components to finish, so the tests start failing because they're going too fast. .. Now you must update your protractor tests with manual wait statements using browser.wait, for things like, waiting until the loader goes away, etc.

These are things you need to know.  Is it possible to inject react components into angular? Quite so, but you should only do it as a means to migrate, because you'll soon learn to ABSOLUTELY HATE zone.js, which underpins every nook and cranny of angular.  Its filthy hands are everywhere, and you will pray for the day that you can convert that one last component, remove the 600 angular dependencies, and breathe a sigh of relief.

I can't see why it should not work.
You say it does work with deleteProduct(), but it does not in addProducts().

That does not make sense, because you are calling the same method in both of them (gettotaal()). Inside of there you are making the required calculations and updates to the variables.

In regards to your bindings ({{}}), they update when you update the variable that is behind it, unless you have messed around with the change detection.
Which you do by calling gettotaal.

Any way, more code would be helpful...  It is not even clear if this is a component (what I assume) or not.

First let me say overall it's really nice.  It works well.  The drag and drop does what I expect and uses animations well to inform me what I have targeted.  Overall it feels nice to use.  So good job.  Any criticisms I mention below should be taken as completely constructive because overall this feels like a well polished game with good functionality.

Having said that, I didn't look around too much but the initial load time seems excessive.  Are you using aot?  There might be a valid reason for the initial load but I didn't see one off hand and it loads almost instantly on subsequent visits so I have to assume it's cached.  What is it that causes the long initial load times?

The gear in the corner should toggle the options screen both on and off.  On my phone at least it only opened the options but I had to use the back button to close them.

I didn't look through the entire code base but 2 things stuck out at what I looked at.

I feel like the game component is just entirely too large and should be broken up more into sub components.  I didn't spend a long time looking through it to tell you where the divisions should be but both the game component size and the game template size are what I would consider excessive and usually indicate that the code needs to be broken up into more sub components.

And, use a linter.  Most of the code is fine. But there are numerous cases of inconsistent code formatting and more than a few instances of the code being too long horizontally for 1 line.  Use a linter to make the code look more uniform and keep the horiztonal line length down to make it all easier to read.

lax20attack,"Angular is not blocking your request, your browser is. A browser doesn't allow you to make cross domain requests unless the server explicitly allows it by sending an 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header. Same origin means same domain AND port, and since you're using a different port, you are restricted.

You can set up Angular CLI to use a proxy to avoid this issue in local development. There's a few ways to do this, but this is how I do it:

1. In angular-cli.json, add a ""serve"" entry under ""defaults"".


    ```""serve"": {
      ""host"": ""0.0.0.0"",
      ""port"": 4200,
      ""proxyConfig"": ""proxy.config.js""
    }```


2. Your proxy.config.js should be placed in the root directory, the same directory as angular-cli.json.

`

    const PROXY_CONFIG = [      {
          context: [
              ""/api"",
              ""/ohmioapi""
          ],

          target: ""http://localhost:54918"",        
          changeOrigin: true,
          logLevel: ""debug""

       }    ]

    module.exports = PROXY_CONFIG;
`

Next time you run npm start, it will fire up the proxy for you.

u6z2,"I used [this site](http://brophy.org/post/nested-reactive-forms-in-angular2/) as my guide for structure to do something very similar in one of my apps. The structure is the same; you have a parent component that needs to display multiple child components, but the child components need to exist in a reactive form within the parent component. Adding another layer of complexity (at least when I did this for my app) is that the child components are dynamic and users can add/remove/update children/children's data on the fly and these changes need to be reflected in the parent's form. It's been a while since I did this, but I'll to capture the main points below:

- You'll need a new component who's responsibility is to store and display a group of child components. So, you have your parent component that will display a - let's call it - ChildCollectionComponent.
- The ParentComponent will pass it's ```FormGroup``` into this ChildCollectionComponent. Within the ```ngOnInit()``` of the ChildCollectionComponent, a new ```FormArray``` is added to this passed-in ```FormGroup``` from the parent, call it ```Children```.
- Since the ChildCollectionComponent creates ChildComponents via an ```*ngFor```, it needs a collection of objects to initialize the initial ChildComponents. Depending on how your app is designed, this may not be the case. You could pass in the data behind the child components into the ChildCollectionComponent and use this.
- ChildComponent will be passed in the ```FormArray``` that was created in ChildCollectionComponent. Within the ```ngOnInit()``` of the ChildComponent after the ChildComponent's form object is created, the child's form is added to the ```FormArray```.

Then again, maybe this is overly complex for you app and you would do better without the intermediate ChildCollectionComponent and simply have the ```ngOnInit()```'s of the child components add their own forms into a ```FormArray``` created by ParentComponent. I did a bunch of research into the 'best way' of doing this over a year ago, so maybe/hopefully there is a better way now.",1520949816.0

While I prefer Angular for full blown SPAs, I think React makes more sense as a server side templating engine than Angular. It's hard to get linters to help with the *ngFor etc in the templates, but in React, everything you do comes from JavaScript/TypeScript, so you can just call `map` on an array of objects in your view model, and the TypeScript compiler can help you translate them to React components or anonymous `div`s.",1520727448.0
Angulant,"You can develop Angular Applications without a store solution - however, this brings small advantages.

But it has to be said, store is not as important in Angular as it is in React for example. We have a dependency injection - there is nothing bad in using a service that holds a subject with data. Then we inject this service everywhere where we need the data. We don't have to worry about code splitting and stuff like this since it is just a usual Angular workflow.

NgRx is probably a good solution, but the boilerplate is frustrating. Also it feels like built in ES5 time (from the language features used). The code generation is terrible imho, If code is so simple we can generate it - then it should be further abstracted and not necessary at all!

But there are many solutions that reduce boilerplate. On a daily basis I stumble across a new lib. Today I found https://github.com/cartant/ts-action - earlier this week https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-ngrx-data

The advantage over ngrx is that you have access to the Redux ecosystem of middleware. You can use the redux dev extension, and choose to use thunks/sagas/Redux-observables for async calls. My only complaint is that the documentation is lackluster.

The parts that are being “shaken out” are all the dependencies that you’ve installed that you’re not importing—without tree shaking you’d have to make your users download the entirety of each library (rxjs, material, etc) instead of just the parts you need (`rxjs/Observable`, `MatCardModule`, etc).

If you want to see what’s included in your bundle, you can install [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer), and point it to your stats file generated by `ng build —prod —statsJson`. Pretty cool stuff.

So unfortunately, your libraries essentially need to be written with treeshaking in mind for it to be effective. Moment.js, for example, doesn’t offer modular imports, so all you can do is import the entire thing. From what I understand, webpack can’t shake that.

jessycormier,"Always refer to the styleguide when you have questions: https://angular.io/guide/styleguide to get a general idea of what are the recommended ""best practices""

The guide strongly recommends using a flat structure and for good reason, being able to find code your looking for easily once your project grows. ( https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#lift )


As some others have suggested you can have lazy loaded modules which lets your app only load what it needs. If I could suggest something I would suggest less about creating structure for ""admins"" vs ""users"" and do it by features, allowing you again to keep a flatter structure. ( https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#folders-by-feature-structure )


You'll most likely always have to restructure your app as it grows simply because it's the nature of the beast. When you create a service it should live as close to the component that needs it only. Once other components can use it, move it up one level until finally if your whole app requires it, move it to the shared folder. An example of this would be if you have a service to wrap functionality around the HttpClient.

Keep referring back to the styleguide as you go and you'll learn a lot :)",1520536482.0

aoakeson,"Though I agree with the above answers, creating multiple apps does have some advantages as well. You can build and deploy separately. If you need to make a change to the admin for example you can without affecting the other apps.  Less code loaded in browser as well. The angular cli supports multiple apps in the same project which makes this really simple. In my project I have 2 apps 1 for public facing and 1 for admin. I do have a shared module for shared stuff in both apps. In my instance it works really nicely since I can deploy separately, and it just feels a bit more secure. For small apps I would not recommend this approach, but just throwing this out as an idea / alternative. ",1520576136.0

You need to treat the original value as immutable and just treat the way you display it as transient state.  Either precalculate all the transient states every time a new actual value is pushed to the component and just flip between them, which seems like the easiest, or leave the original value alone and calculate the actual displayed string on the fly.

I don't know if you would like ngxs to become an out of the box solution like ngrx or vuex or not.

One issue I see with ngxs is the decision to use classes for events. It makes the recording of events (I keep writing actions instead of events :() and deseriaiizing them more difficult and slows down the devtools (at least that's what I heard). We could write a simple plugin to convert the class instances to plain objects simply doing { ...eventInstance } before storing them I think.

I believe you are on the right track rethinking the cqrs pattern in a typescript/angular way. Imho NGRX doesn't offer much incentive over for example ng2-redux. There you get  the rich eco-system of redux and still have the rxjs way of getting to your state and handling side effects when using epics.

An NgModule is intended to be the unit of compilation and the unit of reuse in a (potentially large) Angular project or family of projects. In most cases a library should be packaged as a NgModule, a ""module"" of an application should be published as a NgModule, etc.

Think of a NgModule as a box in which to put a collection of Angular ""things"" (like components) and TypeScript code, out of which a controlled subset can be exported for use elsewhere.

To make sure that they service class (which must appear in a module) remains a singleton, import (and this ""provide"") the module and class just once at the very top of your application. Don't import/provided at each other spot it comes into use.

HttpClient?  It has the same methods taking the same parameters as Http.  All you do is include a different module and inject a different token.  Otherwise you use the two in the same way.

Angular examples prerelease?  Yeah those might be out of date.  It was prerelease for a reason.

I still use angular 5 the same way I used angular 2.

If you see real differences in angular 2 code vs angular 5 code then it probably has more to do with evolving best practices and standards.  Not differences in how things work and not strictly invalidating the way some people wrote angular early in it's life cycle.

The actual differences are pretty negligible.  Ng-template instead of just template due to template not being accepted in the html standard.  Injector token instead of opaque token where they are used exactly the same but injector token takes a generic to provide some type safety.  Things of that nature are actually different.  Minor differences that have no real effect when comparing an angular 2 solution vs an angular 5 one.

tme321,"I'm glad /u/mazaer showed the ngIf / ngSwitch option as I didn't want to type all that out.  Basically what he described is the simplest way and can work if your choices are relatively constrained.  I also think that maintenance of that chunk of code would be horrendous so personally I would strongly hesitate to use that method.  But it is probably the simplest and easiest way to achieve something close to what you want.

Assuming you don't want to do that then you basically take on a pretty big task.

Note that the dynamic component instantiation boilerplate they show in the official docs really isn't that complicated.  It is mostly copy and paste and then add in any small additions to the dynamic component instantiation you want.  And you should only have to implement it a single time, either as a single directive or component, where that single implementation can then be reused for *any* dynamic component you want to create and display.

The main issue you are going to run in to is you have to have a way to describe the layout the users will create in such a way that it is serializable.  This is so you can then save it on your server.  So **don't** use classes with methods on them and **don't** attempt to store the component controller symbol inside your data structure that describes the layout.

Instead you'll want to use lightweight pure data objects to describe the interface and you will need to create a serializer / deserializer to handle your dynamic components probably by assigning each of them a string name.  The simplest approach might look like this:

    class DynamicComponent1 {}
    class DynamicComponent2 {}
    class DynamicComponent3 {}

    class DynamicComponentsSerializer {
        componentsMap = {
            'DynamicComponent1': DynamicComponent1,
            'DynamicComponent2': DynamicComponent2,
            'DynamicComponent3': DynamicComponent3,
        }
        serialize(component) {
            return Object.getOwnProperties(this.componentsMap)
                .find(prop=>this.componentsMap[prop]===component);
        }

        deserialize(name:string) {
            return this.componentsMap[name];
        }
    }

So now that you have a simple serializer you can store the string as part of the data.  Above you have sections, I'm going to call them rows.

    interface DynamicRow {
        components: string[]
    }

    type DynamicLayout = DynamicRow [];

So then you can save a row the user creates like

    const userLayout:DynamicLayout  = [{
        components: [
            ""DynamicComponent1"", 
            ""DynamicComponent1"", 
            ""DynamicComponent2""]
    },{
        components: [
           ""DynamicComponent2"", 
           ""DynamicComponent1"", 
           ""DynamicComponent3""]
    },{
        components: [
            ""DynamicComponent3"",
            ""DynamicComponent2"" 
    }];

So thats the most basic setup for doing real dynamic components.  Then its just a matter of ngIfing over the DynamicLayout type variable and passing each string to the deserialize function then taking that result and throwing it at the dynamic component creation function.

The main thing you'll probably run into quickly is you will want more than just the component name.  Maybe the user can set a few different options on a particular component and you want to save the state.  So pretty quickly the DynamicRow type will probably become more complicated than an array of strings.  Where instead it will be an array of data structures where one of the items inside the data structure is the component name serialized and the other data is whatever the user set.

But the basic idea is the same.  You can just keep iterating on that basic idea.  There are various ways you can handle the serializations too.  For instance instead of manually creating the map you could assign each dynamic component a readonly string that is it's serialized name.  And then you could build the components map instead of hard coding it inside the serializer.

Basically, you can take this solution as far as you want.  It will be complicated.  I won't lie to you about that.  But it is doable.  You just need to think about some way to store what component was picked on the server and then reload that data into the app and have it resolve to the actual components.  Then you just copy the dynamic component boilerplate.  And at that point everything more than that you do is just you adding specific features you want.",1519550256.0
mazaer,"I don't really recommend this approach because I don't think it's very performant, but if you want simple you could do this with a ng switch.

How I did it was I stored the order of the components in an array strings, eg. [""componentA"", ""componentC"", ""componentB"", ...]. The names don't really matter as long as they're unique and in the order you want the components to be rendered.

You would then do something like this:

    <div *ngFor=""let component of components"">
        <app-component-a *ngIf=""component === 'componentA'""></app-component-a>
        <app-component-b *ngIf=""component === 'componentB'""></app-component-b>
        <app-component-c *ngIf=""component === 'componentC'""></app-component-c>
    </div>

My guess is that ng-switch would be faster, but it would work with ngIf as well.

lucas_argolo,I use ngrx library in projects that a lot of frontend components share same data.,1519523242.0
JTenerife,"I've migrated an app to ngrx recently. The app is data-heavy. I have lots of different views (data-views, not components - the components are grids) of the same data. Not only filters, but also mapping of collections to other collections according to different, partly complex business rules.

In the original ""service"" based approach I've ended up reloading some of the data for different views / pages. (I know I could have create another level of shared services.) Anyway, I found the interaction of services and compenents start to become overwhelming. Then I decided to give ngrx a try.

The architecture of the app is much cleaner now. Actually, it's predefined by ngrx. I'm using the idiomatic ""DB style"" state management pattern. The data is normalized in the state. Also, the parameters of my views, like filter, configuration of the data mapping, etc. are in the state.

The whole business logic resides in selectors. Data is resolved using routing guards.

The boilerplate is at the beginning a bit annoying, e.g. if you forget to register your effect and wonder what's going on. Make sure you study the ngrx example app carefully. I kept it opened in a second instance of my IDE.

After all I'm happy with the cleaner, predefined overall architecture and very happy the way I write my business logic in selectors. 

But you should not underestmate the learning curve fo ngrx. It took me a couple of weeks to get into it. That's the true reason not to use it, when you don't need it. Once you've learned it, the boilerplate is not a big issues.

As /u/troytirebiter said: The question is when to use it. Unless you already know that your app is going to be complex (data, as in my case, or in terms of lots of different views), I would start with standard service based state management.

thomasmost,"Angular enforces a lot of good practices for coding at enterprise scale. I recently led efforts to refactor two major AngularJS codebases -- one of them is being refactored to React and one of them we refactored to Angular. I can talk a little bit about what the differences have been, especially from the angle of an existing product.

For React, we have had to develop our own extensive 'conventions' for defining stateless components. I think it may be fair to say, it's easier to do things inconsistently in React than it is in Angular. Inconsistency is death at enterprise level quality, so going ahead with React meant that we chose to use Typescript, strict Redux state management, and complex interfacing for container components to ensure consistency. It's also a little annoying that there is very little documentation on using Typescript with React, though I can't recommend it enough once you get it working. JSX + Typescript (.tsx files!) is an amazing combination.

Refactoring AngularJS to Angular was a little less of a head-trip. A lot of the development conventions are similar, like Dependency Injection and Services. Pipes are a welcome evolution of AngularJS filters, and terminology around components and directives is still largely applicable. On its own merits, Angular is comparable in speed to React, and continues to make speed and size a priority in its (now very fast!) development cycle. Angular produces extremely consistent code, and NgRX is a welcome variation on Redux, which simplifies state subscriptions and makes it super easy to build stateless components that define all of their properties as either Inputs or store Observables.

In the end, it doesn't really matter. They are both excellent, mature frameworks, with growing, enthusiastic communities. Try them both, and go with whatever comes to you more easily.",1519501218.0
hopemanryan,"Well honestly , its an actual framework, it gives you the basic best practices, you can understand the logic by going over the initial build.
react is a view library, i find good for completely different projects  ",1519497171.0
jamra06,"I used React + Redux on a previous project. I personally like Angular a lot better now, but admittedly I was forced to use it. Components with lifecycle hooks are similar between the two. This really helps for integrating non React or non Angular libraries as well as doing anything you need to do around the view rendering.

You can create a component named 

    <my-app-list></my-app-list> 

in either framework. Passing in properties or data work similarly. 

    <my-app-list [list]=""myList""></my-app-list>

The ability to use javascript methods to filter and change your data is also quite similar. You can have a list of data and use map and filter as needed in either framework. 

With React, you don't have any way to communicate between components, so you use something like Flux or Redux. I've only used Redux. Redux makes the component stateless, which helps a lot. The issues I have is that the code in a larger application becomes crowded. The action creators have the potential to touch parts of the code unrelated to what you've worked on. That doesn't scale well on a team. I really like how reducers work. You basically inject which properties or pieces of data you want into your React components. Though many use a Redux-like library called NgRx in Angular, I've found that it's not needed. I use Angular's services and they provide everything I need. You can dependency inject a service and enforce services as singletons so their data is a single source of truth. The other huge difference is RxJs. Observables and Subjects give you the ability to subscribe to data. So when data changes in that one location, it is propagated everywhere it is requested. This handles what Redux does with Reducers, but does so more cleanly since you don't have to have knowledge of the structure of the entire application like you do in Redux. That goes the same for how action creators have to change your global state object. I just find Angular more modular and easier to work with teams on.",1519504576.0
Jaymageck,Being a more opinionated framework leads to a higher likelihood of the team following consistent good practices and also to more DRY code.

MrCartmenes,"I can't really talk about it vs React as I've not used that in anger. However Angular is a really nice dev experience. Using it with the cli makes it very easy to get a project started quickly, and you also don't have to deal directly with web-pack, which is just great. The fact it comes batteries included is great. Then obviously there's all the support for typescript, which although I'm not a type-junkie I do enjoy using for its intellisense. 

Also I really enjoying using ngrx in Angular (yes I know Redux comes from React) but the added benefit of the observable pattern is great. RxJS in general is awesome, really worth investing time in. 

Unit testing with Jasmine/Karma is much improved when using ngrx.

I guess most of the benefits of Angular are either shared by React or can also be used by React (same is true the other way round). I think the difference is how well supported Angular is with typescript and RxJS and that being an all encompassing opinionated framework means eveything is included and you aren't able to make any bad decisions early on.

The react community is way, way bigger and has more momentum than angular. React itself is more of a paradigm than just a library and IMO its a paradigm that allows you to focus solely on how your application should function. I also believe that react will make you a better programmer as it forces you to think about immutability and program with pure functions.

James_Schwartzkopf,"If you're 100% certain you can use ! to tell typescript you know it can't be null: `ActivatedRoute!.parent`.


However, it's usually better to handle the null case that's the whole point behind strictNullChecks in the first place.


A couple of useful utilities:

    //type guard that can be used to strip null and/or undefined from a type
    export function isPresent<T>(t: T|null|undefined): t is T {
      return t !== null && t !== undefined;
    }
    
    //maybeFoo$ could emit either null or a real value.
    const maybeFoo$: Observable<Foo|null> = ...;
    
    //foo$ will only emit when maybeFoo$ emits a value that is not null or undefined
    const foo$: Observale<Foo> = maybeFoo$.filter(isPresent);

If we follow the logic:

- `this.service.getEntity` returns an Observable of some kind
- `this.service.getEntity` is only called if there are changes, if `param1` has changed, if `param2` has changed, and if both `param1` and `param2` are truthy

A few things to check:

- The check for the argument`changes` isn't necessary, `ngOnChanges` will always have a `changes` argument passed
- Make sure changes are being made to BOTH `param1` and `param2` at the same time, or the service call will never fire
- IF both params are changing, make sure the value of both of them are truthy, otherwise the service call will never fire


There's an issue with this code though. You're going to be calling `subscribe` every single time your `ngOnChanges` clause evaluates to true, which means you could end up having multiple subscriptions to the entity returned by `service.getEntity`.

The other issue is that you're not storing the subscription returned by the call to `subscribe` anywhere on your class, which means you're also not calling `unsubscribe` on it anywhere. This means the multiple subscriptions you're creating are never destroyed when the component gets destroyed, causing possible performance issues later on.",1519303589.0

2. Create a service that you can inject wherever you need to to tweak the sidenav. I think it’s called the “appContainerService” or something in my project. You just `.next` an observable in that service, and make the sidenav component subscribe to it.

You could even make a `toggleSidenav` directive that does 2 for you so you don’t need to clutter up your components with injecting that service

Instead, [according to this post from the Angular CLI Github made by one of the devs](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9026) what should be done is to go to the ""test.ts"" file, comment out the following lines,

You have to learn JavaScript and should learn TypeScript, which gives JS some super powers and I think cleans up JS.

The thing to know is that Angular has moved into reactive functional programming with RxJS and observables - big time.  You can code the old way but I think most of us will recommend getting through the pain of learning observables and at least a few main operators.

Observables are like arrays but data flows through them and you can work with that data with operators.  This is something that takes a while to figure out.  There have been a lot of complaints in this group about the steep learning curve.

Tinpotray,"I’ve upvoted a recommendations for WebStorm. I switched from the free VSCode in December and haven’t looked back. I was happy to pay the £40 since it has everything. 

Re: typescript. 

If you have been writing Java for a while then TS will make it much easier for you to move into JS. In fact, if you’re using Angular 2+, then you probably could get along nicely without really knowing vanilla JS. 

(By “vanilla” I mean clean, normal, browser compatible JavaScript)

TS makes JS work a lot more like a heavy-lifting backend language - so with your Java background you’ll probably pick it up easily. 

My own background: 

I was a PHP dev working with Joomla etc. As well as things like Laravel etc. 

I was always interested in mobile app dev so picked up ionic when they moved to angular 2. 

At first NPM etc was a mystery. But I stuck with it because Typescript was so easy to write. 

Really... if it hadn’t been for Typescript, I would have given up with app development and angular completely. 

As a PHP dev I looked at a typical TS class and thought:

“Ah ok... there’s the includes... there’s the class declaration... oh and a constructor... and class methods... easy!”

tme321,">There are ""pipe, map and tap"", but not not much information on what I'm doing, or why.

These are rxjs operators.  Pipe is the built in method of observables that streams, or pipes, it's output through the operators inside the pipe method.

Map is a mapping operator the same as array.map.  Tap is an operator that does something per item emitted but doesn't actually effect the stream directly.  You can basically think of it as the side effect operator.

>And when I have an Observable<Object[]> instead of Object[] I can't run array functions on it anymore (push, filter, etc).

Object[] is an array of objects.  So it has array methods.

Observable<Object[]> is an observable, or stream, that emits arrays of objects.  It isn't an array of objects itself.  It's an observable.  So no, you can't run array methods on it.  It's an object of type observable not type array.  It *emits* arrays but it itself isn't an array.

>The generated HTML get this wierd code: ...

My best advice is just ignore it.  The stuff produced should work as expected.  Don't waste your time trying to figure out what stuff produced by code is really doing.  Do you read through minified code to figure out what it's doing?

>Emit makes a bit more sense... I don't even understand what ""next"" do...

Emit and next do the same thing.  Event emitters in angular are just custom rxjs subjects.  Rxjs subjects by default use the next method to emit the next item.  Since angular is using them as event emitters they added a method called emit to make sense semantically but it just does the same thing next does.  It's just a rename of the function.",1518891453.0

I recommend subscribing to your router's events. Inside the subscription handler, add a simple statement like ""console.log(event)"".

I don't think Angular is a Polymer killer per se as they are solving different problems - Angular is much larger than just components/the view engine, and could in theory work _with_ Polymer components (and AngularJS predated Polymer anyway). But it does seem like there is diminishing developer interest in Polymer anyhow.",1518612902.0
Martinspire,"Polymer has always lagged a bit in popularity compared to Angular and whatnot. And while it is interesting, it does have some problems where it doesn't completely fulfill the requirements of building a new app. You always need something on top of it that in many cases takes over your project. It needs to do a better job in supplying the basics of what most apps will be using. Even if its just external modules that are maintained by Polymer that can easily be included.

Polymer works on technology that isn't really ready yet and needs to do a lot of polyfilling. But in that it loses some of its flexibility and kind of creates a new standard and language where it was really meant to be exactly the opposite.

Having Angular Material makes it obsolete too, so you really need to be wanting to make components in order to succeed. And that is fine for the bigger corporations or companies that are pretty much web-app only, but not a lot outside of that. Small businesses have no use for making dozens of components themselves and are most often better off just making the parts for an application specific because there simply isn't a lot to the applications.

And all of the major ones kind of have that issue. Currently it isn't really simple enough for a business to make separate components, make them available inside company network and have all their styling, markup and logic combined easily. Stuff like Webpack still has a hard time working with things like stylesheets from external modules, especially if you have multiple themes to use.

Overall Polymer isn't dead and probably will stay alive for some time, but I still think Google is shifting most of their attention to Angular because its in a better place right now. There are hardly any major applications developed in Polymer right now which also makes it harder to convince developers to use it. Big business needs commitment and long term support in order to jump in and right now Polymer can't really supply that.

A crash course?  Hire a private instructor.  

Angular isn't like anything else.  You also have to learn JavaScript and then TypeScript before doing much with Angular.

We just call it Angular now and the next version releasing soon is Angular 6.  AngularJS is the old version 1.

Resources? There are online courses but most aren't kept up to date.  Vasco at Angular University does a good job of updating his videos but the editing leaves something to be desired.

Hint:  Anything online dated older than 9/15/16 is worthless with the exception that the latest JavaScript goes back a bit further.  Angular, TypeScript, and RxJS are advancing fast and I set my Google search to one year.

A great way to learn is to start a real project that interests you and then slowly pick away at it as you learn.  You'll scrap the first few attempts, and maybe more.

Like [Benduder](https://www.reddit.com/user/benduder) says, completely delete your node_modules directory and your dist directory. Do npm cache verify (npm cache clear is deprecated, although you can still force use it). 

Then, *I highly suggest* installing [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates), and running that. It will help you see how far behind/under you are from current installs.

NOTE: If you're still on version 2, bumping up to version 4 will def change things for you in the router department. It is, however, an easy fix, especially for smaller projects.

After finishing with npm-check-updates, and your package has been updated, do npm install, and hopefully things will be cleared up.

i_spot_ads,"Just a few remarks when organizing your ng-packagr projects

- lib folder must be inside src folder, that way you can easily run tests for your host and lib at the same time, and it makes more sense, rather than putting lib source code outside src folder.

- File naming convention (for angular projects) is dashed names, not camel case.

- in ngx_photoswipe/lib/package.json don't use ""dependencies"" key, this is a huge mistake, use ""peerDependencies"" instead, because nodemodules will be installed inside the library package folder, and you can be sure your lib users will run into problems when compiling their apps with your lib.

So separate repos for each project has been the best experience for me.  You should be able to deploy a new version of either one without being forced to deploy the other.

Also, you should probably consider using a separate node instance for serving angular as well as that way you can implement ssr in the easiest way currently possible.

And you don't have to but might want to consider nginx over apache.

So basically it would look like:

All on the same machine (doesn't strictly have to be but you can always split this setup onto separate machines later if required):

An instance of node serving the angular app and eventually maybe doing ssr as well.  No direct internet connection.

An instance of node serving the api.  No direct internet connection.

An instance of apache / nginx that is internet facing.  This one maps the requests from the internet to the appropriate node instance, eg api.example.com or app.example.com.

Are you sure that you want to write desktop/mobile only apps with web technologies? I mean, you could probably achieve what you need with Ionic (or use Electron for the desktop app, which is way easier), but if you are fairly new to the scene, learning these tools won't be easy for you.

I'd rather advise you to learn a bit about web development (since Angular 2+ and Ionic are web technologies that can be ran on other platforms, such as desktop and mobile) to learn how to use the tools in their ""native"" (web) environment. Then, once you get comfortable with them, you could try to transfer your knowledge to mobile/desktop development with Ionic or Electron.

Why? See, you might be able to learn how to put Angular 2 and Ionic together to create a desktop/mobile app, but it would be a really, *really* step learning curve that would probably take a long time to tackle and you might get discouraged quickly.

Just take it easy, step by step. Learn the basics first and then go for the advanced stuff - not the other way around. You'll learn a lot of bad habits that way and you'll have a hard time fully understanding the technologies if you learn them in reverse.

tme321,"Lots of people can talk about using observables to transform data, deliver it through services, or the various ways http calls can be made into pipelines and those kinds of things.

And those are great uses of them.  I do them myself all the time.

But one place I think needs more exposure is complicated event handling.  If all you are doing is tying a single callback to a single event then manually creating streams of them is probably overkill.

I have a small component library where one of the main building blocks is a simple sliding panel.  These panels are controlled by a toggle that provides various behavior settings of when to show or hide the panel they are attached to; show on click, show on hover, pin (stay open or closed) vs close when leaving said panel or toggle, etc.

These behaviors are the result of multiple streams of inputs; click, mouse enter, mouse leave, click outside, etc...

So I wrote the [initial version](https://github.com/tme321/Unopinionated-Angular/blob/move_to_ng-packagr/src/app/lib/sliding-panel/sliding-panel-toggle.directive.ts) in a very synchronous manner.  I got the events that originate outside the toggle as observables but all I did was immediately subscribe to them and use a bunch of flag state variables to track what was going on.

That code is... awful.  It's brittle and pretty much impossible to touch without messing up the behavior.  And it takes a long time just to create a mental model of what all those flags are even tracking.

So I refactored [that code](https://github.com/tme321/Unopinionated-Angular/blob/master/src/app/lib/sliding-panel/toggle/sliding-panel-toggle.directive.ts) entirely into a single stream of observables on events.  And now I think it's much easier to understand.  I'm not afraid to make changes to it anymore if necessary.

I still think that stream could be made a bit better.  The biggest issue left is I still have the previous state being tracked synchronously outside the stream.  I've just been busy and haven't had a chance to go back and refactor it yet.

The method types should be defined in terms of interfaces, no question. Because that gives you flexibility of implementation.

Ts will let you either coerce a random object into that interface, or use a formal class.

Because of the coercion, many people will say you don't need classes, which is true. But there are some advantages. Certainty if you are actually putting implantation into your classes. But also a number of the coercion methods will fail if you don't populate all properties.

I tend to think that if you do the following:

        userID: username,
        password: pwd

you are in fact ""instantiating"" an object.  So I've always been under the mind that this translates to the need for a class.  Due to my C# background I prefer to do something along the following:

    const credentials = new AuthData(username, pwd);

I think of interfaces in the more traditional OO sense in that its a means of enforcing a standard set of method signatures across various classes. 

So I guess the question is do interfaces take on a different definition in TS vs traditional OO languages like C#/Java?  It kinda seems that ones background  will make you prefer one over the other.  

C#/Java converts will probably prefer classes and JS converts will lean towards interfaces as they prefer the dynamic object syntax.

JTenerife,"There're some things to consider for potential more complex scenarios. You can generalize your task by looking at it like querying a database. All CRUD operations on your data could change your result set: Obviously deletion of a record (object), creation, but also changing if a change affects the query.

If you only query single objects and you can be sure that there are not creations and deletion going on, then your approach can work.

But are you really requesting each object seperately? If not: What if an object was deleted on the server? You would need to take this into account.

Technically, as u/tme321 said, it's typically a use case for websockets. Depending on the number of updates per time and the requirements for your app to be up to date you should think of upgrading your webserver (your current doesn't seem to support websockets). I havn't used Node with socket.io, but this seems to be quite the standard. 

If the requirements are not that strict and the data volume and change rate is no that large - maybe a simple global timestamp for the latest change is enough to indicate a complete reload of the data? You wouldn't need to worry about the details of the change detection. E.g. if your data only changes every 10 mins or so, and it's a couple of megs, I wouldn't worry at all.

tme321,"Ok so these are just a few ideas of approaches.  You didn't really provide enough information about exactly how this all needs to work.  So if you want more in depth help you'll need to provide more info.

>I want to create a stream that spikes off a subject. It processes the subjects data whenever the subject emits something new (as you'd expect). How it processes the data is by calling several HTTP requests and mapping and filtering etc.

Are all the http requests required to be resolved before you emit a single final value?  If so you can use zip which takes multiple observables and outputs once when they all emit 1 new item.  Also we'll use flatmap to extract the data from the inner observable results of the http calls.  

So lets say you have 3 http calls like (assume these are all members inside a service or whatever):

    private http1() {
        return this.http.get(...);
    }
   
    // and http2 and http3

And you have a subject that is supposed to kick off all 3:

    private sub= new  Subject<boolean>();

So, just for a tiny bit of efficiency lets cache the stream somewhere:

    private data$: Observable<SomeComplexType>;

Then you can create a pipeline observable like this:

    public fetchNewData() {
        sub.next(true);
    }

And you create the observable like maybe inside the constructor:

    constructor() {  
        this.data$ = this.sub.asObservable().pipe(
            zip(
                this.http1().pipe(flatmap(res=>res)),
                this.http2().pipe(flatmap(res=>res)),
                this.http3().pipe(flatmap(res=>res)),
                (boolFromSub, res1, res2, res3)=> ({
                    http1res: res1,
                    http2res: res2,
                    http3res: res3
                })
        )
    }

And finally you create a function, or a getter whichever, to return the stream to any would be listeners:

     public get fetchResults$() {
        return this.data$;
    }

So now when anyone calls fetchNewData() that will trigger the subject to emit.  Each time the subject emits each of the 3 http functions will be called and their results will be extracted from the observable that http.get returns by the flatmap operator.  Then I used a mapping function (a part of zip, it has an optional mapping function parameter) to combine all the results into a single object.  Listeners that subscribe like fetchResults$.subscribe(res=>...) will see the object that the zip operator maps all the results to.

Now you mentioned having a loading indicator.  So what I would do is make a new stream.  Again a simple cache of the observable:

    private _isLoading$: Observable<boolean>;

And again in the constructor, or somewhere similar, you could create the stream.  Here I would reduce the emissins of the original sub and the final observable to simple booleans.  That can be done simply with a map operator.  Then I would just merge the two streams.  So as soon as someone calls fetchNewData it will emit a true and once the http calls complete and the zip operator above finishes it will call false:

    constructor() {
        //assume same definition for this.data$ as above

        _isLoading$ = this.sub.pipe(
            map(_=>true),
            merge(this.data$).pipe(map(_=>false)),
        );
    }

And again a getter

    public isLoading$() {
        return this._isLoading$;
    }

Now below you talked about filtering.  Zip won't work well with actual filtering as it will never emit a new items until *all* of it's parameters have emitted a new item.  So you'd be stuck waiting.  One way you could work with filtering is to use combineLatest instead of zip.  You would need to make sure every parameter to combineLatest emitted at least once.  And you would always get whatever the last non filtered result was.  So it might not be what you want.  But combineLatest would emit every time any of the observables comes up with a result rather than wait until they all do.  You could even add a debounce operator to the end of the stream so actual subscribers don't see a new value until all of the streams have had a chance to emit.

Another way you could do it is instead of truly filtering you could map the results.  Say something like

    map((res: ResultType): ResultType & { success: boolean} => { 
        //do some pseudo filter here
        if(passesFilter(res)) {
             return { ...res, success: true };
        } else {
             return { ...res, success: false };
        }
    } 

Then later on you could read the result of that map operation and handle it differently depending on if res.success is true or false.  That's just one idea off the top of my head mind you.  I wouldn't 100% use this method, but it *can* be useful if you must have each stream emit something in order for it to work right.

Long answer: What you are showing is the dev serving build and not the production build. 

First, you are using the **JIT** compiler when running on dev which includes the compiler in the app when served. Switching to **AOT** compiles your app before hand significantly reducing weight. 

The next thing is Tree shaking and vendor code. For example, your app includes **moment.js** so it is loaded, but **angular-moment** ALSO includes **moment.js** and both versions are typically the full uncompressed versions. The first thing webpack will do is smash all the duplicates, then it will shake out/remove the old code, then minify.

it will fail if you don't know what you are doing or don't have the budget to pay for quality developers.

tme321,"Sorry but I'm having a really hard time following here.  

Are you trying to dispatch an action that sets a status and then the status setting action is intercepted by an effect that actually fetches some data?

Offhand, this just looks awkward and wrong.  But I might not be understanding exactly what it is you are doing here.  Dispatching multiple actions at once to the store as your effect is doing is usually wrong.

At a higher level what should happen is you have 2 effects and 3 actions.  

The first action is dispatched as normal from a component or service.  This one is basically ""start loading the things"" where it will probably do something analogous to setting a boolean isloading to true so you can display a spinner.  Or something along those lines.

The first effect looks for this action and when it sees the load action it calls out to the api to actually get the data.  When the api call returns it should dispatch an action to the store, set data.  This action would set the data into the proper place in the store.

Then the second effect looks for this set data action.  When it sees a set data action it then dispatches a load completed action.  This load completed action would just toggle the isloading Boolean back to false.

But I can't tell for sure if that's what you are even trying to accomplish here.  Is that close or did I completely miss the Mark?

Either way this doesn't require web workers.  That is massive overkill.

Oh, also depending on how fine grained you make your actions it's possible to completely eliminate the 2nd effect and the load completed action and in addition to having the set data action put the data into the store it could also be read by a reducer to set the isloading back to false.

Use curlies in the template if you like.  Personally, when I have this need I usually have markdown for the majority of the page content and pipe it through a markdown pipe and html sanitizer.

Of those four things you've created, you need only one:

    export class Consultation {
        id?: number;
        submitted?: boolean;
        showed_up?: boolean;
        signed_up?: boolean;
     }

If you want an easy way to initialize an instance of this class, you just add a constructor:

    export class Consultation {
        id?: number;
        submitted?: boolean;
        showed_up?: boolean;
        signed_up?: boolean;

        constructor(
            id?: number,
            submitted?: boolean,
            showed_up?: boolean,
            signed_up?: boolean,
        ) {
            this.id = id;
            this.submitted = submitted;
            this.showed_up = showed_up;
            this.signed_up = signed_up;
        }
     }

In Typescript, you can eliminate all the boilerplate by writing this (semantically equivalent):

    export class Consultation {
          constructor(
              public id?: number,
              public submitted?: boolean,
              public showed_up?: boolean,
              public signed_up?: boolean,
          ) {
          }
       }

To create an instance, you just use:

    let c = new Consultation(10, true);

There are reasons to use interfaces, but you can safely ignore them until you get down the basics.
",1516833866.0
wolfhoundjesse,"I guess it would depend on what you plan to do with your models. I only use interfaces:


    export interface Consultation {
        id?: number;
        submitted?: boolean;
        showed_up?: boolean;
        signed_up?: boolean;
    }

    let c = Object.assign({}, <Consultation>{ 
        id: null,
        submitted: true,
        showed_up: null,
        signed_up: false
    });

That will create a new object with those values, if that's what you really wanted to do. 

The `ConsultationClassImp` made me chuckle because I remember doing something like that years ago.

The interface is not compiled to anything. It's just a contract that says, ""Someone may create a thing that has this shape.""

vuestrik,"Well, the transfer from Angular JS to Vue is much easier than to Angular 2+. With Vue you will have also much bigger talent pool than with Angular. React developers can pick Vue in almost no time. It will be also much easier to train ordinary jquery developers. 

Regarding the better scalability of Angular - this is pretty common claim which I believe doesn't have sound foundations. Vue for example provides official state management (Vuex) which is a really good library.  The whole Vue community pretty much agrees that this is the way how to handle state in complex applications. On the other hand, in Angular you have multiple possible approaches - services with Behavior Subjects, ngrx, redux bindings...Also Angular applications vary in the way how heavily they use rxjs. Some teams try to avoid it since they don't understand it well. On the other hand, there are skilled ngrx programmers who use it everywhere which might be yet another potential source of friction. 

There are not many things that Angular has out of box which Vue doesn't. The few things that come to my mind are the http and form validation modules. Well, I don't miss neither of them in Vue. IMHO, the both form validation modules in Angular are rather simplistic and I was able to find a library for Vue which was much more suitable for our specific use cases. Regarding the DI and Modules - I think that there is no coincidence that the React community doesn't use anything like that either. I'm pretty sure that the React thought leaders would figure out some solutions if they considered them neccessary. The reasons that they are not heavily used in the React ecosystem are simple -  they are almost useless for front-end javascript development. For every single problem they solve you have simpler and less obtrusive solutions. I'm saying this as a someone who has 10 years of enterprise C# development experience and as a someone who was a big fan of DI before it even became mainstream in the .net world. 

In my opinion Vue is much more flexible than Angular. You can tailor it to pretty much any use case much easier than Angular. The reasons for this are the simpler yet powerful and flexible foundations of Vue itself. Remember, complex applications often need to handle scenarios that are way beyond the framework authors imagination and the more flexible library is really advantageous there. And the last thing, you can use typescript with Vue as well and if you are crazy enough and don't mind using jsx then you might get much better type safety in the templates than in Angular.  

I'm sorry if anybody thinks that I'm too harsh to Angular. Probably I'm, sorry for that.  But I do feel that I must fight misconceptions that some people have - for example the mythical structure that Angular provides. No framework can turn bad programmers into good ones and the least problem of large software systems is the fronted framework they use (well, almost). Healthy companies with good enough employees can enforce coding standards and best practices with any framework. The unhealthy ones with mediocre sloppy programmers are screwed with any framework.",1517352390.0

synalx,"Hi there! I'm Alex, the author of `@angular/service-worker`.

There are certainly downsides to both Service Workers in general, and `@angular/service-worker` (NGSW) in particular.

Service Workers fundamentally change the deployment model of web applications. As web developers we're used to pushing new application code to production and having it instantly live for anyone loading the app after the push. With proper HTTP cache management, we don't expect users to remain on old versions of the application. Service Workers significantly complicate this model, and make web app deployment behave more like native application deployment - users have an installed version of the application, and updates happen in the background. Eventually all users should see the new version of your site, but the TTL of an old version in the wild is measured in days/months, not seconds.

Service Workers can also affect performance and bandwidth usage, negatively as well as positively. While SWs generally make applications faster by eliminating dependency on the network for critical resources, they must also load those resources into their cache in the first place, and that aggressive prefetching can compete with the initial application load.

NGSW in particular also has its downsides. Unlike many other SW implementations (e.g. Workbox), NGSW does not allow including running your own code in the SW itself - it's a self-contained worker. It also has a more complicated update model than most other SWs, and it can be harder to reason about NGSW's state.

Normally, you'd always hit the ""root"" view and the load method would be called, but if you refreshed the browser it clears everything and starts from scratch - if your in the ""things"" page when your refresh you never hit the ""root"" page that called the ""loadAllThings"" method.

My solution was to `take(1)` in the sub page, and subscribe. If there was no data, (undefined) then call the ""loadAllThings"" method. If there was data, just do nothing. Something like:

    things$.take(1).subscribe(things => {

The closest you could get would be to have some assertions that certain objects have certain expected properties before you try to read them.

mankanshokumako,"First up, your code should work if you use await:

    let id: number = await this.ticketService.getNextID();

Second: I disagree with martijnschimmel, don't use an Observable just because you don't know how Promises work. It is much better to understand both concepts and in which scenarios to use them.

A promise is nothing else but a helper to make asynchronous programming easier to manage (and also more standardized, there have been similar solutions around, like jQuery.deferred). All that is happening is that one of the two callbacks (resolve & reject) is being called when the asynchronous operation has finished (resolve) or threw an error (reject) - so it is just a wrapper about how to handle callbacks, which has been a javascript concept since forever. The nice thing about Promises is (or was, if you're now using the await keyword) that asynchronous code looked synchronous since you could chain your code with the .then() & .catch() methods like this:

    service.getSomeAsyncStuff().then(someAsyncResult => {
        // for example purposes, next service call needs something from first async result
        return service.someOtherAsyncStuff(someAsyncResult.someProperty);
    }).then(someOtherAsyncResult => {
        console.log(someOtherAsyncResult);
    }).catch(e => console.error(e));

But now, thanks to TypeScript / Babel the await keyword helps you make that code much more readable (and writable!):

    try {
        let someAsyncResult = await service.getSomeAsyncStuff();
        let someOtherAsyncResult = await service.someOtherAsyncStuff(someAsyncResult.someProperty);
        console.log(someOtherAsyncResult);
    } catch(e) {
        console.error(e);
    }
    
However, every method / function that uses the await keyword **must** be async itself, since now it is required to return a Promise. It couldn't be any other way if you think about it.

As for when to use Promises and when to use Observables: It is difficult to write something objective that won't get obliterated here, since it seems so subjective. Make up your own mind, ideally by first reading the thoughts of other people out there, there is plenty of resources.

I personally love to use Observables when binding data from a service to the UI, but all of my actual data fetching from an HTTP api are handled via Promises, because that's exactly their use case - a **one time delayed execution**.


edit: oh an here is how I would clean up your code a bit

    import { Injectable, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';
    import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
    import { MatSnackBar } from '@angular/material';
    import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

        public success: boolean;
        public message: string;
        public maxTicketID: number;
    }
    
    @Injectable()
    export class TicketService {
        url = 'http://localhost:8080/api/getNextTicketID';
    
        private maxid: number = 0;
        public create: EventEmitter<any> = new EventEmitter();
    
        constructor(private http: HttpClient, private snackbar: MatSnackBar) { }
    
        private async poll() {
            let response = await this.http.get<Result>(this.url).toPromise();
    
            console.log(""response"", response);
    
            return response.maxTicketID;
        }
    
        public async getNextID() {
            let nextId = await this.poll();
            console.log(""nextId"", nextId);

Dunos,"I think you are mixing async/await methods with promises, which imo you should not do. Here's a reading that may help you understand better how async works --> https://hackernoon.com/6-reasons-why-javascripts-async-await-blows-promises-away-tutorial-c7ec10518dd9",1516363846.0
EricTboneJackson,"getNextID is async, so it doesn't return a value directly, it returns a *promise* of a value. Its return type is not `number`, it's  `Promise<number>`.

Side note: you would have learned this if you'd included a return type in your method definition. This is one of several reasons you should always do that. The type system doesn't help you if you don't use it.

Anyway, with that in mind, can you see why you're getting that error now?

    // NOTE: this function appears to be returning a number, but because
    // it's an async function that automagically becomes a Promise.
    async getNextID(): Promise<number>  {
        return 10;
    }

    let id: number = this.ticketService.getNextID();
    // Type Promise<void> is not assignable to type 'number'.

So what you want is this:

    let idPromise: Promise<number> = this.ticketService.getNextID();
    idPromise.then((id: number) => console.log(""Now we have a value:"", id));

You can write this code more succinctly (as long as you're in an async function), like this:

    let id: number = await this.ticketService.getNextID();
    console.log(""Now we have a value:"", id);

That does the same thing as the previous two lines. It just waits for the Promise-like object to return a value.

The regular user interface shouldn't have ""illegal"" actions tied to any of its interface.  And the actual data on the server should be properly guarded by authentication.  So the only ""bad"" thing that can happen is someone can break into your angular code with the console and fire an action they aren't permitted to which shouldn't do anything destructive on the actual server so... who cares?

If a user wants to make the front end code do something that it's not supposed to they are only messing up their own session.  And anyone going to the console and modifying code is well aware that what they are doing isn't how the app is supposed to work.

So the admin interface shows buttons or whatever that map to these actions.  But the normal user interface doesn't.  In the end the server isn't going to allow a user to do something they shouldn't be allowed to anyway so it really doesn't matter if someone digs into your front end code and modifies it.

Tldr: don't bother splitting at all.  The front end has no security anyway.  The interface should only show what a user is allowed to do but don't go out of your way to try and stop something you can't fundamentally stop anyway.  It's just a waste of development effort.",1516074159.0

jason_gates,"Hi,

The typical use of the angular router does not include an ""a.target"" attribute.

Typically, you use a router link directive (instead of a ""a.href"" html attribute). The a.href attribute is intended to make a request to a server. The router link directive is intended to make a request to the angular router.

I recommend starting with a simple/typical use case first:

Remove the a.target attribute.

Define a route with parameters ( path: 'page/:id', component: DashboardComponent ).

Replace <a href= ....../> with <a [routerLink]=""['/page','5203']"">...</a>

JTenerife,"Angular among other frameworks (React, Vue) let's you create SinglePageApplications (SPAs). In contrast to older frameworks (e.g. ASP.NET Web Forms), which prepare the HTML page on the server and send this HTML page to the browser, the SPAs ""create the HTML"" by manipulating the DOM on the client (in the browser) using Javascript.

While the older frameworks can incorporate the data from the DB when preparing the HTML page on the server, a SPA must get the data from the server seperately. The server has to provide the data via a so called Web API, which can be called by the client using http requests (that's what the Angular http module is for). They usually return the data as JSON objects. You already created the JSON data in your tutorials reading and writing to a file - now you just need to get these JSON data from an http request instead of a ""fs.readFile()"".).

The new ASP.NET Core (you seem to use a Microsoft Stack that at your workplace) allows you to create such a Web API. In fact, that's the preferred way nowadays.

The ASP.NET world is a bit confusing - there're tons of tutorials. I can recommend this course (ASP.NET as backend) - but unfortunately it's not free. This course gives you the whole big picture.

https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aspnetcore-mvc-efcore-bootstrap-angular-web/table-of-contents

Other technology stacks on the backend are very popular as well. Mostly Node.JS (and the framework Express). The big advantage here is that you don't need to switch context regarding the programming language and environment. So, for a quickstart, I'd suggest to create a Express Web API:

jprest1969,"I'm 66 and learning JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Node.js, reactive programming, Postgres, and Material.  I have some time although not retired (ever) and this has been quite a journey.  I don't mind paying for tutorials but there are few that are current.  Vasco at Angular University does a good job of staying current but his editing sometimes sucks.

1)  Do the Tour of Heroes tutorial and learn the Angular Docs.  https://angular.io/tutorial   They are becoming pretty good now but were sketchy a year ago.  Be aware that the new http module is HttpClient, not the older Http.

2)  Pay Vasco $100 and do his courses.

3)  When I'm learning something new I usually read through a book for a topic such as JavaScript then dig into tutorials and start coding.  You learn coding by coding, not reading.  

4)  You learn in layers.  Do a tutorial then go back to your book and Web searches then back to a tutorial.

5)  If you have an application in mind then set it up in the CLI and get rolling.  You will learn faster if your app is relevant to your life.

6)  When doing Google searches set the time in Tools to one year.  Anything older for Angular is mostly worthless and will get you confused.  A few months ago I was finding Angular Http module tutorials that were published months after the new HttpClient came out in August.  You have it easier now.  The documentation is better and Angular development is much more stable than even a year ago.

7)  We've moved beyond MVC to reactive functional programming.  Learn RxJS and how to work with Observables.  It is really hard to get your head around Observables but think of them as an array that data flows through, like a pipe, and the operators let you work with that data.  

8)  Setup a server on your computer with Vagrant.  Pretty easy to setup a Ubuntu server which is probably the most popular of the Linux line. You don't need to do anything with your work computers.  For enterprise I prefer the Postgres database but also learn a NoSQL db such as Google's Firebase.  MySQL db works fine also.

9)  Learn Node.js with the Express framework or use DreamFactory and script in Node.  Those are middleware that sit on top of the db and create REST apis.  I'm using DF.

10)  Spend a lot of time on Stack Overflow.  Monitor the Angular and Angular Materials feeds with an RSS reader on your desktop.  I use NewsBar on my Mac.  Learn to create questions that make sense and don't waste people's time.  Study the questions that are upvoted.  Again, watch the dates because a lot of older stuff is outdated.  https://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag/angular,  https://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag/angular-material

11)  Put all your rest calls in Angular on a service module so if you change db's most of the work will be there and not scattered all over your app.

Here is how a typical web application works:

The client tier connects to a web server (server tier). The web server hosts a server application (E.G. node express, python django, php wordpress, etc, etc).

The server application connects to a database server.

The server application returns data to the client tier (angular app).

Note! Typically a client (angular app) never connects directly to a database server. The server application connects to the database server (not the client angular app).

sikolio,"We did this on a project we finished last month. 

Let's say you created the main app in a repository. Then we created some communication architecture core in place for the main app to communicate with the feature module (search/deepLinks/etc).

We moved this ""core"" into their own library (which we didn't package with ng-packagr as it had a problem with the router). Afterwards we created the feature module using the parts needed from the core on a different repository who depended on ""core"".

We compiled that feature module with ngc in order to be sure that the module can compile and that sort of things.

Finally the main application is responsible for compiling the src for the feature module, this is because Angular has to know versions and things (I have a quote on this on my laptop). We tried bundling the feature module with webpack but in the end it didn't work.

So to add the feature module to the compilation what you have to do is add the src folder to the include array on the tsconfig.app.json and make sure you are excluding the tests.

daelin,"Your selection is logically part of the app state, which means it should be in the store and available to your selectors.  So, ultimately, you don’t need the parameter.

I know it might sound like globals and seems icky, but that’s because of perspective. The point of ngrx is that your app’s view is a pure function of the state object.  Your store is the input, not any parameter you want to pass to your selectors.

I run into this conflict from time to time and the answer usually eventually meanders its way to “it should have been in the store in the first place.”

The only time I really get away from this answer is when the selection state is in the router.  This works at first for simple views, but ultimately you wind up putting that in the store too as you progress.",1515997462.0
tme321,"Your first idea is correct.  Pass a parameter to the selector.  Think of the store as a database and your parameter to a selector function is similar to a parameter passed to a select statement in sql.

Having to resolve the correct part of the state inside subscribes constantly is messy.

The other option, which *sometimes* is useful but that I don't use generally, is to attach a map or similar operator to the store select before subscribing.  Most of the time it's better to just modify the selector but sometimes I want to dynamically change which part I'm receiving without making a new store selection call so in those instances it can make sense to do it as an observable operator.  But those cases are rare.

Either way actually doing the access in the subscription is the last method I would choose.",1515883789.0

tme321,"Don't get put off by the size of the api.  Realize that the api includes everything but you don't have to.  Start with the parts that are somewhat familiar to you; components.  

You'll quickly come across ngModules when doing that.  Short version is they aren't my favorite part of angular or anything but they are your window into the di system and they aren't particularly complicated.  Just some annoying housekeeping.

But then, assuming your using the cli, there are cli options during code generation to already put the newly created component or service into one of these modules.  Learn how to use it (the -m flag which takes a ./path/to/some.module.ts and . is /src/app) and you can *mostly* ignore the ngModules.  In addition the cli also allows you to specify lazy loading by breaking up the parts to be loaded into these ngModules so you get added functionality.  In other words yes they are a bit annoying but they do allow you to configure things in various ways.

Speaking of the cli use it.  Use the cli, use the cli, use the cli.  The angular cli supports an eject command same as the react one so *if* you ever truly need to stop using the cli you aren't stuck.  But you should consider long and hard *why* you don't want to use the cli in the first place.

Learn how to actually take advantage of the di system.  It's one of the best parts of angular and should be used to your benefit.  If you aren't familiar with di systems it might help you to learn about how a di system is used and useful outside of the context of angular.  Then you can apply that knowledge to angular.

Learn rxjs, it's the other best part of angular.  It can be daunting at first if you have never used anything like it before but once you get to the hang of it you will want to start using it everywhere.

Finally, I think the [official tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial) is still one of the best.  Depending on how experienced you are with software development in general you might not need to go through the whole thing but at least start at the beginning and *actually write the code*.  Don't just look at the examples.  Write it yourself.  Even change little things as you go so you *know* what's going on.

Oh I should add that coming from react you'll probably want to look in to either [ng-redux](https://github.com/angular-redux/ng-redux) or [ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx).  They are both redux implementations with angular specific bindings.

          });

        return next.handle(req);

robwormald,"This is *possible* using the Angular CLI, but there are some caveats:

Your own decorators (like u/mlapis example) is perfectly fine, as Angular basically ignores decorators it doesn't know about. 

What's not possible is using your own custom decorators to *modify* Angular's decorators - that is, you can't create a `@FancyInput()` decorator that adds the `@Input` decorator behind the scenes.

You should also be aware the the decorator specification is changing, and while Angular has insulated ourselves from such a change, we don't recommend basing your application functionality off of them, at least until the specification finally lands. Again though, we do not actively prevent you from using them.

See https://gist.github.com/robwormald/9379194b191700b6564f8e8e2b077b95 for a simple example that drops right in and works. ",1515707047.0

benduder,"My personal pattern is to instantiate model classes in the API services, then pass these ""inflated"" objects into the components. For example, if there is a `CardsService` that requests card data from the API, I would do something like

    export class CardsService {
        constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

        public getCards(): Observable<Card[]> {
            return this.http
                .get('/url/to/cards/api')
                .pipe(map((payload: ICardPayload[]) => payload.map(p => new Card(p)));
        }
    }

with a `Card` class defined as such:

    export class Card {
        constructor(payload: ICardPayload) {
            ... some initialisation logic...
        }
    }


Then there would be some parent component that loads all the cards by calling the service:

    @Component(...)
    export class CardsComponent implements OnInit {
        public cards: Card[] = [];

        constructor(private cardsService: CardsService) {}

        public ngOnInit(): void {
            this.cardsService
                .getCards()
                .subscribe(cards => this.cards = cards);    
        }
    }

whose template looks a bit like:

    <card *ngFor=""let card of cards"" [card]=""card""></card>

Then a `CardComponent` which expects a `card` input:

    @Component(...)
    export class CardComponent {
        @Input() public card: Card;
    }

This of course all assumes that a `Card` is a valid term in your data model as opposed to just being a UI card. An alternative would be to use the `async` pipe and avoid the subscription logic.",1515677987.0

* We’ve added fullTemplateTypeCheck as an angularCompilerOption that uses TypeScript to validate binding expressions in your templates. We recommend you enable this flag, as it will become the default in a future major release. Learn more about the various compiler options supported in Angular.

**Support for TypeScript 2.6**

* Angular now supports TypeScript 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6. Check out some of the new features in TypeScript 2.6.

**Improved Router Param & Data Inheritance**

* Previously, nested routes would only inherit parameters and data from parent routes if the parent route did not have a component set.

tme321,"Assuming by chrome storage you mean local and session storage I've just been playing around with the same thing.

There are two issues with the approach of syncing with ngrx.  

The first is that part of the idea behind state management with these techniques is single source of truth.  By mirroring the state from storage to ngrx I feel like you are violating this pattern.  It's similar to trying to store anything about the current route in ngrx.  The router is already acting as the single source of truth so mirroring the data into ngrx just seems wasteful and possibly error prone.

The second issue is that local storage has an event tied to it's values changing.  Which is great.  But session storage does not.  At least not in all browsers.  Which means that even if you subscribe to the local storage event if you are also or only using session storage then the lack of an event means you can end up out of sync.

---

Focus hard on developer evangelism. I don't care if it dominates like in the AngularJS days, but it doesn't inspire much confidence in its long-term future to see almost every relevant reddit / Hacker News comment calling it a dumpster fire.

As part of this, better care could probably be taken to stay attuned to even superficial things that people in the wider JS community will care about. The most obvious past example is using the name ""Angular 2.0"" instead of something like ""Angular Next 1.0"" (maybe with a long-term plan to EOL AngularJS + rename it to ""Angular Legacy"" and Angular Next to ""Angular""), which would have avoided a lot of user confusion and searchability problems that continue to this day.

Aside from PR, a few efforts come to mind as potentially worth investing in:

1. A really really solid AngularJS -> Angular upgrade path. I used UpgradeModule for a product that wasn't extremely large, and it worked well enough to be worth the effort, but the time investment was still fairly costly for us as a small startup. For others stuck with AngularJS projects, I think a lot more could be done:

  a. Continue pushing out AngularJS releases that continue adding optional features to gradually converge with Angular.

  b. Add an `ng new --angularjs` option to the CLI that walks the user through migrating their existing code to the new project structure and plugging UpgradeModule into the right places in the right way.

  c. Release an AngularJS version of Angular Material (a simple wrapper that depends on Angular + UpgradeModule) and a tool to automatically convert AngularJS Material code to Angular Material code, with line numbers of AngularJS Material code printed where 1:1 conversion isn't possible.

  d. Add an option to the CLI to automatically do a big bang conversion of `ng new --angularjs` projects to pure Angular, to the extent possible. I know this can't be done 100%, but a lot of the work in this last step is basic syntactical stuff like `ng-if` -> `*ngIf` and `my-custom-attr='balls'` -> `[(myCustomAttr)]='balls'` that would be easy to automate.

2. Embrace the competition. Maybe so many people wouldn't be so generally sour on Angular if Angular's router, DI framework, and so on were easily usable with React and ultimately became well respected in their own rights among the React community.

  a. Maybe Angular could ultimately support using different view frameworks for different component classes — e.g. maybe I have Angular, React, Vue, Aurelia, and Svelte components all coexisting in the same Angular project (this isn't all that different from what UpgradeModule already allows). Maybe the CLI could even support something like `ng new --view-framework=react` to create projects where React is used by default in all generated components.

  b. Maybe 2a could be accomplished with a generic view framework adapter API, allowing any independent developer with her own implementation of VDOM or similar to benefit from the tooling and ecosystem of Angular. Third parties could also use this to create an equivalent to UpgradeModule for their old Backbone projects, and maybe this could be used to hook Angular into Qt/QML (for a desktop-supporting alternative to NativeScript).",1515542996.0

g00glen00b,"If you have a user visiting your application and updating a single task, you probably need the following API calls:

1. `GET /api/tasks` to fetch all tasks
2. `GET /api/tasks/1` to fetch the info of the task the user wants to edit
3. `PATCH /api/tasks/1` to update that task
4. `GET /api/tasks` if the user is being redirected back to the overview page

This means there's a total of 4 HTTP requests in that flow, and that isn't really ""too many"".

Sure, you can prevent the 4th call from happening by storing the results of (1) in the `localStorage` and updating it when an update happens. But that requires additional logic to keep the `localStorage` and the backend ""synchronized"". If that synchronisation is buggy, you might give your users a weird user experience, where data doesn't appear to be updating.

You could also prevent the 2nd call from happening, but that largely depends on what additional information is being retrieved in the `GET /api/tasks/1` call that isn't available in the `GET /api/tasks` call. If there's a lot of additional information, or if retrieving the data might be more costly, then keeping those calls separate is the right call. If the users are visiting the application through a mobile device, any increase in payload may decrease the performance significantly. The only solution here is to benchmark those API calls and to draw conclusions afterwards.

But honestly, I don't see an issue with those API calls. If these API calls are slow right now, you may want to implement paged calls to your API, such as `GET /api/tasks?offset=0&limit=50`.

But more often you update the less of a snowball it becomes. Angular team always posts ""what's new"" in releases and that is great source of information. For example: with latest Angular CLI and NG5.1, you can push your typescript to 2.5.x., Typescript 2.6.x is not yet endorsed by Angular team.
How do you know which version to use? That depends on your project. But my personal general rule is to maximize the use of each library/module/dependency and minimize the number of dependencies. (though admittedly not easy to do sometimes) Lots and lots of testing and when dependency is the source of your problem, lot's of googling.",1514411558.0

There is a guy, Max some long German name, who is an amazing instructor.  I don't know if his courses have been updated for recent Angular versions.  He had courses on one of the big name online techie schools, Udemy or whatever.

The real issue is that I found reactive functional programming really hard to understand for a long time.  I was never a programmer but could hack PHP, JavaScript, and some older stuff to get some functionality.  I loved OOP.  The learning curve for reactive programming is really steep but just do it and don't look back.

Angular has been changing a LOT.  When you do Google searches don't look back more than a year and 6 months or less is better.  One of the big problems now is that a lot of courseware is outdated.  Vasco keeps Angular University really current.  Most others don't.  In the Tools menu in Google search you can select dates.  Use it.  I frequently don't want to see anything older than Angular 4, which is the beginning of stability.

I've been into Angular since about Feb 2016 when it was in alpha stage and it has been a very challenging experience - and I have been playing around with coding since 1977 in Fortran on punch cards and Basic.

",1514201394.0
tme321,"So AlDrag touched on some of this but I'll explain it as well and hopefully provide some further insight.

First, to use a bad metaphor, think of using observables as creating pipes, almost but not quite entirely unlike water pipes, where you have an input on one end and any number of outputs on the other.

A subject is the input end of the pipe.  That's where you pass new items into the pipe so that eventually they can be seen in the output.

Observables themselves are sections of this pipe that do different things both to the values moving through the pipe and on how the flow through the pipe works as well.

Subscribing to any observable along the way creates an output from the stream up to that point (all the observable operators ""behind"" the subscribe point) to see these values as they come out.

So what you probably want is first a subject of some kind to add new values to.  The most important thing to understand when starting with subjects is hot vs cold behavior.  

Hot subjects mean that the data is continuously flowing through them at the rate that the data is added.  They *do not* wait for a subscriber output.

Cold observables hold the data for each new subscriber so that each time a new subscription is made *some* of the data will be seen by the subscriber even if the subscription didn't happen until after the new item was added to the subject.  How much of *some* data is a matter of what type of subject you use.

A base subject is hot.  So if you tell it to emit a value and no one is listening yet then that value is basically lost.  If you have 2 subscribers on the stream and emit an item then both will see it.  If you add a 3rd subscriber after the value was emitted the new 3rd subscriber will not see the data.  But any later values you push through the pipe will then be seen by all 3 subscribers.

*Usually* you will instead want to use either a behavior subject or replay subject.  Both are cold so any time a new subscriber starts listening they will get something as soon as they subscribe.

A behavior subject will basically store the last item that was emitted and any new subscribers will only get that last value.  This is *generally* the most useful one but it's not always the behavior you want.

A replay subject is told how many items you want it to replay.  So if you instantiate it with a value of 3 then any new subscribers will see the 3 most recent emissions.  Or less if 3 things haven't been emitted yet.  But up to 3.  A replay subject of 1 is identical to a behavior subject except that a behavior subject *has* to be instantiated with the initial value.  A replay subject needs no initial value.  Both behaviors, again, can be very useful depending on the use case.

If you use a behavior subject you can make its initial value be some sort of default or empty data structure that is in the same shape as your component is expecting so that it's not trying to access keys that don't exist and getting back either nulls or even throwing null exceptions for nested data.

A replay subject can be used instead where you don't want a default or initial value.  Instead the components will just wait until they actually see a value come down the observable.  Before that they just won't render any parts that rely on the data yet because it doesn't exist.  Note that this state is different from sending a null through an observable.  Sending a null *is a value*.  It's the null value.  Not sending a value is different.  It literally means there's no value to read, null or otherwise.

Finally, since you are taking about fetching that means you are probably doing http requests.  Assuming that's the case most likely you'll want to make the subject that actually emits observables of data and then immediately attach a flatmap operator to the end of the subject.  You can see [an example of that](https://github.com/tme321/HttpObservablesRecipes/blob/master/src/app/http-services/pipeline-observable/pipeline-observable.service.ts) here.  Basically what it means is your initial subject actually emits inner observables (calls to http.get) and then flatmap goes into that inner observable and extracts the data it actually contains (the response) and then sends the data along, removing that inner observable.

So yeah, that should get you started at least.",1514122134.0
AlDrag,"It sounds like you want a HOT observable? Therefore your theItem variable should actually be a subject.

What I'd do (not necessarily the best approach) would be setup a private subject variable and a public observable variable. In the constructor assign the observable variable to equal the subject (subjects return observables). Then when your fetch comes through, use the subjects .next(). Should all be in sync.

Edit: You could use a BehaviorSubject or a ReplaySubject instead of a standard subject if you want to always return the latest value straight away on subscribe.",1514114341.0

You don't need `userService.isAuth = false` in your first test because you've already set it to false in your stub. So you simply call `detectChanges()` to trigger data propagation to the DOM and state your test.

In the second test, you must wait until *after* you've updated your `isAuth` value to call `detectChanges()`. If you do it before, it'll use your stub value which causes your test to fail.

This should illustrate the point:

    it('should display ""Welcome"" the user if he is logged', () => {

      fixture.detectChanges()
      userService.isAuth = false

But the `DatePipe` is really efficient, so I wouldn't worry too much about performance until it becomes a problem. One way to solve it would be to manually format it in your component class:

    import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-date-stuff',

      formatted: string[];

      constructor(private datePipe: DatePipe) { }

      ngOnInit() {
        this.formatted = this.datePipe.transform(new Date(), 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss').split(' ');

For data heavy tables I use ag-Grid. Then I use several stand-alone helper components. Usually you need to mix several libs anyway. I find Angular Material not very intuitve to use - that time I was frustated by the dialog, table and the customization. Using your own color scheme is quite an operation. Also, things like the multi-select are not designed very well (what if you have a list of 60 items? User needs to scroll through and uncheck?). But you should give it a fair try yourself. I might be a bit thick from time to time.

Bulma.io is very easy to customize, has great layout helpers and basically css for all components you might wish for (there are additions as well, e.g. for a stepper).

However, you need to bring this css to life. As you need to get fluent with Angular anyway, that is not that much a problem. E.g. for an autocomplete you have to manage the state the standard Angular way - like ""isOpen"", ""completionList"", ""currentText"" ... all doable.

Another thing to be aware is that Angular Material handles some advanced scenarios (look at the CDK).

second: create directive to show or hide buttons based on permission

e.g.
    <button [featureCheck]=""addNewUser"">Add User</button>

,[deleted],1513111571.0
tme321,"So fundamentally what you need is some sort of signal when a particular element is in view.

If we use [this fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/cse_tushar/Dxtyu/141/) as a basic example you can see in the onScroll callback this conditional statement is what is determining when a particular section is ""active"":

      if (refElement.position().top <= scrollPos 
            && refElement.position().top + 
            refElement.height() > scrollPos) {

So I would wrap check that inside a directive that you add to the outer element that represents each section.  Then I would use an observable to monitor the event and use denounce so that you aren't hammering on scroll.   You'll need to inject elementRef into the directive to get a reference to the element that will be checked.

I would use an injectable service to orchestrate all the in view directives with a single scroll event listener so you aren't creating a bunch of scroll event listeners unnecessarily.

So a basic implementation would be something like:

    @Injectable()
    class InViewService {
        inView$;  

        inViewDirectives: InViewDirective[] = [];

        constructor() {
            this.inView$ = fromEvent(document, 'scroll').pipe(
                 debounce(50), // so we don't hammer with every event
                 map(setInView)
            ).subscribe();
        }

        setInView(e: ScrollEvent) {
            this.inViewDirectives.forEach(d =>
                d.isInView = e.scrollTop()
             );
        }

        register(d: InViewDirective) {
            this.inViewDirectives.push(d);
        }
    }

    @Directive({
         selector:""in-view"",
         host: {
             '[class.active]':""inView""
          }
    })
    class InViewDirective {
        inView: boolean;

        constructor(private ele: ElementRef,
            private inViewServ: InViewService) {}

        ngOnInit() {
            this.inViewServ.register(this);
        }

        set isInView(scrollPos: number) {
             this.inView =  this.ele.position().top <= scrollPos 
            && this.ele.position().top + 
            this.ele.height() > scrollPos;
         }
    }

So the service monitors the scroll event and each time it fires every directive that has registered will be notified with the scroll top call from the service.  It then calculates if it is in view using the same check that that fiddle used.  Then it's just a host binding to the active class for the result of that check.

This is just a rough sketch.  Among other things you should probably add in a way to unregister the directives and have that tied to ngOnDestroy inside the directives.  And you might want to use a different calculation or whatever.  Also you'll want to hold the subscription inside the service and have a way to unsubscribe from the scroll event observable when the service isn't being used for the current page.  And possibly you might want to calculate the scroll position differently, I just copied that naive one from a random fiddle.

But that's the basic idea and should be enough to get you started.",1513112055.0
NuttGuy,"I think the issue that you're running into is that you're storing the Observable that is returned from this.http.get. Observables from http.get will only emit one value, and then be completed, so even if you store an instance of that Observable and return it from your function, it won't emit another value because it was already completed.

Instead, you should have a defined Subject be a property of your Service like:

    private dataCache = new ReplaySubject(1);
    public data = this.dataCache.asObservable();

Then, when you make your http call it should look something like:

    public getData() {
      this.http.get(`/data`).subscribe(res => this.dataCache.onNext(res);
    }

dataCache will be around as long as your Service is, and since it's  a ReplaySubject, with a buffer of 1, it won't complete just after returning one time, and will store the last thing emitted to it. Now in your Component code you just have to do:

    ngOnInit() {
      this.dataService.getData();
      this.dataService.data.subscribe(...);
    }

Any subsequent subscribes to this.dataService.data, won't make another http call, only if you re-call to this.dataService.getData(). ",1513108328.0
tme321,"Combine the http observable with an ID observable representing the id you want to filter on.  

Here I'm going to use a sentinel value of -1 id just to have a value that will return no items, the initial state.  There are multiple ways to handle the initial state so I just chose this one at random since you didn't specify exactly how that should work.

More or less something like:

    class CatService  {
        filteredCategories$;
        id$ = new BehaviorSubject(-1);

        constructor(http) {
            let data$ = http.get(...);
            this.filteredCategories$ = data$.pipe(
                combineLatest(id$),
                map(state=>filterCategories(...state)));
        }

        filterCategories(catData: Categories[], id: number) {
            return catData.filter(cat=>cat.id === id);
        }

        setCategoryID(id: number) {
            this.id$.next(id);
        }
    }

Then when you inject that service and subscribe to catServ.filteredCategories$ each time you call catServ.setCategoryID it will emit the result of the mapping operation again with a new id and the same http result.

fan-man,"good job! I can really see this project taking off.

biggest things I noticed:

- on smart phone, portrait view is a bit tight when looking at the ""all words"" section. If your longest Chinese character combination is 2, then you have about 11 char length on the pinyin column, leaving you more margin to allow the definition to be more visible.

- again with the ""all words"" section, noticed that the pinyin has tone marks but the pinyin for the counting characters do not. If this is coming directly off the remote source, you can probably fix using a pipe (not a service pipe, the | )

something you can do right now that would be a neat feature:

- you can have a component that randomly selects a vocabulary word from each level and display it in a flashcard view.

as a linguist, some things I would hope to see, only because they would've helped me when i tested:

- vocabulary words used in context
- newspaper patterns
- 四字成语 / 普遍成语 (sorry for the Chinese, i just feel the Chinese expresses itself better than just saying ""Chinese sayings"", especially since the 4 character ones are probably the most challenging to decipher when dealing with a wall of text / a passage of listening.
- characters commonly used in phonetics with examples (i.e. 哦巴马总统）
- common abbreviations (中国人民代表大会 vs 大会 or 北京大学 vs 北大）

bahmutov,"Hi, author of the blog here. Sorry I skipped over this part.

Here is our trick: NPM module https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-parallel to start the server, start Cypress and then close the server when the tests finish.

    ""test"": ""run-p --race start e2e""

The above command ""run-p"" comes from npm-run-parallel and stands for ""run in parallel"" (with race flag).

Sometimes starting the server takes a long time, for example if it is building the site. In that case we recommend our tool https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test

    {
      ""scripts"": {
        ""start-server"": ""npm start"",
        ""test"": ""mocha e2e-spec.js"",
        ""ci"": ""start-server-and-test start-server http://localhost:8080 test""
      }
    }

The above ""ci"" command runs NPM command ""start"", waits until the server at :8080 responds, runs the NPM command ""test"" and then shuts down the server.

You can see these commands in action in our documentation site https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/blob/0e27826260a928aaa02e13061a0bedbabcf25308/package.json#L33

When the component gets destroyed the takeUntil gets triggered and the subscription is destroyed.

lazarljubenovic,"There are a couple of places that you might want to poke at to see if you could gain performance boost when dealing with large lists of complex elements.

I'll order from simplest (but possibly not effective enough) to most difficult (but probably very effective).

- The easiest thing to fix is to utilize the `trackBy` function for `NgFor`. If your items have some sort of unique IDs (in practice this is usually the case; an ID from your database is a great fit), use it for tracking your items. Do not use their index in the array.
- Next, `ngFor`  is using the default differ which might be overly-complex for a usual case because it's designed to handle a lot of edge-cases. Providing your own differ could drastically boost a performance of a page with a long list of often-changing items.
- And since we're talking about items that change often, you might not want to actually change items that are outside of the viewport, but lazily update them as user beings to scroll. This adds some complexity to your code for sure, but it's surely going to be worth it (if done correctly).
- Others have already implied this, but it doesn't hurt to repeat that virtualization is probably what you're after. You should not render longs lists if most of it will never be visible at the same time to the user.",1512902688.0

The only downside to this approach is that I tend to have very long file names, but in the end it doesn't really matter if you rarely look at them.

For filtering the approach of using a flag and reading the flags in the selector for the state is usually the best.  In rare circumstances it can make sense to also do the filter as part of the observable chain after the store select.

8wallace8,"tme321 solution will work, but if your app grows and you would like to separate sidenav and footer into different components then you could create a Service to control the sidenavs.

      public toggleSidenavLeft: EventEmitter<any> = new EventEmitter();
      public toggleSidenavRight: EventEmitter<any> = new EventEmitter();
    }
    // It's important to remember that Services are singletons, so provide only in a core.module 
    // or in the app.module or your components could possibly have different instances of LayoutService.

Inject and Subscribe to your service in the sidenav component:

    @ViewChild(""sidenavLeft"") sidenavLeft: MatSidenav
    @ViewChild(""sidenavRight"") sidenavRight: MatSidenav

    constructor(public layoutService: LayoutService){
      this.layoutService.toggleSidenavLeft.subscribe(() => {

tme321,"The #foo syntax are template variables.  When you define a #variable in the template it can be references in other places on the template and can also be read in the controller with ViewChild.

I don't see it documented anywhere but they do export the component through the exportAs field in the [component decorator](https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/src/lib/sidenav/sidenav.ts).  That means that if you reference that in the template like 

    <mat-side-nav #sideNav=""matSideNav"">

Then now you have a reference to the mat side nav controller called sideNav.  

Then in the controller for the component you wrote that is displaying the side nav you can get that variable by doing

    @ViewChild('sideNav') sideNav: MatSidenav;

So now you have a reference to the controller of the material side nav component.  At that point you can wire it up with whatever methods it exposes.  The mat side nav component extends mat drawer and mat drawer has a setter for opened(boolean) and also a toggle() method.  Either one of those looks like they can be called to open and close the side nav.

So then it's just a matter of wiring up a button.  In the template something like:

    <button (click)=""onClick()""></>

And in the controller where you already got a reference to side nav:

    onClick() {
        this.sideNav.toggle()

You generally shouldn't be testing angular.  Angular has its own tests that, supposedly, must pass before the team releases a new version.

tme321,"The providers statements are creating a dependency injection graph.  Basically any time a particular service is asked for, by specificying it in the constructors parameters, Angular's di system will crawl this graph up from the point of instantiation until it finds the first provider statement that satisfies the symbol it is looking for.

So I'm sure there are more but I can think of 2 common use cases where you wouldn't want to just provide a service at the root level.

1.  When you want to use the di system to inject a different version of the service depending on what part of the app the service is being injected into.  For instance I wrote a component that is a customized option select with text input attached.  Select2 I believe is the common name.  The component is generic and a service you define for injecting controls it by providing the list in whatever manner it chooses.  So in one part of the app the service injected might have it hit an endpoint for a list of countries and another part of the app uses the same component to display a list of cities.  With dependency injection I abstract away the way the component gets the data and can inject the countries service in one part of the app and the cities service in another.  Same component, 2 services with the same shape, di controls which version of the service the component is actually using.

2.  Using services as state containers each instance of a component might need it's own state.  Services default to singletons from the point of the provider statement.  So if the service is only provided in the root module all the components will be sharing the same state.  And that's probably not what you want.  So instead the component itself has a providers statement for the service so that each instance of the component will get its own version of the state container, not a single instance shared between them.  This can also be done by providing a factory in place of directly providing the service but the end result is basically the same so both techniques could potentially be used depending on the case.

So for services that are just doing 1 specific task and are stateless?  Yes those can just be provided in the root module.  For services that specifically need to be overridden or services that are holding state and not meant to be shared you have to provide them in different places to achieve the desired functionality.",1512329288.0

Framework vs Library
Angular it's a framework, with everything which we need for big project. For example projects build with react can produce lot on discussions about choosing third party libraries like which xhr libriary is suitable for the project and it waste of time (fetch vs axios vs etc).

Typescript.
We can use flow for react, but it not mandatory for libraries, but typescript is mandatory for libraries and it gives lot of benefits.

tme321,"First, I highly recommend defining state as pure data objects not as classes that self mutate.  There are a lot of reasons for this but basically it's a model that works well with the front end, rxjs, and one of the state libraries like ngrx should you ever decide to use one.

Having said that I think it's a good pattern to then wrap management of that pure data state object inside a service, basically acting as a view model.  So I think your on the right track there.  Services as state are usually referred to as state containers in angular so you can Google that for examples and ideas.

As for whether the services can be made public allowing direct placement on the template I honestly pretty much agree with you that having to redeclare a state containers fields as public getters in the component controller isn't as useful as proponents make it out to be.  But the alternative is making the service itself public in order to bind it to the template and I don't care for that.  So generally I just end up defining public getters even though I agree it's kind of nonsense.

Nanopants,"I think it's helpful to come with a familiarity with MVVM, but I would suggest leaving microsoft's pattern behind and doing things the Angular way.  There's nothing wrong with using dependency injection, and I've seen projects using a shared ""data service.""  Simplifying the model can cut down on the effort of serializing a structure to be transmitted to the back-end, or updating many components based on a complex aggregate received, and simpler is better in my opinion.  

The only drawback I know of, is that a model shared among components might possibly promote ""chatter"" in an unpredictable way, which could otherwise be limited through data binding between parent and child components.

In my view, the ideal is to have the Component concentrate purely on the UI - using Reactive Forms is a great way to be able to model the view directly, and so html becomes just the 'paint'
Complex business logic can then be put into the ViewModel service that is injected into the Component at runtime; this ViewModel is then responsible (probably via a data service) to retrieve and store the Model data.
As mlapis mentions below, it is important to differentiate between smart components and pure presentation components - i.e. a component that is essentially a date picker does not need a viewmodel!

The function returned by `handleError` doesn't need to be tied down to a specific type for this empty return value, so it is bound to the generic type `T`.
