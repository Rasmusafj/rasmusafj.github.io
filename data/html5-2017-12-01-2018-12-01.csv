In HTML 5 you could do that, I think the value for the status would need to be returned from a database query. Alternatively you could do this with javascript as well, but that's the HTML 5 css-tricks tutorial on the idea, just plug the values for the progress position in, using whatever server language you are using. So in your case with 4 values, a max of 100 could be something like 0 for received, 25 for in progress, 50 for testing, 75 for shipped, 100 for delivered. Possibly adding sometype of pretty label or label indications for those positions. ",1543424048.0

The ePub spec explicitly states that it is built on the HTML spec, so no fragmentation has occurred on the spec side. Readers, like browsers, tend to add their own features and most importantly DRM. Digital Rights Management is what is causing fragmentation.

Boldewyn,"Tl;dr: No, not without a lot of work-arounds.

There _are_ options, but they all have drawbacks / require some work / have sketchy browser support / ...

1. The classic: Put the header in an `<iframe>`. To have header links change the whole page, add `target=""_parent""` to any `<a>` in the header.

2. The “wasn’t there something in the spec about scoped CSS?” solution: Put your CSS in a `<style scoped>` element and place it _inside_ the header / container, that should have the styles applied. Disadvantage: The feature was deprecated and isn’t supported in any browser anymore.

    **Edit:** 2a. Use JS libraries, that have `<style scoped>` support, namely [Vue](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/scoped-css.html). Disadvantage: Some kB of JS only for this feature and you bind yourself to a JS framework and its toolset.

3. The “OK then. Let’s scope it manually” [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45692033/113195): Give an ID to each of the header and the container, then do a regex search ’n replace in the CSS files to prefix all selectors with the appropriate ID. Disadvantages: CSS will become larger, `body .foo` selectors might become `#header body .foo` and not matching anything, any styles from a common stylesheet will most probably lose the specificity battle.

4. The newcomer: Scoped styles in Shadow DOMs. That solution needs JS, though. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) for an intro. Basic gist: Remake one of your components into a web component and load the CSS into its Shadow DOM for scoping. More or less just a fancy `<iframe>` variant.",1538597437.0
zorndyuke,"In this case you have to split the needed parts in logical files and only include what you need.  

If it's really not combineable, then simply create another class with the same style. It may be the same properties, but you have the flexibility to change things without risking breaking other stylings.  

Usually you can create a semantic class, which can be used on multiple places or you have an element/modifier that has specific rules for a specific structure.  

> conflicting fonts  

This could be a good modifier class, like `.content--modernize` which includes things line font, font-size, font-weight adjustments.  

Let's say you want your text look like barock timeline, so you use [Barock Font](https://www.wfonts.com/font/feinsliebchen-barock), so you have something like `.content-barockize`, which adds everything necessary. Don't name the class `.font-barock` or similiar. There is a reason why you shouldn't be using inline styling and naming classes like the css rule is a similiar bad practice.  

Always describe the property, don't specify it. [Read this for more](https://css-tricks.com/semantic-class-names/).  
Your goal is to never touch the HTML-structure again. If the structure and classes are semantic, you never should have the need to touch the HTML.  

I love the `class=""left""` example. If you want the text to appear on the right, you now can't simply change the css class property, but you need to change the html class name. Why? Because the used class name is specifing it's styling, not describing it. Describing it like `class=""quote""`, you can simply decide if you want:  

> This is a Quote  
> ~ by zorndyuke  

or just adjust the CSS (not the HTML!) and have  

> ---------------------This is a Quote  
> ----------------------~ by zorndyuke

Luke-At-UCS,"[You can put a `pattern` attribute on an `input`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#attr-pattern). For example, a text field that only accepts uppercase, two letter abbreviations might look like this:

    <input type=""text"" pattern=""[A-Z]{2}"" />

You don't need javascript for it and you can style error states with CSS using `:invalid`. For example:

    <label for=""state"">
      State: 
      <input id=""state"" required pattern=""[A-Z]{2}"" />

It scales to webpage size, and you can set it like 70 or 80vw for a more full page feel. I would use either a @media query or a separate linkage of another CSS sheet. For example: 

`<link href=""480.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"" media=""screen and (max-width: 480px) and (min-width: 150px)/>` 

Let's say you have three images across in a container. They're flex objects, set flex-direction: row; I would set 

img {

  width: 30vw;

}

and then in your 

@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {

img {

  width: 75vw;

}

This tells the browser to render the image as almost full screen for mobile devices but large, clear, but a normal size for one image in a row on a desktop. If you want it big on both, just set the normal img call in style.css to 70 or 80vw. Hope this helps!

Earhacker,"It's possible, and fairly common, to build an attractive, standards-compliant, static website with just HTML and CSS. But such websites are static; they never change and have very little user interaction beyond just clicking links.

To build a website with user interaction, i.e. a web *app* rather than web *site*, you need JavaScript. JavaScript is the only programming language which works in the browser. Every web app you use - Facebook, Gmail, the new Reddit, Spotify - they're all browser apps built with JavaScript. You can build a web app with ""vanilla"" JavaScript (and you totally should, it's a good learning exercise) but in industry, developers are more likely to use a JavaScript framework or library such as React, Angular or jQuery (which is a little outdated now).

That takes care of the web app *client*, i.e. everything that the user sees. But web apps will most commonly do the bulk of their processing and data handling on a *server.* The server is also responsible for making the actual HTML, CSS and JS files available to the client. A server-side app is more than likely capable of generating HTML dynamically. Imagine you have a blog. You wouldn't write a new HTML file for each blog post. You'd end up with dozens of HTML files, and most of their contents would be repeated every time (the same header and footer, the same navbar...). It's a much better idea to write *one* HTML file for your blog posts, and make the server dynamically change the content of the HTML file depending on which blog post the user wants to read.

PHP is a language designed for exactly this. PHP is really good at fetching data from a database (probably MySQL) and generating HTML content from it. Again, you can do this with plain ol' PHP, but you're more likely to do it with a framework like WordPress, Laravel or Symfony.

But these days, any language at all can do the ""fetch data, build HTML"" job of PHP. Python has the Flask and Django frameworks, Ruby has Rails and Sinatra, Java has Spark and Spring, C# has .NET MVC... You can even do it with JavaScript, with the Express framework for Node.

So to answer your question of what languages to learn, it really makes no difference. You'll need HTML, CSS and at least a little bit of JavaScript. That's a lot to learn and definitely enough to start looking for internships and entry level jobs. And every software developer will at some point in their career be asked to write some HTML, CSS and JS. But for the actual guts of your web app, your language choice really makes no difference.

pNaN,"The other guys are right, but their examples might be a bit convoluted.

I also thought requestAnimationFrame (raf) was hard to understand to begin with, but then I ""grokked"" it. It's actually quite simple. It will separate math from animation. You can still do math outside of the function, but anything that moves any element should be pushed through raf. So it's easier on the browser,

So imagine if you got an element moving from x-axis position -200px, to position 0 in 300 ms.(silly, yes, use css transition instead) You can do it with an interval, which would calculate and position the element for every tick. But the browser can't paint your application that fast. If you push it, it will look sluggish.

Introducting **raf**!

you can still do math (which doesn't cost much) but the actual animation (which costs a lot) doesn't trigger unless the browser has room for it. The way to use it, is to make the function calling **raf** recursively call itself.

    // ----------------------------------------------------
    // untested pseudocode
    // ----------------------------------------------------

    let myX = 0;             // this is just a variable

    function setNewX() {
        myX = doSomeMath();  // change that one variable
        myAnim();            // a call to the browser to start the animation
    }

    function myAnim() {
        requestAnimationFrame( moveElem ); //calls moveElem when the browser is ready
    }

    function moveElem() {
        moveElemX( myX );   // moves the actual element to the variable
        myAnim();           // recursive call to another raf

You’re building a local news channel website and on the home page there’s a section with the weather forecast, and an article that is the 3 day forecast and each day is also an article. If each day were structured as an independent article, it could then be used in the 3 day, 7 day, and long term forecast, but also be used in the banner across the top of the page showing today’s forecast only.

If you are generating these 1 day weather forecast items programmatically, the article element makes even more sense as an article allows for symantic children like header, section, and footer elements that can be displayed differently depending on parent context. Having “rain” not be tied to the date in a sibling header element means that reusing the element containing “rain” elsewhere relies on exterior logic/knowledge in order to give it any context.

I mean I remember when I used more Divs than I actually needed back then too, but only because I didn't knew it better.  

Nowadays you can do so much with way less divs.   

There is not really a max of it, but you should take into account that every character is a byte of code that someone has to download. If a mobile user has to load 100mb of data before entering your page with his 3G phone, you can be sure to loose this users permanently from your website.  

Also bots like the Google crawler will hate you and score you negative for having a way too bad code/text ratio.  

The more you learn about HTML/CSS, the less you need. It's not the quantity that matters, but the quality.  

Imagine a website beeing a set of Boxes. Yes, the boxes Amazon uses to store your stuff.  

The first big box is the Browser's viewport. Everything under the adressbar and everything where the website can be in. The <html>/<body> part if you want so.  

Now for everything you want to place on your website, you probally want to add another box and into this boxes can fit more smaller boxes. And each box can fit his own smaller box.  
The question is always: Do I need this extra box around my other boxes or can I do it without?

Now again, I don't know for certain. 

https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/paypal-payments-standard/integration-guide/formbasics/

_s-xclick - The button that the person clicked was protected from tampering by using encryption, or the button was saved in the merchant's PayPal account. PayPal determines which kind of button was clicked by decoding the encrypted code or by looking up the saved button in the merchant's account

_cart  - For shopping cart purchases. 
The following variables specify the kind of shopping cart button that the person clicked:

* add — Add to Cart buttons for the PayPal Shopping Cart

* display — View Cart buttons for the PayPal Shopping Cart

* upload — The Cart Upload command for third-party carts

zorndyuke,"You can't do it perfectly.  

You can ""rightclick and save"" the website, saving everything which also creates a folder with images etc.  

In the end it's just a more or less bad version saved. There are probally also some tools that copy everything recursive.  

In the long run I wouldn't recommend you doing that. Not because copyright infringements, but because that what you copy can never be as good if you do it your self.  

If you really like a template, then plain code it your self. It's not really hard. You have to see a website as a collection of boxes.  

You have one big Amazon box from which contained your 100"" tube screen (let's say that this exists..). It's a huge empty box and you now have an long box which container a 99"" Plasma screen. You see.. while tube screens are like rectangulars, Plasma screens have a long width, but short height.  

The good thing is that you can put the box of the Plasma Screen into the box from the Tube Screen. Now you have an empty box from your Sneekers. It's way smaller, but hey, it fits into the Plasma Scren Box ;)  

Repeat that with other boxes until you have the arrangement you want (the HTML structure of your website) and then you can start decorating it.. you can color one box, you can stick a picture on one of the boxes.. and more things (thats the CSS part).  

Last step would be adjusting the boxes to react to specfic actions.. (javascript)  

It looks way harder than it is. The only thing that is hard is taking your time and doing some researches. If you once understand the core behind it, HTML+CSS is easy as fuck. The only thing left is the experience.. the experience to know ""Aahh okey,.. these two elements have some special behaviour.. okey if I do this, then I can get this or at least I tricked it to act like it"" etc.  

You don't have to be a professional for that. Just do it step by step. Like I said.. imagine everything as boxes.  

Let's look at the Reddit page.  

Start first the first Box. It's the very top small box with all the subreddits you did abo.  

""My subreddits  - Main - Popular - All - Random - Friends - Users | .....""  

What is that? Well, we start with the first box.. ok. We already did the top bar. We don't even need another box, we now can start to style. We say that the height of the bar is 18px long and that the background is this type of grey.  

Now we add the anchor elements (let's ignore ""my subreddits"" for the first, because it's using Javascript to open the navigation) `<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/"">Main page</a>` Now we have a clickable wording that saying ""Main Page"". Clicking on it will lead to the main page. Repeat that with every other anchor elements like ""Popular, All, Random, etc"".  

That's it. You successfully finished step 1. The very first box. Continue! Box #2 is the blue area. First we add the box. Ok, what's inside this box? There is the Reddit HTML5 Logo, the anchor ""HTML5"" and ""Comments"", also on the right side there is another box where some user data is found.  

Your best weapon to analyse and see how a website is build, is ""Right click -> Inspect element"". It will open the Developer Tools and automatically hover the HTML part which you inspected. If you inspected the HTML5 logo, you will see that an <image>-Tag was used (within an Anchor element, so clicking on it will redirect you to the other page). Image tags are like boxes, but they automatically add the image you inserted within the ""src"" part within the box. In this example, the HTML5 logo was inserted.  
That's it.. you have inserted the Logo. Don't struggle for the position or the styling.. do that after you added the structure. Always think like you will build up a structure and build your styling around it. The plan is that you never ever have to touch the HTML again, but only the styling. That's the way how semantic websites are build. Of course there are many ways to Rome, but let's take the beginner friendly way. You can do you researches like semantic websites when you are advanced or if you want do it immediatly, so you learn the right way.  

Next two things are the anchor elements ""HTML5"" and ""Comments"". Bam, the left side is already finished! What's left? The right side with user information. Like I said, ignore styling for the first. Just add another box `<div></div>` and start.. anchor element ""your username (karma)"" then a Pipe "" | "", then another image element with the ""src"" property using an url that is an envelop. Another image that looks like a chat symbol (there is a chance that you don't have this feature.. I am not sure if this globaly active). Next Anchor ""Settings"", another Pipe and last anchor element ""Logout"".  

NOW you can start styling. First box hast blue background and a height of 69px. ""HTML5"" is bold. ""Comments"" have a white background, red font color, bold font, small padding of 6px (left/right) and 2px to the top/bottom. Just do the inspect element thing and look at the very right in the developer tools. You see every CSS that is applied to it. Instead just an anchor element, they using unsorted list elements, so they need some other css properties too, you will learn that or should ""step by step"" learn it.  

I mean.. you have a list of items. This list of items are just ""HTML5"" and ""Comments"". You don't need them, but it's easier to style, because you now need a basic CSS rule for list items and then you can add more and more list items which automatically have the correct stylings ;)  

Last styling is the last box, th right side box. Another blue-ish background, bottom-left corder is like 50%.. that's it. Ah yea and the fact that it's at the right side.  

Bam, finished!  I know the second step looked bigger and longer, but just to read/write, because it was more than one element. Coding is much easier and also just steps you have to go [One By One](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/The_Darkness).  

The good thing is.. after you finished a box, you theoretically can't destroy it.",1523362985.0

First, can you provide any more details about exactly the platform you're working with, and the hardware available?

My first thought was, do you need 1700 canvases? Why not just use 1 canvas, and draw on it what you need to draw on it.

If that's not possible, here's another idea. You said:

> The animation function checks the offsetWidth of the target canvas first to make sure it's visible before spending any time animating it, but even that check done 1700 times per animation tick adds up.

If your canvases are divided into 16 groups, it sounds like you only need to make 16 checks, not 1700. If the group isn't visible on-screen, neither are the canvases in that group (put them in a container of some kind).",1521583750.0
madwill,"Yeah it really feels like 1700 canvas is not the way to go. You only need as many canvas as there are currently displayed on screen.

But as others said you should keep the number of tags to what is visible (the maximum).


Also, here are few tips if I may.

When you create a canvas in general it's to do some drawing operations. If you are not doing ""animated stuff"" then you just need one offscren canvas, do your opérations in, then save the blob and load the blob in images.


So you should have 16 images in the DOM (if I understand well), 1 offscreen canvas (not in the DOM, you just care about context), and you can cache blobs or redrawing each blobs each times (if it's just 16 draws, it's still better than caching 1700 blobs in memory).


Then you update your img tags src with blobs :)",1523872587.0

zorndyuke,"If you all have problems with sleep or wants some special soul massage, you should try out if you are able to get triggered by ASMR triggers.  

ASMR is more or less videos that makes sounds and/or visual effects in many different ways. Many people are actually having a very nice feeling like a brain massage while listening or watching a ASMR video.  

There are tons of material and everyone will have their own preferences, so if you like something like ""tapping"", then you can search for just tappings.  

Here are some Youtubers that I personally love to listen:  

- anoASMR  
- MassageASMR  
- asmr zeitgeist  
- Jojo's ASMR  
- Dr. T ASMR  
- (ask if you want some more or just search for your self)   

Here are some triggers that many people like:  

- mouth sounds  
- fast asmr  
- water splashing  
- inaudible whisper/words  
- hand sounds  
- ear kissing/licking  
- sketching  
- haircuts (sound of scissors)  
- slime sounds  


P.S. Warning! If you are new to this, the content creators may look crazy for you and you will be like ""WHAT... THE.. FUCK!?"". But just have an open ear.. take your headphones, relax, just listen to them and maybe you will triggered too and have many good times. :-)

zorndyuke,"I am not sure what you are aiming for.. money or if you really trying to educate people, but neither of these goals are helpful with your approach.  

It's obviously that you write down 1:1 from another source. Noone, not even the elite of coders, are writing code like that. You can't just plain start doin CSS without even planing and writing down a structure, but you are already doing advanced styling that need at least one refresh of the side so you can see the actual state of the website. With enough experience you can pre-write a few of them on your own, that is possible, but not everything.  

Also you pre-write JS functions that you will create in the future. Even JS pro's have to stop, think, plan and test, but not just plain write everything perfect with seeing in the future.  

Best video was still where you actually spoke and then had a typo in it and you needed like forever to check what you did wrong instead of proper debugging like even amateurs do.  

By far this comment is not to burn you. It's you hold on your eyes that you not helping, but damaging beginners with this. You should be an example for beginner, not a magician. Beginner will feel discouraged, unmotivaded and general have a bad feeling, because they think they this is normal, what by far is not. You also not really explaining what is going on. Why you doing that and what's the purpose behind that all. Every question a beginner ""want"" to know and not just plain copy.  

I insist that you either stop it or take way more engagement to make these ""guides"" or you will be nothing else than a negative property. The question is: Do you want other people calling your name with negative content? Like people calling w3schools as a bad source, because they did lazy and wrong work. They seem to not care at all, but they only stand with their website behind. You stay with your name behind and imagine you want to search a work and the PR at the place is googling for you and only finding bad reviews about you and your online ""tuts"".  

I watched a video yesteday, a very inspirational. It was about how a Dad, who left at three grade, who is ""just"" a cook, is doing every possible step to be an example.  
He would always go 15min earlier to everything that he planned. To the question why he is doing that he said:""If my kids every see me doing that, they would see that as a perfect example and act according to that."" The same will happen with your guides. If they see that you are coding like that, they will try the same and fail which will lead to bad motivation.  

Try watching other tutorials and what they do different. Try acting like a beginner who is watching that. Like if you can't even code and you watching the Guide called ""How to code XXX"". What would you want to know? Which questions would come on your mind?""  

I would do guides my self too, but I know that I wouldn't put enough effort into it and wouldn't deliver a good enough quality. So I am trying to get better soft skills in this kind of topic and when I have enough experience, I will start some guides too. But currently I wouldn't be a help. My English is broken, I tend to do crazy comparisons, I am very emotional, I tend to digress from the topic I was about to talk and few others things. Try the same.

It's basically a list of invisible `<div>` elements which visibility gets changed every few seconds. You don't need that list, you can also just have a plain array `['one', 'word', 'at', 'a', 'time']` and add a animation to the rotation. Of course you will need some fancy tricks for that.. or just use the plugin.  

For the future, sometimes it helps a lot just to look at the code. I pressed right mouse at the text and choose ""Inspect element"" from the context menu. In the Console (you can also open it with F12) you see that the parent element has the class `ultimate-vticker` which I Googled for and found the actual plugin behind it.  

You can also go to the scripts section (either at the top area mostly before the `</head>` tag or at the bottom before the `</body>` tag) and normaly the plugin filename isn't changed, like in the most times you immediatly see if someone is using jQuery just by loading the normal script file).

zorndyuke,"It's basically the same, just that `section` is more semantic based.  

Instead of using a `div` everywhere, using semantic based tags will help bots like search enginges or web readers to understand what you are actually representing.  

You should use `section` if you have basically a new.. well,.. a new section, a new area you want to start of. If you can add a new title, you already know that this is a new section.  

Image you have the top of your page. So this is your first section.. in this place there will go the logo, the title, probally the `nav` element etc.   

So then you have the content section.. so a new `section` again! This content section probally have something that is like an `article` where you can add a new title with some content etc., ..  

In the end: It's just semantic.  

Many elements in HTML are funtional the same, just with different styling from the browser side. Like `<strong>` is just an element with `strong { font-weight: bold; display: inline; }` while an `<p>` is just something like `p { display: block; margin: 5px 0; }`, but for the browser it's an paragraph and semanticly it should hold content in it.  

Always see HTML as a skeleton. The skeleton tells nothing! The skeleton just gives a solid base which you can use. Like it's telling you it has exact 2 arms and 2 legs, a head, a body, a ""footer"" (feet).  

The CSS is telling how it looks like. The browser automatically adds `arms, legs { position: left/right of the body; }` etc. , (except you get some disabled mutagenes). It's the developers part to add more information like hair and eye color, size, form, etc.

If you have any feedback (even negative) please let me know and I will make changes to improve this HTML notes reference book",1515525103.0

designtocode,"https://codepen.io/ufotofu/pen/GyOLPb

I plugged it into codepen, and cleaned it up a bit. Did you copy-pasta this from somewhere? theres a ton of inconsistencies, like capitalized words and values without quotations around them. 

Rule of thumb: Be consistent when writing code, its a good practice, and helps others more easily read your code, which will greatly speed up the assistance process. 

That being said, it appears to have a border when i run it through codepen, and its default displayed on a white BG. Am I misunderstanding your request?",1515347855.0

CaptainJamie,"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API  
Is what you're looking for, which I assume you've already found. There isn't a tutorial to do what you want, but I take it you want to map gamepad button presses to trigger selecting left or right, etc. I'm not 100% sure if this is possible but I can think of a way to do it. 
 
  
There is a property on the gamepad buttons object which has a property ""pressed"", listen for the desired button pressed property to check if it's true, and if so, trigger the key you'd like to use. For example, shift will move forward and shift + backspace will go backward, so map those to the left and right directional buttons on the keypad. Follow the guide above to register the gamepad, assign it to the gamepad variable and do something like below.  
  
    if (gamepad.button.pressed === true) {
        // trigger keypress on shift button here to move selection forward
    }    ",1514835711.0
flipperdeflip,"There are two parts to this: 

First is to make your site navigable from JavaScript, by creating an API or some functions to do whatever your users need to do on your site. So moving a selection thing around, moving it through the various lists, activating and canceling etc. You can test this with a simple UI with some form buttons.

Then you hook that up to the Gamepad API (and or whatever else), this is the easy part really.",1514886936.0

Matosawitko,"You need a **web hosting provider**. GoDaddy is one; there are many others as well.

A web hosting provider offers you a certain amount of storage for you to place your HTML and related files, and a certain bandwidth allotment per month.

You could self-host, if you had *all* of the following:

* A static IP address (or a service such as DynDNS that updates the DNS whenever your IP address changes)
* Your domain name registered in DNS to that IP address
* An always-on computer in the DMZ section of your router/firewall, hosting content for that IP address

/u/shoter0 mentioned Github Pages. That might work for you too, ~~though you wouldn't be able to use your domain name with it~~. There's a guide on the Github page for setting this up with a custom domain.",1513721197.0
