RandyHoward,"You don't even necessarily need anything more than HTML and CSS to pull this off, though it'd be some fairly complex CSS to do it entirely in CSS, but it looks like it'd be possible to pull off in CSS with no images or anything if you had the CSS skills.

If I were going to build this, I'd start by figuring out how to build one slice of that circle. Each segment needs to be its own element so that you can change the color of each individually. I'd probably look at using SVG elements to create them, but I believe it's possible to create them entirely in CSS, it'd require some expert-level CSS to pull off though. Once you have once slice it's just a matter of duplicating it and applying a CSS transform to rotate it into position. Functionality is fairly easy, apply a click listener to each of those segments and when it's clicked add a class to it that styles it black, and add a class to its siblings that styles it the gray color.",1543370038.0

The next part is going to be extremely costly...

In order to check the css of elements on the page there's not really a great way to do it. If you or someone else can come up with a better way, you should do it... use the universal selector (""\*"") to get all the elements on the page then check through each one to see if it's color property matches the color (as a string) of your :root variable. If the color matches, replace it with the color you want to use for IE instead.

    var colorForIE = 'rgb(241, 2, 171)';
    var colorOfRootVariable = 'rgb(0, 120, 155)';

Dr_Krampus,"You’re wanting to use jQuery’s ajax methods, but you’re gonna need some backend functionality for the target page2.

It’s like this:

Page 1 has a form

jQuery is set to fill variables of certain elements values  on page1’s form when the user submits. 

The submit button (or other action) when clicked will call some functions, one to get the variables from the form, two to parse the variables as JSON or XML, and three to POST or GET the data to the target page. 


Page2 will be primed with a function that is callable or listening on the server by using a backend technology like PHP that can receive the data from page1. Its not possible to do circumvent that, as jQuery, which is JavaScript can only be executed when a user browses the page that it’s on (unless you use Node.js, but that’s a different beast). 


I’m on mobile so this won’t be actual code but I hope it helps:


Page1:

<form>
<input id=‘name’>
<btn id=‘submit’>

<jQuery>

var name =  $(‘#name’).val();  

$(‘#submit’).click(function(){

       $.post( ""page2.php?getName="",  name); //param1 is target, param2 is what you’re sending 
}; 



Page2 //in PHP for simplicity 

If ($_REQUEST[“getName”]) {

    $name_print = $_REQUEST[“getName”];

     Echo “<h1>username: $name_print </h1>”;

anonymous_subroutine,What version of jQuery are you using?,1537477381.0
RandyHoward,"It is because you are not delegating the event. Using .click() only attaches the event handler to the items that exist in the DOM at the time the handler is created. What you need to do is bind the event handler to a parent element, so that the event is processed from a descendent element that may be added to the DOM at any time. Like so:

Instead of this line:

    $('.email_button').click(function(){

You'd do something like this:

    $('body').on('click', '.email_button', function() {

Now any descendent of the body that has the class of email button will trigger the event, whether it was there on page load or added after. It is probably not wise to use the <body> element as your parent element if you have a large complicated DOM, but it works well for smaller, less complex pages.

As a good practice, try to abandon all use of .click() and similar shortcut handlers. .click() is just short for .on('click', function(){}), and if you get into the habit of binding events with .on it'll become easier to see where you haven't delegated your event, because the element inside the .on() before the callback is missing.

Do you have to have the event listener? Would something like this not work:

    var thisHref = $(this).attr(""href"");
    if (thisHref == ""XXXXX"") { appBrowser.close(); }
    appBrowser = cordova.InAppBrowser.open(thisHref, '_blank', 'location=no, zoom=no');

tyler_the_compiler,"I'm going to be straight up, as someone with 90% of a BSc in CS under my belt, attended a very reputable bootcamp in Canada, and has been working as a programmer for ~4 years:

1. Are you focusing on preparing students for legacy work? I ask this because I'm not sure why a bootcamp would put any serious amount of focus on jQuery. Most of what it used to be good for is easily done in vanilla JS these days. It makes sense to have some cursory introduction I suppose, but if you're teaching proper common JS practices, any jQuery encountered by your students in the wild should be pretty self-explanatory; this is further the truth if you teach your students how to teach themselves in the wild, because as any dev who worked even a modicum of time programming should know that's half the battle. 

2. What is wrong with the core jQuery docs, and w3Schools? W3 Schools isn't the scourge it used to be, so for low-mid level understanding, it should be fine. As a tie-in to the tail of latter point, you should also be teaching/mentoring students how to understand, and read documentation. Know how many devs I've met who have asked me questions that are easily answered on MDN, but they refuse to use it because they don't know how to read documentation? ^1

Anyway all that said, my advice is using the actual jQuery docs, and for students who for whatever reason are struggling with that — keeping in mind it's documented well in a very clear and concise way — revert to W3Schools.

nutters,"You are comparing a single element `""Fred""` to the entire array `[""Fred"", ...]`. What you need to do is check if the array *contains* the element. You can use the `indexOf` function of arrays to check that:

    // `indexOf` returns the index in the array where the element is found, or '-1' if it is not found. 
    // So to check if the item exists, we check that `indexOf` returns any value other than '-1'

`localStorage` is a hash map of key:value pairs, so the easiest way to iterate over all values (without using a library like `lodash`)  is to use `Object.keys`, which returns an array of strings representing the keys on the hash.

    Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(function(key) {

Lucidentropy,"When you do `$('selector').click(function(){});` what you're saying is ""hey, attach this function to call on that element"". 

But the thing is, you did this on page load. After the page has loaded, javascript is thinking ""alright, I attached all the functions to the required elements, everyone's been told what to do, I'm going home"". The html you're adding is new and has not had these functions attached to them, so when you click nothing happens, these new objects haven't had any events bound to them.

To solve this, we can add an event listener: we set a permanent container to listen for _any_ events that happen within it. This will capture even newly added stuff too, because it's been told to always listen and respond, not just attach stuff at page load.

First you need a static container that javascript will find on page load, and second you need to write your click method slightly different. Lets say you added a div around your entire form called ""form-container"".

`$('selector').click(function(){` becomes `$('#form-container').on('click', 'selector', function() {`

I think the major problem was checking `$(this).attr('checked')`. When a checkbox is checked by a user, this doesn't usually add the `checked` attribute to the input. 

To check if a checkbox input is checked using jQuery you can use `$(this).is(':checked')`, or if using vanilla JS you can use `this.checked`.

I've also incorporated /u/Exolent's suggestion of not cloning, and /u/anti-anti's notes on the closing `</form>` (and a `</div>`) tag and using `<textarea>`.

In addition to this, I have also made some tweaks to the JS to simplify it a bit:

* declare and reuse variables
* chain the `.on(...)` calls

Hope that helps!

> When I try to fetch data from an XML file I fetched via $.ajax() function, I get an XML parse error in my console. Is the problem in the XML, not in my function

Hard to say without seeing the XML. The XML might be malformed (this is my guess), if the the XML is served by a host and it is returning HTML because the XML is not found jQuery might be trying to parse that instead, etc...

>  I have a JSON file ... I, however, want to access the attributes of the object

I think the data for the JSON file isn't quite appropriate for what you're trying to achieve. Was the JSON provided to you? 

Given that you've written `val[0]` above, something like this might work:

    [
    [""Afhganistan"",""+93""],
    [""Albany"",""+355""],
    [""Algir"",""+213""],
    [""Andora"",""+376""]
    ]

But I would probably change it to something more like this:

    [
    {""country"": ""Afhganistan"", ""callNumber"": ""+93""},
    {""country"": ""Albany"", ""callNumber"":""+355""},
    {""country"": ""Algir"", ""callNumber"":""+213""},
    {""country"": ""Andora"", ""callNumber"":""+376""}
    ]

And then you could refer to the properties of the objects as you iterate through.

> When I click on the image ... the image simply dissapears. I also have to make the ""x"" button to exit the enlarged image

Setting an image *object*'s `width`+`height` to 100% isn't a valid number for those properties, so the browser might be changing that to `0` (check the element inspector in your browser dev tools to confirm).

What you'll want to do instead is set the CSS width and height (try using the jQuery helper functions, search https://api.jquery.com for ""width"" and ""height"").

You could try adding a `<button>` to the page, and using an `onclick` event to remove the CSS width and height for the image.

pocketninja,"After a quick gander, I think there are two primary things going on here:

1. The order of your CSS media queries are resulting with the incorrect `display` values being applied. `min-width` means ""when device width is this size or larger"". By having the media query for 1080px, followed by the media query for 768px, followed by the query for 320px, means that 320px will always take precedence over 768px or 1080px. If you order your queries in 320, 768, 1080, you'll get a bit closer to what you want. It's not quite there though! This is because...

2. ... an inline style takes precedence over what is defined in a stylesheet. You could solve this by using JavaScript to remove the `display:none` when the window resizes, or, you could use `    display: flex !important;` in the 1080px media query



Not sure which browser you're using, but the developer tools in browsers are pretty great these days. 

For example: https://i.imgur.com/e6zLBMI.png

This screenshot shows all the styles being applied to your nav tag (after toggling mobile and resizing back to desktop). You can see the order of precedence, which is useful for determining why something might not be right. Eg, we can see that 1080px is setting `display:flex`, but then 320px is overriding that.


Anywho, I'm writing too much. Have a look at https://codepen.io/anon/pen/RMejgK to see the media queries reordered, and the use of `!important`.

I split this up into two functions: `getPeople` and `setupDT`.

`getPeople` makes AJAX requests until the `next` parameter of the JSON results is null. This grabs all of the people. It puts the results in a global variable called `people`. (Global variables are generally not a good idea, but again this is just a quick thing.)

Once that's done, `setupDT` creates the table based on the data in `people`.

Bigdrums,"You don’t need to search on every event, you only need to search on the last. I would wrap your business logic in a time-out function and clear that timeout when the event is triggered causing it to only actually fire when the user stops typing. The scope of “this” will change in the setTimeout function which brings me to my next suggestion. 
You should store your jquery objects in memory. There’s no need to keep using $(this) when you can do “var _input = $(this);” and reuse the same collection instead of generating it every time you need to reference it. 

I’m on my phone but I’ll try my best to leave a basic example of using setTimeout on keyup event. 

var forTimeout = 0;
$(“#yourInput”).on(“keyup”, function() {
    clearTimeout(forTimeout);

        //you get here after 1 second of no keyup events

pocketninja,"Sometimes it's useful to have variables which you can use to ""remember"" what the previous values were, but in a scenario as simple as this I think it's OK to just check if there is another checkbox selected. You're unchecking after the AJAX request, so there can only ever be 2 checked at a time.

With that in mind I think we can simplify the logic a bit. :)

Here's a JSFiddle where someone can check 2 checkboxes to trigger an AJAX request, and the order of selection is handled: https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/6569/

The logic essentially comes down to:

1. User clicks on checkbox
2. If no other checkbox was selected, stop here
3. Get the value of the other checkbox & this checkbox
4. make AJAX call
5. Uncheck all checkboxes

I've used an alert instead of an AJAX request for this example.

Secondly, you're referencing the exact same elements via the same query in lots of places. No performance issue, as ID selectors are very fast, but it would be more concise to assign them to reusable variables.

Thirdly, that big if-else chain is technically a switch, and would look better if it used one:

    switch (selectedValue) {

The new problem you have now is that the event handler that was connected to the old #saveButton now also is gone.  
This can be fixed by moving the click handler to the body:

    $('body').on('click', '#saveBtn', function () {
        // hander
    });

But that ends up becoming slow when you do it to too many elements, at that point you're abusing jQuery and need to move on to something more powerful like Vue.

But, an even better idea is to loop over the rows returned from your database and output the `well` value based on the index of the `for` loop. Here's as example:

     $.ajax({
            url: `http://localhost/HousingWeb-Updated/find.php`,
            type: 'GET',
            success: function(result) {

What is the rest of your markup?
",1519508831.0
winrarpants,"Your code isnt working because your variables are each line of html, however when you append html to the dom via javascript, it will do so with proper HTML markup.  For example, when you append txt1, it creates an element on the page like this:

    <div class=""col-sm-4""></div>

Then when you append txt2, inside the <body> will look like this

    <div class=""col-sm-4""></div>
    <div class=""well""></div>

When you really want it to look like this

    <div class=""col-sm-4"">
        <div class=""well""></div>
    </div>

By appending each line separately as you did, you're effectively appending a new element to the body root for all 10 lines of markup, rather than nesting it as you want to.  Your html should all be in 1 variable, and appended just like you did.

I took the time to rewrite your code from your image, however its not unlikely I missed something when transferring.  I suggest you use my example, and take the code you have to recreate it yourself.  Also, next time you post be sure to include your code in text so it can be copied and manipulated so people can help you easier.

anti-anti,"The problem is that you're attaching the event listener to any element with a class of `hiddentitle`, where this is your structure:

    <div class=""hiddentitle"">
        This is the title
        <div class=""hiddentext"">...</div>
    </div>


Because your text is inside the div with class `hiddentitle` as well, clicking that text counts as clicking on `hiddentitle`. You can stop events from child elements from 'bubbling' up to their parents by using [event.stopPropagation()](https://api.jquery.com/event.stoppropagation/) (you would add an additional click event listener to `.hiddentext` and stop event propagation there) but that's not necessary here. Instead, you could structure your HTML like this:

    <div class=""hiddentitle"">
        <h2 class=""title"">This is the title</h2>
        <div class=""hiddentext"">...</div>
    </div>

and then change your Javascript so that it reacts to clicks on the `.title` elements instead.

You'll also need to change the way your Javascript figures out which text to hide. Right now it's looking for `.hiddentext` elements inside the clicked element (`$('.hiddentext', this);`) - you'll need to tell it to [look for sibling elements](https://api.jquery.com/siblings/) instead, using `$(this).siblings('.hiddentext');`

cmndo,"You can use eval, which evaluates a string as JavaScript. The would look like

value = eval($(this).val());

But this can be dangerous because hackers can inject code into the context of your app... but if you’re not doing any database stuff, who cares. 

The other way would be to use String methods to split the string into pieces, and use those pieces as the keys for recursively traversing your object.

jesusbot,"I don't think this is a jQuery problem. It looks like you are relying on github for hosting the page, and you are making the assumption that doing a GET on /flairs is going to give you a directory listing of all the images in that folder. This might be true on localhost, but with GitHub hosting, this doesn't appear to be the case. You can see this yourself if you open up the chrome inspector, go to the network tab, and refresh the page at the GitHub URL. You can see the request to /flairs/flairs being made and it returns an empty page.",1513001869.0

Please put all those images in a subdirectory of your repo!

My guess is that those sometimes jQuery doesn't get the chance to load properly, so when you try to invoke it, it fails.

Try putting that javascript code inside a setTimeout(function(){ ... }, 0);

setTimeout will guarantee that your script will only be invoked after the page finishes loading.",1512609552.0

Vrigoth,"The following:

    $('.next').click(function() {
          $('.inner').next().slideDown('normal');
    });

Should become:

    $('.next').click(function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        $(this).parent().parent().next().find('.inner').slideDown('normal');
        $(this).parent().slideUp('normal');
    });

Here's why

Your structure is the following:

- div#accordion
  - ul.accordion
      - li
          - ul.inner
             - li.accordion
             - a.next

It's already a weird structure why do the `li` need to have a class accordion?

When you click next, you shouldn't target `.inner` since there are several of them in the page.

Instead, you traverse the dom using parent/next/previous functions.

Here when you click on `.next` I'm starting from the element you clicked on (`$(this)`) going up once to `ul.inner`.

Then once again up to `li`then I go to `next()` which is the next `li`.

Then I'm finding that element's `.inner` and I open it.

Then still with the current element you clicked (the `a.next`) (`$(this)`), I'm going up once to `ul.inner`and close it.",1512475334.0
