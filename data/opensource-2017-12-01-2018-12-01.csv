rickisen,"This subject makes me think of how the game-modding-community reacted when Bethesda announced that they were to start selling mods and give money to the creators of the mods. And how surprisingly many of the developers of the mods strongly rejected that idea as they felt it would destroy the spirit of the community. They feared that the income would never be enough to support a person anyway, even less a whole team. And they feared the squabbling over who would get the money, and calculating how much their individual efforts were worth. Also how putting a price on the hours of work and love spent on something that you planned to give out for free can end up feeling really humiliating when given a small sum of money for it. Or any sum really.  

I also think of how villages in (I think it was) Switzerland reacted when the government asked them if they could use their mountains/old mines to store radioactive waste. And how all of them rejected the idea when given a large sum of money as compensation. But some villages that never heard of the money, and who thought that they were asked to do it for free actually accepted. They felt like they were helping out the larger community, and felt pride in doing that.  

I'm not saying that Patreon, or Bitcoin ""ruined"" open source. And I don't think nobody giving back anything is a valid path forward. But I think that the idea of writing software for a community with the idea of maybe someday getting some money back for it, kinda does ruin it a bit.

Savet,"Obviously I'm not as successful or noteworthy as Linus but from my perspective both managing applications and infrastructure in an enterprise environment and also as a home Linux user is that I want a secure out of the box configuration.  I want performance benchmarks to assume good security practices so I don't see another 8+ years of fake performance numbers because CPU vendors are cheating on speculative execution to achieve performance numbers that influence purchasing decisions that leave open attack vectors.

We are in this situation because vendors made assumptions that this was not going to bite them in the ass and they should take the performance hit that accompanies that.  While AMD is also affected to a lesser degree, I don't have a lot of sympathy for Intel losing their performance advantage when they have essentially been cheating all along.

Basically OS-influence is the new shares of a company.

ivosaurus,"One reason is to get others to buy into their software (not literally buy, but take part and use it).

Android is open source, and lots of people have bought into it based on it, but Google still gets to own the authoritative fork of the project and update it.

There's also the ""Open Core"" model, where you have a basic good software package that's open source but with the ability to interface with premium plugins / functionality that costs extra.

Some game engines are doing this now, or for instance IntelliJ idea platform by Jetbrains, etc.

Similar is having an open code-base, but freely distributing a slightly modified binary that's convenient for users but helps you. Like Chrome and VS Code.

Sometimes companies are staffed by individuals that don't have the amoral impetus of the company but manage to release OSS under its banner anyway. Google has lots of side projects like this.

Sometimes they think they'll get more benefit from it being shared than keeping it secret. For example React with Facebook, if they share it with the world, then they get lots of buy in, the entire world helps them maintain and improve it. They can hire people who already know the software and don't need any training on secret sauce. They give it away but in return they eventually get value-add to help their own technical costs.

Redhat develops lots of open-source software which it kinda gives away for free, but it makes money supporting that software. Same with MariaDB people.

Sometimes you have a product where the open-source software isn't the critical value in the product, it's hardware going along with it. So you can sell and support the hardware while running OSS on it as a feature to lure more customers. Or maybe not hardware, but a connected service that the OSS interfaces with. Like selling hosted versions of servers (e.g ownCloud) that's convenient for users to pay for and get the benefits of when they don't want to self-host.",1542635129.0
ninimben,"The whole point of open source was to rebrand free software in a way that companies wouldn't find threatening or alienating. Big companies really didn't like free software because of the social/political underpinnings. This was in part the work of people like [Eric Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html). There are indeed significant benefits to companies of using open source. It saves them R&D money (for example Apple spent many years trying to write their own successor to Mac OS 9, eventually gave up and started over with a base system based on the FreeBSD userland and an open source research kernel), it saves on licensing, etc.

Open source is different than free software, however. Companies can still get away with calling things open source when they don't guarantee the freedoms required for free software. Android for example -- I have a hard time calling it really free software because in practice end users are generally not free to run anything other than their vendor-approved version of Android. This will get worse with Android's apparent successor OS, Fuchsia, which is published under a mix of BSD-style and MIT-style licenses which will allow companies to make proprietary modifications, and which appears to contain exactly zero GPL third party components.",1542647732.0

Another problem I run into is network storage. If I use SSHFS to access my notes files, will the app run well? For example, `cherrytree` cannot maintain an SQLite connection to a db store on an SSHFS mount, but `zim` works just fine because it has no database component.

Is not impossible to make money with it, it is just so hard that in most of the cases is just not worth it. With the same effort you could as well develop any commercial product that it will be 10 times more profitable!

I was proposing at the rust community a simple schema to bring good/supported libraries into the ecosystem.

Paywalled documentation and paywalled early releases. After 6 months the whole code would become completely open source but T the same time we could actually have well supported libraries with a commercial entity behind them that support it.

    ""Port Contention for Fun and Profit"" by Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, Billy Bob Brumley, Sohaib ul Hassan, Cesar Pereida García, and Nicola Tuveri: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1060

   Paper abstract: ""Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) architectures are attractive targets for side-channel enabled attackers, with their inherently broader attack surface that exposes more per physical core microarchitecture components than cross-core attacks. In this work, we explore SMT execution engine sharing as a side-channel leakage source. We target ports to stacks of execution units to create a high-resolution timing side-channel due to port contention, inherently stealthy since it does not depend on the memory subsystem like other cache or TLB based attacks. Implementing said channel on Intel Skylake and Kaby Lake architectures featuring Hyper-Threading, we mount and end-to-end attack that recovers a P-384 private key from an OpenSSL-powered TLS server using a small number of repeated TLS handshake attempts. Furthermore, we show that traces targeting shared libraries, static builds, and SGX enclaves are essentially identical, hence our channel has wide target application.""

If you decide to open source it, typical OSI licenses operate in perpetuity. Meaning the code that is open stays open forever. If anybody forks your code, stores it, whatever, you can't make them take it down later.

What you \*can\* do is close source future versions. Meaning you take the code base private, any updates operate under a closed source license.

\- What is the difference between Labels and Tags?

\- If I have Recipes and Todo Infos, can I mix them on a dashboard with other things, or are they forever isolated?

\- When I click to edit, there is a red X + checkbox that pops up at the top. That spot is very confusing, it should really be at the bottom, and more clearly attached to the edit.

\- During editing, there is a red X on the left, plus a blue X on the right. That's far too confusing, and unclear what each does.

\- It gets worse, since you can click on the title + the text to get TWO sets of red Xs, plus the blue X. This is very confusing, and looks ugly.

\- There is a very large ""expand card"" button that does very little and is (likely) infrequently used. It should be much smaller. It would be far better if that giant button had ""cancel/save"" when editing.

As for the title of the OP, yes, we've been burned *repeatedly* by Microsoft, so they need to try extra hard to win back trust.

I'm not going to switch back to Microsoft just because they release a few of their tools as open source. I *might* switch back if they significantly contribute to projects I *already* use, and if they gear their products to work better with those. For example:

- help with compatibility layers like Wine
- port large projects like MSSQL and Office to run on Linux
- implement Docker support directly in Windows I don't need a VM running
- implement support for Linux filesystems within Windows (ext4, btrfs, xfs)
- drop DirectX and push developers toward Vulkan

But no, they won't do any of that. They'll continue to push their platform and their tools instead of improving existing platforms and tools. That's just how Microsoft does business, and this whole ""open source"" push just isn't what I'm looking for.

Project | Description
:- | :-
**[Devilbox](https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox)** | Test your projects against **PHP 7.4-dev** with a configuration-free setup (dockerized LAMP stack)
**[docker-php-fpm](https://github.com/devilbox/docker-php-fpm)** | See similar images ranging from **PHP 5.2** up to **PHP 7.4-dev** with flavours for base, production ready and workhorses
**[docker-php-fpm-7.4](https://github.com/devilbox/docker-php-fpm-7.4)** | See how PHP 7.4-dev is being built


**PHP modules**

In general I try to keep all images as up-to-date as it gets and as feature-rich as it is supported.
There's however always the possibility to disable any un-required modules and be sure to only use what you actually also need.

**Syncronized directory permissions**

When using dockerized LAMP stacks for local development, you probably also came across the issue of syncing file permissions between the local system and the Docker mounted directories. This has been addressed as well by parsing the uid/gid to the container which will then internally assign the same user/group for running process as your local OS user. This has been proven to work for Linux, Mac and Windows. To read more about the concept go here: https://github.com/devilbox/docker-php-fpm#unsynchronized-permissions

Let me know of any issues, I am always happy to improve, discard outdated ideas and try new concepts.

How is this different than any other long lived TCP connection? You can ssh over tor (both in-network to onion sites and off network via exit nodes). For in-network, I think tor has its own magic. For off network... I'm not sure. I'd expect you'd continue to use the same exit node for that TCP connection but new connections would route through new exit nodes. My expectation is you'd get in situations where the websocket might be from one exit node and subsequent ajex requests are from other exit nodes. 

But they'd all have the same auth tokens and session cookies... I guess for webservers, they don't care what a user's for an IP is (at least not at the application level)... with NAT, an IP could be 30 users. With wifi and cellular, a user could be several IPs in a few minutes span. So if tor allows 1 user to simultaneoulsy be several IPs... that's just an extension of an existing problem: IPs aren't users, jwt tokens are. IPs are just where you send the response.",1541305598.0

The key to the answer is that BSD is a *copyright* license that is *permissive* (I am assuming that you do not hold a patent on the functionality you implemented).

A copyright license covers the code you studied as a concrete expression. If you copied code, it applies and you need to follow the provisions of the license. If you did not and only took inspiration from it, it does not apply. Copyright is on the specific code somebody wrote, not on the idea behind it.

The fact that MIT is a permissive license means that if it applies, you have no other obligations than naming the original author and including the original license.

Beyond what you need to do, you could consider stating what code you took inspiration from. This is however a courtesy (and a good move in general), not an obligation.

> So, once again why is IBM spending so much money on Red Hat? Because Red Hat, besides knowing Linux like the back of its hand, has an excellent Kubernetes distribution in OpenShift. And, this is important, Red Hat has numerous great open-source developers. That's vital because to make Kubernetes a much better fit with hybrid clouds, Kubernetes Federation needs to be perfected -- and it's a long way from there still. If Red Hat and IBM programmers can work in harmony on using Kubernetes to build hybrid clouds, that $34-billion may end up sounding like a steal for IBM.

I’m not sure about this theory. IBM haven’t posted net profit for like 5 years. Watson isn’t massive success. On the other hand, Red Hat had 20% growth in 2018 and 2017 and it feels like IBM is just trying to stay relevant and make some profit. That might happen, but if they pull an IBM and quadruple prices, companies might go Canonical or some new alternative will emerge (*my speculation*). I suspect that price hike might happen, since $34B for replaceable open source project hints that.

I know RHEL is not exactly easy to replace when ti comes to Enterprise, but I also know some devops folks, who were forced to switch from Debian to RHEL. The experience? *Yeah, out boss covered his ass by using Linux distro with support, but we switched from Debian that was working just fine*.

Is there a project you like or admire and (maybe) use that you want to help out with? Maybe flesh out their readme, or add double-check their step-by-step installation instructions. For example, as developers, sometimes we assume things are obvious when they aren't, and so a step could be missing during installation but we just don't know. Maybe a new step got added but wasn't added to the documentation, etc.

Maybe you tried to install the software on a different OS... add a new article about that too! NodeBB is developed, tested, and deployed on a VPS running Ubuntu, but we have installation instructions for Heroku, Cloud9, Docker, Windows, Arch, CentOS... just to name a few, because we have fans running all sorts of OSes who want to get NodeBB running on their OS of choice :)

jakemxyz,Find a project on GitHub that you use or like and look for any issues that are labeled as good first issue.,1541009978.0
jlpoole,"Here are points all apart from your ability to code something clever:

First you need to look at the license to the project.  See [It's not okay to pretend your software is open source](https://drewdevault.com/2018/10/30/Its-not-okay-to-pretend-youre-open-source.html).   How do you feel about a project that invites you to contribute, but prevents you from exercising [the four freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) of Free Software?

Then you should assess the lay of the land in terms of who the principal developers are.  How well do they respond to suggestions?  Are they receptive to contributions?  Do they fix bugs and encourage sharing?  Are their egos going to prevent your most excellent contribution from having a meaningful role?

That you want to contribute as opposed to modify to make the software accomplish something you need means you will want validation of your efforts and you want what you work on to benefit others.  There is no point to working on something just to have the developer's dismiss you and comes up with a variety of reasons why your contribution should not be included.  Thus, assessing the receptiveness of the people who control the project becomes important.  Some inventors are so possessive that they cannot conceive of anyone but themselves as to making any contribution worthy of inclusion.  These tends to be very intelligent people; but intelligence is not the full game here.

Lastly, you should look at what economic incentives the developer has... is this a project they are going to take private after harvesting contributions?  That's a tough one to predict, but if it looks like someone is hoping to make their future livelihood off of the project, then you may find you'll be shut out.

So, you may want to look at very large projects, i.e. something under Apache, where there is transparency and history and start there.  On the other side of the spectrum, you need to make a careful assessment of sole proprietorship projects that may call themselves ""open source"" when at the end of the day, you'll just butt heads with them.  Your time is precious so don't go down a road that inevitably will lead to your disappointment and discouragement through no fault of your own.",1541006413.0

\> users vote to approve pull requests

Hmm, it seems like that could easily be abused. How are you going to maintain quality (it looks like there is already a lot of junk in your database.)

\> The goal is to enable distributed decision-making so that projects can move more quickly

Hmm, citation needed? It's not clear to me that this is a problem that needed solving. Perhaps you should spend some time justifying bad outcomes you've seen from the existing setup.

\> 1.0 to 1.9 \- fixed a typo

\> 9.0 to 10.0 \- Neo from 'The Matrix'

So if I fix 10 typos, I'm the same as an expert coder who adds real value? That doesn't seem like the right ratio.

Also I'm worried about any attempts to ""game"" the system of Open Source:

\- Tracking reputation points is likely to lead to squabbles (""he got 10 points for that? I think it's only worth 7!"")

\- Getting a massive number of typo fixes accepted does not magically mean you are the right person to evaluate complex feature pull requests.

\- Having a varying scale for acceptance seems wrong - It seems like you are trying to protect against the case where there is ""nobody home"" to approve PRs. So you might be more explicit about it: ""Normally, you need x% votes from a project for approval (and 3x Yes over No.) But if there isn't critical mass, then it goes into 'default accept mode' after a few weeks or something.""

\- If you encourage people to view Pull Requests from all projects, you may find that quality will suffer because people who aren't familiar with a language will judge things from their point of view. For example, a Java programmer would accept a PR in a Ruby project that has a ""Factory"", but in fact factories are an anti-pattern in Ruby.

,"Source Code is a 2011 film staring Jake Gyllenhaal as a soldier who wakes up in someone else's body and discovers he's part of an experimental government program to find the bomber of a commuter train ... a mission he has only 8 minutes to complete.

The plot is that >!U.S. Army pilot Captain Colter Stevens wakes up on a Metra commuter train headed to Chicago. Stevens is disoriented, his last memory before that was being on a mission in Afghanistan. To the world around him – including his traveling partner Christina Warren and the bathroom mirror – Stevens appears to be Sean Fentress, a school teacher. As he comes to grips with this revelation, the train explodes, killing everyone aboard.!<

>!Stevens regains consciousness inside a dimly lit cockpit. Communicating through a video screen, Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin verifies Stevens' identity and insists he stay ""on mission"" to find the train bomber before a second bomb hits downtown Chicago in six hours. Stevens is inside the ""Source Code"", an experimental device designed by scientist Dr. Rutledge. In the machine he experiences the last eight minutes of another compatible person's life within an alternative timeline.!<

>!Stevens is unwillingly sent back into the Source Code repeatedly in frustrating, exhausting attempts to learn the bomber's identity. He tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with Christina, escaping the explosion. Other times, he cannot locate or disarm the bomb in time and dies on the train. Later, Stevens learns that he has been with them for two months since being reported killed in action in Afghanistan. In real life he is comatose and is missing most of his body, he is on life support while hooked up to neural sensors. The cockpit capsule is a projection of his brain as it attempts to make sense of a missing environment. Angry at learning that he is on life support, he asks to be disconnected after the mission and Rutledge agrees.!<

>!Stevens finally catches the bomber, a man named Derek Frost. Frost leaves his wallet behind to fake his own death and gets off at the last stop before Chicago. In their first encounter, Frost kills both Stevens and Christina and flees in a rented white van with a dirty bomb in it. Stevens remembers the license number and direction and reports it to Rutledge when he returns from the Source Code. The authorities use the information to catch Frost, preventing him from detonating the dirty bomb. Rutledge reneges on his promise to let Stevens die and orders Goodwin to wipe Stevens' memory for a future mission. Stevens convinces Goodwin to allow him one more trip back to the train so that he can try to save everyone, despite Rutledge's insistence that events could not be altered.!<

>!Stevens is sent back into the Source Code where he asks Christina to go out for coffee with him. He then leaves her and disarms the bomb, subdues Frost, and reports him to the authorities. Stevens uses Frost's phone to send an email to Goodwin before calling his estranged father and reconciling with him under the guise of a fellow soldier. Stevens returns to Christina and starts to kiss her, at the same time Goodwin approaches the Source Code chamber and disconnects the life support. Stevens dies, but in the new alternate timeline he finishes the kiss with Christina. They continue on the train and then walk through downtown Chicago to the Cloud Gate.!<

>!When the alternate-timeline Goodwin arrives for work at Nellis Air Force Base that morning, she receives the email from Stevens. The email includes a coded message verifying Steven's identity, and he informs Goodwin that they have changed history and that Source Code works.

This has come up a lot recently, with Redis and MongoDB going under what are commonly referred to as ""Source Available"" licenses. These aren't really in the definite set of ""Open Source"" -- you're not allowed to do with them what you want to. 

Take the time to study companies built around open source today. You'll find that they build their buisiness first, and as a part of their marketing explicitly call out that they're under a libre license, such as 2BSD or even GPL. What makes these companies special is that they are a central knowledge on that product and provide support contracts, typically with their libre+gratis product being supported by the community and having fewer features than the commercial one.

Having a dual-licensed bit of software is a totally OK thing, even if you aren't dual-licensing with two libre licenses, [even with the GPL as your main license](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions.html).

\- First example says ""record cpu usage of threads"" but doesn't say where it stores the data. Even looking up what `-s` does, (""save\_traceData - path""), it's not clear that it's supposed to be a directory.

\- The example ""analyze data by expressing all possible information"" should really say ""analyze previous recording.."", since it's not clear what ""data"" you are referring to. It's also confusing that the ""record"" command takes a directory, but the ""analyze"" command takes a specific file output by the record command.

This whole issue came up several years ago already, it's not a new idea. So the GPL3 got this to make it even most explicitely:

Not really necessary but better to have it clear like this to not take any chances. 

So in short, don't listen to the nonsense the anti-CoC crowed shouted around. This was already discussed more the years ago with the general consensus being that it's not possible.

Ease research.

MongoDB submitted this new license for approval by OSI at the same time that they announced that they'd relicensed all of their code.

The result, however, is that at this moment, MongoDB is under a non-approved license and therefore **IS NOT OPEN SOURCE**.

As the license review process only started this morning, there's no way to estimate how long the process will take. There also is no guarantee that the license will be found to obey the Open Source Definition, and therefore no guarantee that it will be approved.

Hopefully this will all be resolved soon, but there are far too many question marks around this license (and therefore also around any software using it) right now.

Its initially populated with a January 2017 backup of the pirate bay, and new torrents are periodically pulled from the top 20 pages of https://skytorrents.lol via a rust script. Other sites can be added as requested.

- many get tasked by their jobs to contribue (this is how a lot of Gnome and kernel dev work). Valve also specifically hires people to work on GPU drivers for AMD, that move got quite a bit of press coverage.

- some open source projects are entirely made by commercial entities who chose to make their work open source. typically, they either have a dual license (paid for commercial, but free of charge for personal use; e.g. Fedora/CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise), or only charge for support (e.g. Ubuntu (though Ubuntu has quite a lot of community contributions, but it wouldn't exist at all without Canonical)).

&#x200B;",1539253825.0
tdammers,"No. Probably not even 1% donations.

It's a complete myth that open source software gets built out of philanthropy - that practically never happens. People build open-source software, or pay others to do it for them, for the following reasons:

1. **""Scratch an itch""**: The software it is something they need, but doesn't exist yet; but because they don't intend to be in the business of making that thing, making it open source is a more sensible decision: this way, others get to benefit from it as well (but since we're not in the business of selling the thing in the first place, that's not a loss), and once they do, they will help make it better, for free (which is a win, because now we don't have to do all the work we weren't even looking to do in the first place ourselves).
2. **""Complementing commodity"":** The software to be built is a complement to the business you're in, and so a situation in which the software exists and is available at commodity price (or even for free) is going to be beneficial for your business. In a world where there are several free, high-quality web browsers to choose from, people use the internet more; if people use the internet more, then they can be served more ads; if you're in the business of selling online ads, then funding a free browser makes sense, and this is why Google puts money towards both Chrome and Firefox. And again, making the browser open-source is a strategic decision - you don't lose anything from people using it for free, because you were going to give it away anyway, and you win a lot from people tinkering with it and contributing free labor. Other example; the existence of a free, ubiquitous, and extremely robust server OS means that businesses will have more money to spend on server hardware, so if you're in that business, then funding the Linux kernel might be a smart investment.
3. **Strategy:** Most open source projects end up with a de facto authority in place that determines the direction, and if you have a lot of money to spend, you are very likely to achieve such an authority position. Google, for example, holds this position with Chrome, and as such gets a lot of say in the direction the web and its standards are headed, and they can use this leverage to their advantage. Another example is Microsoft sponsoring development of the Haskell programming language and its de facto standard compiler, GHC - Microsoft is not in the business of selling Haskell compilers, or anything Haskell, really, but they *are* in the business of selling and marketing programming platforms and tooling, and being close to the source of ongoing programming language research may given them a competitive edge.
4. **Government-funded projects:** These are usually either research grants, or funds with specific goals, such as improving the country's technological market position, achieving economical independence from large software vendors, fostering a pluralistic ecosystem in some niche, creating opportunities for participation for all sorts of minorities, etc.
5. **""It's Personal"":** some open-source projects, especially smaller ones with a relatively narrow scope, are essentially personal projects that people do out of love, as a hobby, for the learning experience, to broaden their horizon, or to beef up their resumes. People who do this will often (though not always) appreciate donations, but they're not in it for the money, and they're actually perfectly OK with the project costing them money and time.",1539257820.0

1. Start low, start by learning \`git\` and \`Github\`, and know what is difference between the two?  
2. Create a sample repository, upload file, make changes to it, commit, etc. This repository can be purely a sample or based on one of your school projects.   
3. Read the Docs,if you feel like. There is a guide provided by Github themselves [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide) 4. Look at other's repositories.   
5. If you are interested in a project, start by reading its \`readme\`, and exploring the different folders of the project. Most repositories has viable amount of information provided in \`readme\`.   
6. Look for docs, try joining a support or community forum. They might help you get hands on resources they might not have listed publicly.   
7. Tip: Look at the issues, even closed ones. Sometimes, information you need keeps lying there. Also, if you don't find something, don't be afraid to open a new issue. Someone, will respond sooner or later. If you issue is valid and someone doesn't respond on any of the open issues, I don't feel that is a project worth contributing to.

Hiring implies a contractual agreement which necessitates that there be parties to the agreement.

Projects, such as you find on Github, are not legal entities.  So whom are you ""hiring"".  I'm guessing the author is assuming the person who owns the project.  

The author goes on:

>The community then attempts to solve the software request, and the highest quality solution is decided by a vote via peer review and ultimately must be approved by the project. Once approved the smart contract releases the reward to the successful developer who solved the problem.

Who is the community?  Who are the peers?  Who is the project?  Until these parties are identified, you really are no more than handing money over to some developer and trusting that developer to abide by some process which can change in a heartbeat.

GPL does, in fact, conform to the definition; it does not restrict use, study, change, or distribution in any way - any and all restriction in any flavor of GPL merely restrict the right to *relicense*, that is, distribute exact copies, modified copies, and/or build artifacts, under a different license than the original one, or in a way that obscures the original license terms.

What you are after isn't open source, but maybe something like ""shared source"" (where you grant the right to inspect the code, but restrict the right to use, modify, and distribute) - but it's a bit of an iffy situation, because these four things really go hand in hand, e.g., if you propose a change via a github PR, you are already doing all four things: you make a copy to work on, you use it in order to test your changes, you make changes, and you redistribute both the original and the modified version as part of the PR process.

So really what you'd need to make the thing you want happen is a full-on proprietary  license between you and individual students, which clearly outlines what they can and cannot do. You will also need to get a paid subscription if you want to implement a PR process on github under these conditions.

This is a post about someone selling proprietary software which happens to be based on a similar, but less featured open source project. Also their tone about forks is quite disturbing. If someone forks my free software project and imporves it that's lovely news as there now exists a better version of the software I needed. I can then go and freely implement any of their additions I like back into my software. This is how open source development is meant to work and the author of this blog seems to completely misunderstand that and instead sees it as some cute marketing bullet point you slap on.

When you use bash or gcc on your computer. There is no ""Enterprise"" or ""Professional"" edition. There never will be because the GPL protects free software and keeps it free.

That said if the GNU project wanted to charge for purchasing copies of gcc or bash they most certainly could. They could even sell a gcc or bash enterprise support subscription which includes developers and support specialists being on call to fix urgent problems your business encounters. (The GNU project currently does not do that and instead relies on donations, but it certainly could sell support or binaries in the future.)

That is VERY different from selling a closed source version of the same software with some extra features.

galgalesh,"> The number of macros in the code is so great that it seems that the code is written not in the C programming language, but in its peculiar dialect.

Perl 5 was specifically engineered so that developers could create a new dialect as part of their application. It's like operator overloading on psychedelic steroids.

This explains a bit why the codebase of Perl 5 itself also looks like it's written in a dialect of c, the developers tasted the strength of this in Perl 5 and also want to use it in C.

The huge disadvantage, and the reason why Perl 5 will never take off imo, is that it creates code that is incredibly difficult to understand for people not intimately familiar with the codebase. Developers wanting to change something in such a codebase have to learn both Perl 5, and the dialect that was created for that program.

I don't think that there is a full answer that is right for everyone; what might be a trivial contribution for one person might be a significant first step for another person, so I think it's something that each person has to evaluate themselves.  One way to do that is by looking at the Values listed at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details.

The second value mentions ""personal growth, professional opportunities, and community bonding"".  It may be hard to tell whether your contributions may lead to professional opportunities, but you can ask yourself whether you feel that working on your contributions help with your own personal growth, or help you understand and be more of a part of the free software/open source community?  (e.g. If putting your name in a contribution.md file helped you learn how to use GitHub, then you might consider that personal growth, or maybe not.)

The third value talks about impact, so you can ask yourself whether your contributions help the impact of free/open source software.  Is it building something useful? Is it something that will help other people?

Not all of your PRs need to touch all the values, but I think that the values can be used to help evaluate your overall experience this month.

ahfoo,"Best of luck to this project but as a person who has both been involved in textbook and on-line instructional material development as well as being a classroom teacher I believe the metaphor I would use is ""spitting in the wind"" because from what I learned the hard way over and over is that the last place we can expect to see serious adoption of open source will be in the schools. This is quite the opposite of what a naive view would expect and it took me a long long time to see why but eventually I realized this is a fundamental fact. 

I won't even go into the textbook side of things. I'll just say that textbook publishing is a cartel, a syndicate, an group of well financed bullies. . . an oligopoly. That's what I learned from spending years writing textbooks and on-line instructional materials: it is a big money game pure and simple. This extends all the way to the deeply corrupt semi-private Educational Testing Service (ETS) which is an utter disgrace and perfect example of a failed effort to bridge the private and public sectors with an ugly opaque bureaucracy that masks yet another group of money grubbing parasites leeching off the failed school system. 

No, I'd like to talk about classroom teachers rather than textbook publishers. I was called into the administration at my college a few years back because I had been reported to them for using open source in the classroom. I thought I was in trouble with the administration but they were actually very pleased to hear that I was using open source in the classroom. The dean explained to me that it wasn't the administration who was insisting on using proprietary software in the classroom but rather my fellow faculty. You see, the other teachers believed that if they were not teaching proprietary software packages like Microsoft Office or Autodesk's 3D Studio Max or any of the other long list of commercial packages that have become defined as ""professional"" products then they would lose their jobs. 

The real problem with for-profit proprietary software in the schools is that it creates a world in which the schools are training centers for corporate products and the students are potential customers for those corporate entities who then actively colonize the schools by focusing on the individual teachers themselves. This is a vision of the schools as job training facilities in a corporate meritocracy. The problem is that this is a fantasy vision. There is no meritocracy in a corporate dominated society, there are haves and have-nots and the have-nots can go die as far as the corporations are concerned. That might be a hell of a way to drive efficiency for corporate profits but it sure the fuck ain't much of a way to create a strong, stable, creative, sharing and caring society. 

The schools are absolutely the last place open source will ever gain a foothold as long as we accept that corporate greed should be the guiding principle of the economy. As that seems to the state of affairs, the outlook for open source in the schools is dim at best.   ",1538531115.0

I wrote that code because it solves problems I had, and releasing it for others requires close to no effort at all. Any and all contributions are of course welcome, but if you only ever take and never give back, I won't see the difference anyway, and so I really don't care the least.

In fact, if someone were to offer me money for that code, I might reject - I have a stable income, I don't need the money, but most of all, I don't need any additional pressure, obligations, etc. The code is provided as-is, and I'll do whatever I feel I can do to help you use it, but I'm not doing this for profit, and I'm definitely not looking for people being somehow entitled to anything.

Incidentally, I also work on open-source projects on the job; and here, the entitlement that comes with money is real. I don't always get to work on what I think is fun, or what I think would be the most pressing thing, but rather on what stakeholders pay for.

Either way, the key observation here is that as long as you don't interact with the authors / maintainers, you aren't contributing anything, but you're not taking anything away either. If you download and install my software and never tell me about it, I won't notice, it doesn't cost me a thing, I'm not losing anything, and I'm not doing any additional work; if you download and install it, and then ask me a hundred questions, then you're costing me time and effort. If you find and fix a bug, then, you're still costing me some time and effort (I have to communicate with you, review your patch, merge it, bake a new release), but the bug may also be relevant to me, or it may at some point help someone else who will then proceed to improve things in ways that are relevant to me, so there is also some benefit. It's not automatically a given that any kind of participation is going to be a net positive, although I'm a bit of an optimist that way and generally assume that more people providing feedback is a good thing and will, overall, make things better for everyone involved including myself. But again, no interaction at all is a perfectly fine neutral default, and I'd much rather you just quietly and invisibly use my stuff (or not) than ask a million questions that are already answered in the README, or make all sorts of ridiculous feature requests that would make things too complicated and not a lot more useful.",1538399042.0

I have a recurring donation from my personal account to the OpenBSD foundation for 50eur/mo. I used to pay in to the FSFE, I still pay into the linux foundation (which gives nice benefits).

Regarding contributions: if I manage to fix something I always make a PR/Merge request. It's part of many licenses that you should... but it's also good hygiene. If you maintain a branch of software it's going to be harder to keep backporting updates over time, if you merge it upstream then there's no issue with taking the latest version.


For your main point: I'm not sure if it's enough, it's likely not.

**dav1d** is a new **AV1** cross-platform **D**ecoder, open-source, and focused on speed and correctness.

The canonical repository URL for this repo is [https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d)

# Goal and Features

The goal of this project is to provide a decoder for **most platforms**, and achieve the **highest speed** possible to overcome the lack of AV1 hardware decoder.

It aims to support all features from AV1, including all subsampling and bit-depth parameters.

In the future, this project will host simple tools or simple wrappings (like, for example, an MFT transform).

""Why Microsoft Makes $5 to $15 From Every Android Device Sold""

https://www.howtogeek.com/183766/why-microsoft-makes-5-to-15-from-every-android-device-sold/

To this day Google has NOT charged a single cent in royalties.  Not a single cent.  Never used their IP as a weapon but instead give it away.  How we got so many things like Map/Reduce, TF, HTTP2, K8S, etc.   Right now Google is developing Fuchsia in the open and I can watch each line of code change.   

If MSFT followed Google lead then I would change my opinion of them.  That MUST change!

Google owns the two most popular clients in the world and own the two most popular web sites.   They created SPDY in secret and collected the data on performance improvements.

Then gave it all to IETF and how we got HTTP2 in record time.  MS would NEVER do anything like that when they had power.

That is what you look at.  How do companies conduct themselves when they have the power?

The one that is really aggravating is security with MSFT.  Google has found Shellshock, Meltdown, Cloudbleed, Heartbleed, Spectre among a bunch of others.  Why is MSFT not finding?     Instead Google finds their flaws, reports it to MSFT,  MSFT bitches instead of thanking Google.

Look at the MPEG-LA extorting money out of everyone.   It was obscene.  They tried to use patents as a weapon.  Google developed VP8 and VP9 giving away for free and then on top telling anyone that uses they will give them patent infringement.  This ended the MPEG-LA extortion.  That is what MSFT should be doing.

GPL has section on exceptions, you could could distribute it like this:

> As a special exception, the copyright holders of this program grant a non-exclusive transferable exception to [company], allowing them to distribute derivative works under any terms they wish, regardless of the requirements of the license.

praetor-,"If you distribute your code under the GPL there's nothing stopping anyone from using it without paying you; part of the GPL is that you can't restrict this.  Under the terms of the GPL someone could also fork your software and provide binaries for free as long as they also made the source available.  Under the GPL you are required to provide the source to anyone that requests it.

The GPL _does_ require that if anyone modifies your source code to meet their needs, and wishes to sell it or use it in a commercial product, that they must also release that code under the same GPL.  This is effective at preventing commercial interests from profiting from your work.  You may also consider adopting the Affero GPL or AGPL which extends the copyleft aspect of the GPL to other pieces of software that connect to yours over a network; this makes it very difficult to use the software for profit, other than for internal operations.

You might consider adopting a dual licensing scheme where the code is provided as open source under the GPL, but anyone wishing to use it without also distributing the GPL would need to purchase a license to do so.

Long story short, if you want to charge for the right to use the software then you shouldn't license it under the GPL; your software is not free (as in speech or beer).",1537635400.0
bradfordmaster,"You should talk to a lawyer (I'm not one) if you're really concerned, but a few things:

By default you own the copywrite on any code you solely produced on your own. You can license that code by giving it to people and stipulating terms they must abide by to use the code. You can usually distribute your own code under multiple licenses if you want, as long as it's fully your own and not derived from code with a license that blocks that.

If you use some third party gpl code, that means that you are bound by the gpl for that ""part"" of the code. This can be tricky to interpret, but probably means your whole app, or at least any libraries that the the code. What you are bound to do, in general, is make the code (and license) available to anyone you distribute the software to. Technically this means that you could only give it to people who pay for your app, but you _can't_ limit thier ability to modify or redistribute it, so as soon as you have a single paying customer, your code is theoretically free in the wild. Therefore, it doesn't make much of a difference if it's the code for the demo or the full app.

To answer your original question, though, if you are bound by a license on code you don't own, then it doesn't matter whether it's a ""demo"" or the full product, as long as the demo contains the gpl code (or any code derived from it), you must make it available.

- The next day, the change [was reverted](https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/android_packages_apps_Jelly/commit/4c6aab871213b37b1baf6e88640155784ddb2569) by the same person who made it, so they realized the mistake.
- Afterwards, the similarly-named commit [e56dfae8](https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/android_packages_apps_Jelly/commit/e56dfae8bafd30f5ff0be8965cfdae1d3281ce6a), ""Add authors and update copyright"", added a copyright notice to the files _in addition_ to the LineageOS copyright line, so it reads:

        Copyright (C) 2017 The LineageOS Project
        Copyright (C) 2018 e Foundation

    This is standard practice when a project is forked; you keep the original copyright line, and add your own.

danhakimi,"Here's a different perspective on why this won't work.

Encryption ideally makes it so that only the parties to an interaction can see the contents of that interaction. If you include a backdoor, you'll either need plaintext -- ie totally unencrypted storage, so you won't have encryption -- or need a third key that you give to the government. You're trying to make the government a party, but make nobody else a party.

Now, say you find a secure way to give the government one key, which it keeps on one server, which is not connected to the internet, or any intranet, and only a few government officials have access to that server room, and they need a warrant from a judge to bring a message to that server for encryption, and, somehow, the key cannot be removed from the server. Any less than that, and, again, any schmuck working for the government or with access to the network the server is on or with access to the room would be able to get access to the key, granting access to somebody 

But... Wait, you need that key to sign every single message you send every which way. People have figured out three-way encryption, but it's slower, so that won't work for, say, fast video streams -- it would pose a noticeable limit on the quality of encrypted calls. Let's say we're willing to deal with that.

In order to encrypt each message, you need the government key on hand -- at least when a conversation is made, I believe. Again, we were trying to separate the government key from every network, but... Your messaging happens over the internet, so you need an internet-connected device to know the secret key that can be used to read everybody's messages. Most people at the company will probably be able to get their hands on this key, as will anybody who can hack into their network. Now Facebook is a party to all of my conversations, too. And they won't need warrants. You can make it illegal, but they're *definitely* going to read my shit.

So there is no ""backdoor to encryption,"" there's just ""not encryption.""",1537485851.0

vampatori,"I don't think I see what a regular business owner would hope to gain out of this.  From a business perspective, support contracts/SLA's (either first-party or third-party) seem like a much more solid way of doing things.. there's a tangible ""I pay X and get Y"".  If you're not interested in that, most projects have the ability to donate to them.

We once based a product on an open-source CRM system, but a big part of choosing that as a base was whether we could get a support contract with the core developers.  Without that possibility, we just wouldn't have picked it as it was too big and complex, and too important to the product.. it would have been better rolling our own or going with a fully commercial offer.

We once used an open source image processing library and there was an issue we just didn't have the knowledge in-house to fix it and push it back, or the time to learn it.  So we got in-touch with the developer, paid him for a days work, the issue was fixed, everything was good.

With ""less visible"" packages, I understand that's more difficult - but that's where your organisations like Red Hat, Zend, etc. come in.  We pay them, and they pay (or hire) the people that need to be paid to keep their offer solid.

Clearly I'm missing something or don't properly understand it.  I think their idea is based around dripping money to developers to help encourage them to stay developing their projects?  A little icing on the cake?  But at the same time, it doesn't seem like enough money to really be make or break (compared to how much someone that developed such a useful project could just make with their time).  The business funding this doesn't get any kind of additional ability to get support/specific issues/etc. dealt with either, which I can get elsewhere - often at third-party organisations that include core developers of the project(s).

I'll start off with, everyone is entitled to their opinion. 
Also, everyone is at a unique level of understanding of implicit or explicit manifestations of bias, racism, sexism, and many other discriminatory states of thought and action based on their own experience with them and reading of them. 

Now with those disclaimers, a lot of folks in here need to read a lot more about these sorts of issues before speaking on them as subject matter experts. I mean, a lot of reading. Because clearly there's a lack of personal experience in your own lives or with people close to you. 

The most common ""I'm ignorant but I think I know what I'm talking about"" flag are those of you in here who have made logical equivalencies that you think are accurate because you've rooted your argument in a vacuum that does not encompass the totality of circumstances or doesnt separate the theoretical from the practical. The only example I'll give of this, and there are a lot to choose from, is the notion that capitalism and racism/sexism are not inextricably linked. In theory, that's true depending on your philosophical opinion of the definition of capitalism. 

In practice, however, there is not a large-scale manifestation of capitalism on this planet (ie, a nation's general economic policy) that is free from having roots and lifeblood provided by racism and sexism. Not one. That's practically speaking, the history of the world as experienced. Not the history of thought or what could be. Or should be. Considering most people in here understand how intertwined our global economic system is, at least technologically, it really shouldn't be that difficult to understand how bias policies, actions, and ""legacy code"" still affect modern day biases, policies, and ""code"".

Promulgate- there is no controlling body to make such a statement.  Any project is free to adopt such statements as they please.  If they accept such a statement, any other group may fork their project at the most recently unencumbered version and continue on.  


Conflict of Interest- you seem to completely misunderstand this legal term.  There is a very good definition arising from decades case law.  Making a business choice to work on a paod feature over a free feature will never be a conflict.  In many cases, simply disclosing the potential conflict is enough to avoid the issue.  See scholarly journals with a footnote saying the research was funded by an entity that wants the results.  The project licese file likely has a statement saying there is a free verson and a paid version.  Features may be wildly different.  They correctly disclosed, there is no issue here.  



Actions like this, which seek to control a community from the outside may result in the opposite of your vision.

Swelfie,"When I am hiring, I look at your open source work similarly to you previous employment. Perhaps a bit more so because it actually allows me to view the quality of your code. So if you are low on experience but have prolific contributions it can help quite a bit.

Being active in a project my team utilizes is another big boon because I know that I am not only getting someone who knows the project and api, but also getting a great communication channel into the project for pushing features and bug fixes back in efficiently and having more influence in design and project direction.

If you are very influential in popular projects it can be huge because many projects become sponsored by companies and they will hire you to work full time on the project because it is critical to their own products.

And finally expertise. There is a world of difference between someone who knows posgresql and someone who actually develops for thenpostgresql project. As an employer I know I'm getting someone with deep and specialized knowledge if you are a dev on the project.

Then there is making a name for yourself. If you are highly influential on big projects and are well known in OSS then a lot of doors open to you.

If this is the aim then the first major failure was in choosing that name. A name should be easily pronounceable at a glance. If I tell someone the name of your project they should be able to do a web search without me telling then how it's spelled with special characters. I tell this to every FOSS maintainer with a docs page about how to pronounce a project name. If a visit to the docs is required just to share the name of the project with someone then you've already screwed up the adoption of your software. With that name the only people who will ever care at all about /e/ are niche tech geeks.

lemford,"If all you need at the beginning is some static ""about"" pages, I would highly recommend using an out-of-the-box service like squarespace/wix/wordpress/etc. They're all cheap (like $10 a month I want to say) and will be plenty for what you need. They can also deal with the payment/donation feature you want in phase 2. 

Why do I recommend you do that? Well, you have two other main options: 1) learn web development and build the site yourself, or 2) hire a web developer to build the site for you. If you go with (1), you'll end up spending months learning and the final product won't look as good as a canned site and will be a mess under the hood. You'd save money all around but won't be happy with the timeline or results. And I'm guessing (2) isn't really an option for you given your budgetary concerns. A static site alone would probably cost hundreds of dollars plus hosting from a decent dev, let alone the more advanced features. And hiring a dev for a static site is overkill anyway. I'm a web developer myself and anytime friends or family ask me if I can build them a sure like you're describing I give them the same advice I'm giving you. 

Finally, you've hinted at it already so my guess it you may want to go with the elusive option (3): see if a web developer will build this for you for free. If you can pull this off, great, but I'll warn you that you may not have a ton of luck. Web devs are busy (who isn't?), so you may not get any bites. If you really want to go with this option I would target asking college students, partnering with someone in a boot camp or anyone else who is still in the learning phase. That said, you'll have to be happy with what you get and it might not not be the same quality you'd get from an experienced dev or from one of the canned services I mentioned. Finally, once you get that site built, the developer will likely not want to stay on forever for free to help you maintain it so now you're stuck with a site you don't know how to maintain and have to go back to options (1) or (2) after all. So again, I really recommend a canned service for your use case. Once you have success and some capital and need that more complex site you can hire a dev to build and maintain it for you. 

Also, to get back to the open source angle on your question, a lot of people think of open source as being a free version of something you would otherwise pay for. That's sometimes true, but more often open source means free tools for you to use along with some know-how to build what you want. Luckily, almost all web development libraries and tools are free and open source, but you have to have the programming knowledge to use those tools to build yourself a site.

You also asked for other subs to post this on. r/webdev is a web development sub, but I'm guessing that you'll get a similar answer to what I gave or some light (or heavy) mocking for just asking for free labor. There are also plenty of other sites out there for finding devs for hire if you choose to go that route. 

I hope this didn't come off as harsh in any way but I see a lot of people make the same mistake of wanting an expensive and tough service that they really don't need and hurting for it financially or in time spent. ",1535628352.0
HittingSmoke,"I hate to be that guy, but the place to cut your teeth on managing your own website with open source software is not on a production website with private user information and payment collection. You're a very long way off of being qualified for that and even attempting it with your skills is downright irresponsible.

Do not follow the advice in this thread and self host WordPress. Managing WordPress requires server and web app hardening skills as it's the most targeted website by bots and hackers on the planet.

What you need at this point, if you're not in a place to hire a developer and keep someone on staff to manage the website, is a collection of managed services. There are a ton of managed WordPress providers out there. Squarespace isn't bad if you don't know what you're doing and want to customize a website.

Then you're going to want to find other external services that provides your required functionality. Square is the most popular payment processor out right now and they support non profits.

Not popular? Literally every company does this.  Can you imagine Google or Amazon if their 10+ million boxes of infrastructure had to pay Microsoft for every server?

In fact, I dare you to find *one* company that doesn't use any open source software. You won't find one -- just a company that doesn't know what open source software is built in to it's proprietary software. (For example, the Windows TCP/IP stack used to be copied from BSD.)",1535259389.0

These opportunities do not come every day, and they require sometimes multiple congruent skill sets to properly implement.

Sacrosaint,"I've asked a lot of people about this.

There are loads of reasons from stigma against free work, to shyness, to tooling, etc., etc.

The biggest reason, though, is that once a graphic designer figures out the tooling, finds a thing to work on, and does the work, they are met with two things that are extremely off-putting:

- **Developer bluntness.** On GitHub and elsewhere, developers are often very blunt when they point out something is wrong. This is seen as an asset in FOSS but it's very foreign to someone who is dipping their toes in.
- **Unwanted feedback.** Because design is visible, *everyone* has an opinion. You think you get a lot of comments on your PR? If you allow design by committee, you'll never get anywhere. Generally designers need creative freedom and authority to make decisions a little more than developers do. By letting the greater community critique the design, the designer probably feels discouraged and won't find the work fun or rewarding.

It's a complicated issue, but in short, designers don't often do FOSS because: they have to deal with hard tooling, they get overly critiqued on every little thing, and the community doesn't communicate with designers the way a normal client would.",1535149218.0

In open source it's also most likely a developer calling the shots, where in a commercial environment it's usually not a developer making the business decisions, and there is often other drivers, i.e. if something looks great, it'll be easier to sell (this in it's own can become a problem if it goes too much the other way!).

Lastly, lack of collaboration, how features work vs. how they look, and how the user expereince works is often not pre-planned or strategically discussed, the developer codes what they want, and it's left up to the designer to force-fit a design around poor UI decisions.",1535158771.0

raghukamath,"Sharing my personal experience here. I am a pro open-source guy, I even use all floss tools to design and illustrate, even my OS.

Like it is said already in the top comment, programmers give very bitter and vague feedback, often not worth anything to the design. It happens since design is subjective some blue may not be liked by a person who likes red. Then there is collective opinion sharing, which amounts to countless redos. Think about rewriting your program countless times just because someone comments.  

For example a designer proposes a logo to a project, then people google some logos and suggest that we should make it like that, someone else proposes something else, every tom dick and harry wears the designers hat.  If there are so many designer why do we professional waste our time. All this chaos is meaningless. The maintainers prefer democratically found solution so it is often hard to make a point in the chaos, at the end what is left is not what designer wanted.

For better design contributions programmers should stop being designers and let the design decisions to actual experts, nowadays everybody thinks he is a designer.

Even if the designers respect foss and come to contribute they are not welcome or treated correctly, may be because of the culture difference of the field.

I am not saying one shouldn't critique and just accept what designers contribute, i am saying programmers and OSS community by large should learn how to give constructive feedback on designs

However shopping via Internet they might, so that is why this is also changing gradually via court cases.

> Randomness is hard to come by. Especially on deterministic machines like computers.

That's not true. Every modern operating system for the past 20 years has been extracting entropy from hardware timing events, CPU jitter, interrupts, and some other sources of randomness. These sources are fed into a randomness extractor, which then acts like a seed for the operating system's CSPRNG (/dev/urandom in Linux and other unix-like OSes).

> Generally we settle for pseudorandomness, which closely resembles randomness, but actually isn't.

The nice thing about the kernelspace CSPRNG is that it produces a near infinite amount of cryptographically secure pseudorandomness that in indistinguishable from naturally occurring ""true random"" white noise. Unless you need better performance without being cryptographically secure, you should use your OS CSPRNG.

> The main sources of pseudorandomness in a computer are memory and CPU. There are other methods of generating random numbers with a computer using human input, such as keystrokes, mouseclicks and mouse movements. But those methods require constant new input from a human user.

It is true that solid state headless systems will have less entropy to extract than systems with users at the terminal. However, all is not lost. CPU jitter exists in all CPUs, from small embedded systems to heavy clustered servers. [This abstract from Stephan Müller](http://www.chronox.de/jent/doc/CPU-Jitter-NPTRNG.html) outlines how it can be extracted and fed into the operating system kernel as a source of randomness.

Licenses are verbose, right? They contain sentences long enough that one forgets the start by the time one reaches the end. This is because licenses are legal documents, and the purpose of a legal document is to *clarify* an agreement. *Ambiguity* is the absolute enemy of this.

Words and phrases like ""ethical"", ""politically-correct"", and ""discrimination"" are ambiguous – to the extreme in today's social environment. They have absolutely no place in a legal document, *unless* that legal document also exhaustively defines what it refers to when using these ambiguous terms. Even terms like ""You"", ""Work"", and ""Contributor"" are ambiguous enough that licences often include explicit definitions of them, e.g., the [Apache License, version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

Additionally, I would argue that ""open source"" is fundamentally about technology. It's about releasing source code, generally under permissive terms, for purely technical reasons. If you want to get political on top of that, you have free software and copyleft licenses.

I find the MS Office user interface so much more intuitive and organised. The LibreOffice user interface has always been what bothers me the most about the software. It is clunky, cartoonish and I do not enjoy reading long lists of menu items.",1534477460.0
sybesis,"The problem with UI design is that there is no choice between 2 paradigm. I'm not fan of both paradigm. Both have advantages and short comings.

I think the problem is how people are used to use softwares. Say you want to edit text. We're used to WYSIWYG editors. The idea is pretty cool but If I was to write a book or a document. I guess it would be more productive to write the content of the document first then make it look nice. 

With WYSIWYG editor you're pretty much editing everything at the same time. Which makes you break your documents visuals here and there as changes affect the rest of the document. 

So it would make more sense to redact a document as text/data first then have different ""type"" of ui for each step until you release it. 

You start from raw data to a more elegant view of the document. Each step would have its set of ui and could help keep the ui uncluttered. Say in the redacting mode you don't have access to editing function of the document.

A good set of default could help people edit documents without having to mess with borders/tables etc. 

Editing visual element could be done directly on the document as you select a table header showing different options exactly where your cursor is. (I guess microsoft office already has a bit of this).

experts_never_lie,"The biggest thing you need here is the nutrition data.  It's too expensive to go out and get directly (unless regulations require a central clearinghouse for it), so even the proprietary services rely on users entering it themselves to build out its coverage.

People have a higher cost (entering more food types themselves) if fewer people have already used the system, so the databases with more users have more benefit for each user.  This is a network effect, and typically leads to persistent winners.  That can make it hard for a new database to get started.

But … back to regulations: the [USDA has a searchable database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list)!  I just checked it with a food UPC and got a match on the nutrition label.  I don't know if food providers are required to publish it, but that would fit.   And they let you download the whole database.

If anyone picks a good open-source system, and if the terms of use allow it, we clearly need to augment its database with this federal one, if they haven't already.

If someone finds a good open-source tracker that is good in other ways but lacks good product data, PM me and I can see if it has a bulk ingest operation (something that, in a different interpretation, calorie-trackers try to prevent…) to allow wholesale addition of the federal data.

I do not have a particular project or project lead to recommend. But I do want to comment to suggest that you NOT be pointed in a different direction. I think your analysis is accurate and that there are many projects which would benefit significantly from the skills you are offering (even if they don't realize it now).

That being said, I do have one suggestion about direction. If you were interested in doing small amounts of work for lots of little projects (the kind of logo creation you mentioned) then it would just be a matter of finding projects, any project. but you are interested in making a deeper, more long-term contribution to a particular project. I think that the need for illustration skills will scale with the number of users (especially new and inexperienced users). Therefore, I think you would be most useful to a large project with a significant number of new users.

My suggestion would be to find a project that fits this mold -- something like the Python language, or Libre Office, or Gimp -- then start by drawing five or six illustrations for their existing new user handbook. If you reach out to a project leader and already have a small portfolio to demonstrate what you could offer to the project, I think they would be much more likely to take you seriously.

forteller,"First off: Thank you so much for this! You are completely right that too many FOSS projects overlook the importance of visual beauty. I think that's a big part of why so many are not more popular among ""normal people"".

I have two general and one specific thought about what I'd love you to work on:

Specific: [Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/home/) is a protocol that wants to take over for Slack (and IRC) as a chat system for teams. It's are FOSS and decentralized, and might be quite important in the future. Its main client is a web based client called [Riot](https://about.riot.im/). My workplace needs a collaboration tool soon, and I really, really want to recommend Matrix over Slack. But I have a few issues with it. One of them is that Riot is quite ugly. If you could fix that, you might help FOSS win over the proprietary, walled chat gardens.

Also, the website of [Riot](https://about.riot.im/) is not very nice.

Speaking of websites. My first general idea is this: I think a ton of great FOSS apps are not even given half a chance by a lot of people because they have a ugly website. Even the tiniest little app for macOS has an awesome website, while big FOSS projects have some terrible boxes with terrible colors and no screenshots. I don't know if you can design websites, but there's a lot to do here. LibreOffice might be too big to let someone just come in and take over their website, although Ceiling Cat knows they need it. But maybe [Pitivi](http://www.pitivi.org/) or something?

My second general idea is to go to https://prism-break.org/en/ and find some project you like that is in need of help.

feross,"Site author here! So, the context for this site is that I was reminiscing about the days of Geocities and Angelfire, back when the web was quirky and fun. I remembered how sites used to use the <bgsound> tag to include an autoplaying background MIDI file. Those files had such a nice, old-school aesthetic.

I wanted to hear some MIDIs, so I searched and found a .zip file with 100K+ MIDI files that someone posted to Reddit. I tried playing a few in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc. and then realized that they've all dropped the <bgsound> tag. Even Quicktime and VLC couldn't play back the files.\*

There were some websites that could convert MIDI to low-quality MP3, and technically Apple still offers Quicktime 7 for download which can play MIDI, but it wasn't easy or fun to do.

Some websites offered inline playback with Flash (but it was flaky and hard to get working in Chrome), and the JS-based ones were missing many instruments or multi-MB Emscripten-compiled monstrosities!

I decided that I'd compile the best MIDI player written in C (libtimidity) to WebAssembly and put in lots of effort to optimize the bundle and include the minimal amount of code. The result of that is here: [https://github.com/feross/timidity](https://github.com/feross/timidity) It's quite lightweight - just 34 KB of JavaScript and 23 KB of lazy-loaded WebAssembly.

Then I put a frontend on it, so it's easy to browse that .zip file's contents. And that's BitMidi.

I plan to ingest a lot more MIDI files in the future, perhaps from the Geocities MIDI archive on the Internet Archive.

Feedback welcome!

\* I later learned that VLC can actually play most MIDIs and I just got unlucky with the few I tried! That's okay though – I got to learn a lot about MIDI files, Emscripten, WebAssembly, and modern front-end web techniques. And I made a cool site too :)",1533842062.0

Wolvereness,"You're using some ambiguous wording for what you're actually doing, and all of this ignores AGPL.

Are you *distributing* something *derived* from a GPLed product? Servers use Linux (GPL) to run websites literally everywhere, many with custom modifications, but they are under no obligation to license their Linux modifications unless they're distributing them.

The only thing that matters for websites are the things that get sent to the browser. If you wrote all the JavaScript libraries getting sent to the browser, and use your own assets, it doesn't matter that you're using Linux/some-other-GPL-runtime.

If you distribute an app that includes the GPL framework, then you must include notices and source for everything GPL. Additionally, the things you wrote may require licensing depending on what's commonly referred to as ""arms-length"". It's unusual to consider a packager to require the package to be licensed; so if you only use someone else's GPL runtime to perform its normal duties, and your code is ambivalent of the GPLed code, then you probably don't need to license your code.",1533751200.0

I'd create a second firefox profile with  `firefox -P`  or go to `about:profiles`, and set up your apps in multi-account containers. Tell it to remember your session when you restart. You could also throw in the temporary containers addon so that when u click a link (eg in facebook) it opens in a temporary container instead of the default one.

If you use google chrome you could just use profiles to isolate apps with a command like this:

`chrome --user-data-dir=/home/<user>/.chrome-facebook-profile`

giving each app a different folder. Could also use `--app=` to launch the site in its own app-like window.  I have messenger set up in a .desktop for chromium file like this:

`Exec=chromium-browser --app=https://messenger.com --user-data-dir=/home/<user>/.chromium-facebook-profile`

If I was Linus i'd revoke Google's git access to the Kernel and tell them to pound sand on their custom Android/ChromeOS forks/Fuschia's NewOS Kernel. I personally cannot wait to see the steps on how to exclude this from Ubuntu Server. 

Edit: And as far as I am concerned, Android and Fuschia are indefinitely off my future procurement lists. My Pixel XL will be my last Android phone, and I will begin addressing moving off Google for my other shit. Yep, this was the red line and they just pissed on it.",1533583075.0

This part is great too:

> - Q: You claim that third party analysis is indicative of the algorithm's real security. Were you aware of all these results when you published the algorithms, or are any of them better than what you knew of?

This means Google is caving to the NSA request for easily breakable encryption, something Apple would not do.  (No I don't believe the story that it is for low powered computing devices.)  It further must mean that Google is going to be compensated by the US government in some way, such as maybe an injection of money or an intercession in the EU anti-trust cases.  Something anyway.

The distro makers should be removing that code from the kernel as a matter of course.  If the NSA provided it it is not good.  As the article says it is weak encryption making it poor.  As the history of the NSA has shown their actions are not altruistic.

https://tldrlegal.com/",1533414401.0
F3nd0,"We can split the licences into several general categories, based on what they allow people to do. Sorted from most permissive:

#### Public domain

You can release your work into public domain, which basically means that you surrender your rights to it, and anyone is free to do whatever they want. Pick this if you don't care what happens with the software and you want nothing to do with it.

**[Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)** tries to do dedicate the software into public domain, but there's a small catch: The public domain is not recognised as a thing everywhere.

[**CC0**](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) fixes this by granting the user all permissions, as a fallback for when public domain wouldn't work. It's a more robust solution; at least the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) recommends it over Unlicense.

#### Pushover licences

Also known as ‘permissive’, these licences allow anyone to do pretty much anything, too, but usually they present a small requirement, like giving the author credit, or reproducing the licensing notice. Again, pick this if you don't really care what happens with the software.

**BSD** can refer to many different licences; most often it's probably the [3-clause licence](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html#licenseText). That basically just requires credit. Avoid the [4-clause licence](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-4-Clause.html#licenseText), because it's incompatible with the GPL. I see you also found a [0-clause licence](http://landley.net/toybox/license.html), which seems to present no requirements at all.

**MIT** can likewise refer to multiple licences, but people usually mean the [Expat licence](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Expat). Another variant is the [X11 licence](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:X11), which includes an additional advertising clause.

**[WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)** doesn't present any requirements. The language is a bit unusual/questionable for a legal document. It should work, but I would rather rely on a neater one.

#### Copyleft

These licences follow a simple idea: The user is free to do whatever they want, *except for* redistributing the software as non-libre. Use this if you want your program in any possible future form and all of its users to remain free.

**[LGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)** ensures that your software remains libre, but allows linking it with non-libre software. (It's a popular choice for libraries.)

**[GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)** insists that the whole work should remain libre, so it can't be linked to non-libre software.

**[AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html)** is like the GPL, but in addition, it considers providing an interface on the internet as distribution. For example, if you release a web application under the AGPL, anyone using it on their server will have to provide the complete source code to all users interacting with it over the web interface.

Hope this helps!",1533467566.0
pdp10,"They're not all similar.

* **MIT and BSD 2-clause** are essentially the same. These are considered ""permissive"" licenses, and are recommended when you want the code to be used by anyone for anything, but require that they keep the copyright holder's names attached and not claim it as their own. MIT license is now used more ubiquitously than BSD license, but there's no useful difference. MIT and BSD licenses make it very easy to combine the code with other things.

* **WTFPL** is an attempt at a license that releases into the public domain, without running afoul of laws in Europe that allegedly don't allow one to disclaim copyright and allegedly don't literally allow things to be released into the public domain. WTFPL has a flippant name that may not be appealing to some, however. **Unlicensed** seems to be the same.

* **AGPLv3** is a rather restrictive open-source license that imposes a number of obligations on those that use things licensed with it. It's the **GPLv3** plus a clause that says that you have to comply even if you don't release the software but instead run it as a service (a.k.a. SaaS or ASP). AGPLv3 and GPLv3 can make it hard to combine projects together, because projects can only be combined if the licenses are compatible.

One thing you always want to keep in mind is to use an existing license if at all possible, and don't invent your own. Well-known licenses make it straightforward to combine projects, or to know when that's not possible, instead of being subject to debate. Well-known licenses have legal precedent and legal scholarship that a custom license does not.

tdammers,"Not automatically, no. Open source has one key advantage though: that it is possible and legal for anyone to ""open it up"", audit the source, reverse engineer, and do all sorts of other things to scrutinize it.

For any given bit of software, in order to make it does what you want it to, and doesn't do what you don't want, someone you trust must scrutinize it. In the case of proprietary software, this requires permission from the vendor, and even then it's difficult to make sure the thing you're running is the exact same thing you've looked at. In the case of open source, it's trivially possible - you can build everything from source if you have to, but even if you don't, you can choose whose word you take for it. When Microsoft assures you that Microsoft code is secure, that's one thing; when a couple hundred security experts publish research that says Linux is mostly OK, and where and how it isn't, and you can hire more experts to do more independent research, then that's a different story.

But that doesn't mean the research always happens - unless someone donates time or money, it doesn't.

Another factor is who is behind the software, and what their goals are. For proprietary and free software alike, this varies between projects. Microsoft Office exists because people pay money for a license; but iOS exists because it allows Apple to sell more hardware, and gives them power over the app ecosystem for the platform, including a monopoly on software distribution (via the store). And in free software, it's the same: Debian exists because many companies and individuals benefit from a versatile, stable, battle-hardened free OS. Firefox exists because a good free browser makes it easier to sell ads on the web. vim exists because Bram Moolenaar needed a better editor than vi, wrote it, and preferred sharing freely and getting contributions over dealing with the hassle of proprietary licensing.

And this has consequences. Microsoft's corporate agenda differs from Apple's, and Debian has different priorities than Mozilla.",1533219112.0

,">This is a difficult topic, so I want to try to be clear about where on the spectrum Tildes is trying to land. I'm never going to refer to the site as a ""safe space"" or ban anyone just for occasionally acting like a jerk in an argument—I'd probably have to ban myself fairly quickly. However, it will also never be described as anything like ""an absolute free speech site"".

So it will just turn into another reddit. ""Hatespeech"" is subject to interpretation. I agree Free speech can get out of hand (see voat) but censoring discussion because you don't agree with it or find it offensive will put this site in competition with reddit. 

>Tildes prioritizes quality content and discussion through its mechanics, design, and organization. Fixation on growth and related metrics results in a bias towards high-appeal, low-depth content like funny images, gifs, and memes. Tildes will still allow that kind of content, but its priority is to cultivate high-quality communities, which are far easier to build when they don't have to fight an uphill battle against the platform itself.

Again, dicking with algorithms to promote or suppress content is going to put Tildes in competition with Reddit. 

If Tildes wants to succeed, it needs to be different. Open source code isn't going to be enough to put it into a separate market to Reddit. I keep mentioning that they need to be in their own niche, because if they aren't and are competing with sites like Reddit, they won't gain enough users and it will ultimately die. ",1532969641.0

So you expect them to pay $36/year for you to make the decision (instead of donating these $36/year to one of the projects directly). OK, let's assume these people exist.

Now, let's consider three phases of using an open-source project:

1) Learning about the project to see if it meets my needs. If it doesn’t, I would be wasting not only a few hours, but also a few dollars on something that is useless to me. (Also, a project with clear well-structured documentation would take less time and would get a smaller donation than a barely readable mess of words.)

2) Integrating the project with mine. All good, donations are well deserved.

3) Maintenance. At this stage, I am already familiar with the project and it ""just works"" within my system. I don't read its documentation anymore. So, they will receive no donation. Seems unfair...

Apparently the reason car companies were using purely-numeric model names was to ""force"" people to use the brand name. GM didn't feel it was benefiting enough from Corvette. Chrysler made the model called ""500"". It's a sort of overt branding play. Using a generic name in order to force the brand name in there is something that Microsoft would do. ""Microsoft SQL Server"" squats on a generic concept, but also encourages everyone to put the brand name in there for disambiguation.

This remark says that you are more important than the community and does come off as arrogant (regardless of the underlying intention), that's going to seed a conversation with negativity. You'll need to work on your phrasing to communicate your position without making it a negative atmosphere.

> I didn't really insult the overall community.

Intentionally or non-intentionally, you did indeed insult the community by putting yourself on a pedestal, thus creating a toxic environment for the people who fed into the initial seed of conversation.

>  If you ran across this and see people completely freaking out over 1 small thing that is said, then why would you want to deal with that community at all?

Online communities rely on the ability to communicate precise things over text and only text, which can be a challenge since without the physical gestures, pauses in language, changes in acoustic tones, etc it's hard to get to the root intent of what someone is saying. Assumptions will be made and since there are people who will contribute negatively to a community sometimes those decisions are made to label someone on the questionable side as a bad-faith actor.

>  it's much better to deal with things with open arms and not look for things that might make you mad.

EternityForest,"Distributed systems that seamlessly integrated with non-distributed ones, and that prioritize practicality. This isn't a technical challenge so much as an issue of the distributed community seems to want to replace existing tech rather than improve it, and they really like immutability, anonymity, and cryptocurrency.

Not that there's anything wrong with those things, but a ""mainstream friendly"" mesh social app is pretty much unheard of, even though it would be useful to a lot of people.


I've done a bit if research and there's quite a few challenges.

One is how do you access a piece of content without knowing where it is? It could be anywhere on the entire network, and distributed hash tables can be slow.


Blockchain issues are really only relevant to cryptocurrency. I'm not sure if CC would be world changing, or just become a new take on some of the same old problems.

But there is a question of how do you limit how often someone can dump data somewhere, in a system with no central authority. How do you keep a DHT from filling with spam records?


And how do you let people claim ownership of something resembling a domain name? How do you let users keep content that they find morally unacceptable off their own system, without opening the system to censorship?

I think something like a fully mutable encrypted BitTorrent, like a Dat archive (minus the mandatory immutable log), with no attempt at consistency beyond ""Nodes try to get the latest version of each file""could fill in for a lot of things, like social media posting and website publishing, and maybe even email.




Aside from that, it seems like a lot of the breakthroughs people are hoping for are either in hardware, not software, or they deal with really crazy data processing/machine learning stuff.


In the hardware space, there's an absolute ton of FOSS items that don't exist. I'm a little dissapointed by the lack of real tricorders. A cheap handheld multimeter-like device with a good mechanical design for adding sensors doesn't really exist.

 That doesn't really require some amazing missing puzzle pieces though, just some decent design with existing tech. It's not much more work than any of the random ESP32 game consoles out there, plus some 3D printable modular block templates that plug into the front with some pin headers.

There's not many good FOSS solar charge controllers for LiFePo4, but again, it's just a matter of doing it, the tech isn't super crazy hard.

Nobody has a cheap easy to use handheld NMR or mass spec or other ""is this water full of lead"" device. That kind of thing is pretty difficult and expensive, but ever so often someone does DIY something like that, so it's not out of reach of experimenters entirely.


Again on the topic of communications, cheap optical links might make mesh possible because laser beams don't interfere with each other.

In the US, it's complicated - the puzzle piece is regulatory. There are so many odds and ends that you must comply with, Epic becomes the de-facto choice, they've effectively cornered the market here (as well as in many Euro countries).

ReadTheArticleBitch,"**Open Source Expands In Finance With The FINOS Platform**




GreenKey Technologies,  a leader in sophisticated voice technologies primarily for the finance industry, has announced it will continue its move toward open source by contributing its GreenKey software development kit (SDK) to FINOS, the Fintech Open Source Foundation.


With GreenKey traders can combine talk with instant messaging to send messages and receive messages. Its transcription service supports compliance search and call analytics including quotes, trades, sentiment, speaker, summary, and keywords. It can also extract quotes and trades from real-time audio streams. It joins Cloud 9 in the Finos voice open source program.


“This contribution to the FINOS Voice Program is a perfect example of industry-wide collaboration to build a truly open ecosystem based on common standards across end users and even competitive technology providers.” said Gabriele Columbro, FINOS’ executive director.


All of GreenKey is moving toward open source, said Tom Schady, GreenKey’s chief technology officer.


“We’re excited to bring voice communication, backed by our innovative real-time financial transcription engine, into any JavaScript application with the SDK.  Our GreenKey back end does the heavy lifting in telephony and speech AI while our SDK lets you focus on your business and users.”


The company also plans to contribute its voice interface and financial voice skills to the FINOS Voice Program, he said.


Columbro, who had headed up the Symphony Foundation which developed open source communications for financial services firms, said FINOS is an extension of that open source fintech concept beyond communications.


“A year ago we realized there was a much broader opportunity we could pursue. After two years of building a community of trust with large firms and smaller fintech vendors, we could help these firms embrace open source collaboration,” he explained. “Almost every bit of disruption over last 20 years came from open source — big data, cloud, blockchain —would not exist without open source collaboration, he said.


The foundation expanded and launched the new FINOS brand in April. Members include many or the largest financial services firms such as Citi, Citadel, BNY Mellon, J.P. Morgan and UBS as well as technology firms such as Red Hat, openfin and information providers including Thomson Reuters and Factset.


FINOS now has eight programs:


“We have a very broad array of programs with massive uptake,” added Columbro. “We are focused on capital markets and delivering value back to our members and fintechs, but we could expand beyond capital markets. With our broad charter we could be in retail or other areas of financial services.”


The foundation has a working group for voice, he said, starting with defining meta data for voice across different vendors. Cloud 9 provided their own meta data standards and now the foundation is starting a working group for voice, which plans to define the meta data for voice across different vendors.


GreenKey is focused on transcription, and isn’t entirely open source — their back end is proprietary, he said, but they have said they will do more.Schady, GreenKey Technologies’ CTO, said the company has more plans for open source.


""GreenKey's strategy is to bring our transcription AI and telephony expertise to as broad a market as possible, by leveraging the growing open financial ecosystem.  By opening up our APIs and open sourcing all our front-end code, our clients are now limited only by their imaginations in the workflows they can accelerate with the power of voice.  Trade ticket population, real-time quote/trade capture, dictation, real-time intercom and call transcription - these are just a start.  We're excited by some of our next open source additions, such as tools to create your own custom financial voice skills (Alexa-like voice commands) powered by GreenKey.”


“With an increasing number of financial services companies looking to incorporate voice technology into their offerings for both internal teams and customers, FINOS' open source voice program provides fintech companies, developers and the broader financial services community with seamless access to voice technologies, APIs and other workflow tools,” the company said in its announcement.


In the past, advances in voice technology have required significant investments in time, labor and capital. Open source presents an opportunity to spread the development efforts across banks and fintech to reduce the cost to any one institution.

Stop right there. No. There is no fundamental difference between any of these apps. Software engineers need to stop using buzzwords for pieces of software that all share basically the same purpose, but might have different backends or frontends. I extend this to email. I have a need as a human being, to communicate in written, audio, video or symbolic form over digital mediums. I want to share information. Whatever you can do to ease that process I am thankful for.    
Email solved this problem long ago, but it's archaic. We are so used to technology and digital communication, nobody wants to type out ""Hi... Regards"" in every single email nor do I need to see your 400px height company footer. If I wanted more information I'd ask for it. Keep it simple, for the love of god. One problem with Slack is how bloated messages are. If I wanted every message to take up 400px in height on my screen I'd be using something archaic, like email.

Contributing to open source is great — I do it too!

But it’s not the only thing in life. And if anyone sets a goal of contributing to open source every single day, *including weekends*, they’re setting themselves up not only for failure, but for depression or mental illness.

By all means set goals for how much you want to contribute, and how often. But make those goals realistic, and human. Burnout is a [massive](https://medium.com/@oleg008/fighting-burnout-with-open-source-ba87559ad844) [problem](https://medium.com/@fox/the-dark-side-of-open-source-ba5a66c8a4c3) in the [open](https://thenewstack.io/darker-side-open-source/) [source](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Maintainers-Avoiding-Burnout.md) [world](https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/the-reality-of-developer-burnout), and unrealistic expectations are a contributing factor. Start by setting realistic goals for yourself, so you’re prepared to push back when other people start making unrealistic demands on your time for the contributions they want to see.

Above all, we need leaders in the open source community to model sensible, sustainable behaviour. That includes setting goals that don’t require superhuman commitment and “at any cost” thinking to achieve. Wajahat, as someone who’s blogging about open source and posting about it to Reddit, you’re a leader. Please lead in a way that everyone can follow.

jottilf,"This is exactly why I stopped putting code online many years ago, even before the days of GitHub and similar services. It is not that I do not like to share stuff that I write (I use other people's code all the time and it only seems fair), but you immediately invite all kinds of messages into your Inbox. E-mail, issue tracker, whatever. Some proverbial Inbox somewhere. It gets messages. Oh. Oh please, no. The messages! Not the messages!

People often say ""but if you share things then people will send you patches"". Yeah. Mostly, no. I got a handful of patches, no more than two or three in all that time. Otherwise you get exactly the things that the article describes. Just the fact that you feel (or at least I did back then) obligated to respond to every message means spending (read: wasting) much more time than people realise. ""An e-mail only takes a minute"". I am still waiting for someone to teach me how to write a proper message in a minute, for my definition of proper anyway. I hate canned responses myself so I do not like using those (and sending even those takes up more than zero time). Also, due to their overly generic nature they usually invite more chatter. So much wasted time with people who fail to read, never bother to search, or do not know how to logic. And oftentimes I wondered whether they were just too lazy to search and try things themselves or if they were just never taught how to do basic troubleshooting via things like elimination. I mean, I seldom if ever post questions and always manage to (eventually) figure out things myself. I do not always get it exactly right and I sometimes end up revising things later calling myself a bloody idiot. But I manage. It is just a basic skill that I could not do without. I literally could not do my job without it. And it is not limited to writing code or doing system administration things. It makes you more self reliant and less dependent on other people! Which is really great! I still do not understand why people are so often collectively unable to do this (I blow this out of proportion, but this is a twelve year old wound that this article so nicely reopened just now). So much wasted time. And all this time is wasted without doing any actual work! Imagine if you implemented every feature people asked for! On your own time! So much gratitude! But not really.

The question that riled me the most was ""why does your program/library not do X?"" when the obvious answer was of course ""because nobody wrote any code that does that"", but when you say that people call you sarcastic or even snotty. In the end I felt that putting stuff online meant doing one of two things: wasting time like this, or doing what I hate when others do it to me: ignore people's messages. You know, when they do not conform to my standards. It sounds arrogant when I write it like that, but if I phrased it any other way I would be lying. Because there have been exceptions, but the useful conversations you get are mostly with people who rarely need help with anything. Ultimately... and I just sighed out loud while writing all this.... I decided that it just was not worth it and I have kept most things to myself since. I have sent a couple of patches here and there to other projects, but that is about it. Maybe I am just not a people person. Or a nice person in general. In any case, it really is unfortunate, because open source can be such a beautiful thing... ",1531260652.0

Why? Tracking who copied from whom is not interesting and generally less valued than getting something done.

Checking against google is the best approach since that is the first thing students (I suppose this is for school/university purposes) would do. 

But again this might yield no results since a student could copy from a text source or simply from another student.

If that is what you are after, there are tools that turn text into hashes (MD5) and then check each other for similarities. We used them in my university to detect plagiarism in coding exercises.

But mostly it boils down to that the people who might be interested in the technology are the owners most of the time and they probably can already tell if they should be concerned about whether or not their document/asset has been included or not.

If you're using tons of callbacks, for example with events, instead of `something(function(){ ... })` you can write `something(function myFunctionName(){ ... })` which will make it easier to see in the call stack.

VS Code has a *Find All References* feature that will list out all the places where a variable/function is used.

one_is_the_loneliest,"I have so many issues with this article specifically and the mentality behind it generally.

Free software has little, if anything, to do with socialism or communism, and it all comes down to the force argument. Socialism and communism (in the most common formulations, obviously there are outliers) force you to be involved in their system, whereas free software and open source software only place restrictions when you choose to use someone else's work, and so are entirely voluntary. And the GPL restrictions don't even kick in if you don't distribute it (we use several modified GPL tools at my work, but we don't distribute them).

And the article is also wrong about the motivations behind each.

Free software is primarily concerned with keeping the software free, which coincidentally means that it helps users. It doesn't force anyone to contribute changes back to the project, just that modifications are available to those who receive the software.

Open source seems to be primarily concerned with encouraging use of the software, likely in an effort to increase contributions back to the project. Liberal licenses are more palatable to companies, so they're more likely to use it, and ideally they'll choose to contribute back instead of pulling it in house. However, companies often take without giving back, so it's not a flawless system.

The author is also wrong about socialism vs communism being ""essentially the same"" when you remove force. Communism is concerned with the common ownership of the means of production without social classes, money, etc. Socialism, on the other hand, is about social ownership of the means of production, and most implementations include a strong central government, social classes, and money. If anything, *socialism* is more likely to require force (we haven't had a communist state, we've only has forceful socialist states).

The biggest link between socialism/communism and open source/free software is that socialism and open source are big tents that include communism and free software respectively. You could replace socialism/communism with conservatism/alt right and be just as correct/wrong.

The ""force"" argument is tired and wrong. Nobody is forcing you to use free software.",1530624196.0

You usually have just one type of program, and if its development goes well, people are discouraged from forking it or making their own version, since it will only waste community resources.

socialism is also achieved by the state, the force of law, that is by attacking those who do not want to obey to socialism, even if they are otherwise peaceful to their fellow people : 

* ""redistribution"" is implemented by taxation, which is robbery with the threat of kidnapping [jailing]
* the story is the same with ""labor protection"" laws [for example : wage minimum]

It's like removing a feature to find out how much it will hurt them to put it in place back again. 

To sum it up, the strategic development team doesn't seem to know what they're doing. They're apparently trying to force people that want to use to move to they're own personal ""free"" license instead of using the creative common one that was created for the exact purpose of not having third party own your content. Forcing users to use the 500px royality free license could be a ""way"" to make people give rights to 500px while thinking they're still free as the CC licenses. I can't say much about the 500px license but since they claim they're changing their market model, sounds like they're trying to own everything under creative common and call it a day. Once they own the pictures under their personal license, they probably can start making money off what people release for free and off people trying to make money from those using the pictures under 500px license for commercial uses.

The article OP links to says ""This was pretty much Windows 95, 8 years before it happened."" That's not true (pedantic nitpick) because of the lack of preemptive multitasking in RISC OS at the time.

We definitely agree with Ton that money is simply a means for the creativity and ambition to create which drives OS. This is the core ideology that we have kept close and have always revisited when building [Source](https://www.source.lol/).   
Money is quite the touchy topic in regards with OSS however it is necessary for people to be able to commit time to their passion. Similar to how film makers, painters, musicians, etc all (or almost all) sell their creations in order to keep creating, there needs to be a system for OSS to funnel value to its creators. This video itself shows that clear as day when it mentioned its sponsor Poliigon.   
Essentially, Open Source cannot rely solely on donations to keep afloat. That is simply unsustainable. And not to mention ads. I personally believe that they have no place in the community.

Companies that treat these guides as a silver bullet or The One True Way to do open source never have a good experience.

Later: **Television** was made. *No ads.* Untill they came and ruined tv, 20 minutes per hour full of ads. now we have netflix and on demand services without ads. But with pay.

Later: **Internet** was open for everyone. Until companies starting making money. *With* *ads*. Adblocker being paid to allow ads (adblock plus). Anti adblocker detections. It's ridiculous. Waiting 30 seconds for a video to load to see a boring, super loud ad on youtube. Thankfull there's *Ublock Origin*

Antean,"There was an article posted about some of the issues with osm and I'm not sure where it is now, but there seem to be big issues with osm, not the least of which include conflict of interest for the people who are running the show. They have financial incentive to keep osm from being too good. Most other problems are fixable, but layers and search(data tags/crossreferencing) seem the biggest technical obstacle. The biggest overall issue is the controlling parties ability/willingness/incentive in addressing the technical side. This is all according to the article, but seems worth a mention here.

https://blog.emacsen.net/blog/2018/02/16/osm-is-in-trouble/

I only have a passing familiarity with opensource and osm. And the original post can be found doing a search for ""openstreetmaps"" on this sub, coming up just after this post.

The data is there. The usability notsomuch. At work and other times there just isn't time to fumble compared to other solutions. I'm also saying this as someone who wants to use opensource as much as possible because of it's transparency.

Edit: Ok. Having just read the piece, it mentions the article and touches on, in an avoidant manner, at least a couple of these issues. It quickly dismisses the main issue, IMO, saying ""Leaving political issues aside..."". Without fixing that, or knowing the controlling parties are morally beyond reproach, no amount of effort or collaboration can have the intended impact. It is ultimately the choices made by those who have the authority that counts.

From a modding perspective, any amount of amazing code or assets could be created and offered up to the team, but its up to the mod team itself to decide to use them, or how to implement them if they are used. All with varying impact. (I'm not great at examples).

Satellite data could be offered for free to OSM, but if and how well it's implemented makes all the difference. The main issue being the  effect on the the wallets of those who are ultimately calling the shots. It's the most basic conflict of interest. It would be foolish to undercut your own line of income(otherwise why aren't their money-making solutions incorporated into osm?). Humans gonna human.

Surely this is missing the ""paid for by Microsoft"" disclaimer on the end?

I don't just judge them by past actions, which are not ""mixed"" but damn right hostile.

I judge them by the on going patent protection racket they still use to milk many Linux/Android using companies who don't use any MS code.

I judge them by their aggressive corrupting of local government in Munich.

I judge them on how they treat their OS users and the whole home and office markets.

I judge them on how they don't get involved with LibreOffice to explain how to import their ""documented open standards"" properly. Alongside how badly they do importing LibreOffice formats when the reference code is right there as well as the documented standard. Interoperability is something they have always avoided/fought and continue to do so.

I judge them by the peppering of ThreadAPI_Sleep(1) in main loops of threads in their ""embedded"" Azure code. Nanosleep calls shouldn't show up in profiling! The pattern involved is literally in text books as bad practice. 

If you mix in their past actions and that the whole time their PR and fan boys have been trying to tell me it's a ""new Microsoft"", then how can I be expected to believe it this time?

The only reason they are doing any of this open source work is because they have to because the world has changed and continues to change. **They make their money by selling closed software. Everything they do is to try and keep that relevant and direct/trap people to buying it.** Just like Oracle and Apple. Google aren't really any better, but they are more an ad company so are playing a different game. Though the pay with data game is one everyone is joining in and still requires closed software.

Often to fix a bug or to create a new feature they want.

For example a music player can only play .wav songs that are shorter than 5 minutes? Someone else can come along, implement mp3 support and remove the time limit.

Sometimes software someone wrote has no commercial value. For example, you can write your own office ""word"" text editing/formatting software, but nobody is going to use it, because word, libreoffice writer and latex are better. But maybe it can still be of some use to someone else?

Now you come along, take my design, add grommet holes to the desk for your wires. This new design works for you. Perhaps you publish your new design on your website.

So you changed my design, but it doesn't mean you can publish your changes on my website. I own the control over the design hosted on my site even if you're allowed to change it. You might send me your suggested improvement, but it's up to me if I want to accept them.

As to why, perhaps they developed it as part of a company but it's not part of what makes the company money. In that case releasing it might generate good-will and might also get other people to help build the thing. Or maybe it's a project they're passionate about and they want to help for those reasons. Or maybe it's an open-source project used by a company and that company is willing to pay developers to improve it.

Also you're probably not going to take a few months to learn a codebase, you're much more likely to start with making small improvements that help you (and others) work better.

gopherman12,"From discussion in another thread -

Advantages of Corgi over creating shell functions to reuse commands:

1. More entry-level friendly: For non-expert in Shell/Bash (including me without surprise), Corgi provides an interactive interface that doesn’t require a user to learn how to define functions in shell or manage its complexity

2. Management: corgi manages your snippets for you under the hood, you don’t need to remember where you put your shell script or try to infer what they do by looking at file names or code. Corgi provides an interactive search interface that let’s you find your snippet quickly, and a “describe” action that allows you to know what your snippet does without looking at actual code

3. Execution flexibility: if some function failed to run in the middle of running your shell script, you’d have to rerun everything again or comment out code to run the remaining commands. But corgi let’s you continue from where you failed by simply specifying a step range with the “—step” flag

4. Template: while achievable by shell function too, corgi’s interface for template/argument could be applied across commands, and it’s more intuitive to use (for non-expert I guess)

5. Better formatted output: you’ll know exactly which step failed with the colorized step-scoped output, no more code digging to find the bad function call

There could be more as more use cases being explored.. I’m thinking about adding remote server configuration so that corgi can run your command seamlessly on a remote server without typing all the “ssh”",1528780834.0

Open source is ""statement"" about the availability of sourcecode and what rights you have to work with that source code...nothing further.

They already allowed you to spin your own project based on their work if you disagree with their decisions...you are not entitled to them having to follow any wishes you might have. 

There are plenty of examples of open source projects making ""political"" decisions about the functionality of their projects: KDE's kate editor disallowing being started as root, ssl refusing to work with key files with world-read permissions, python adding the `from __future__ import braces` easteregg...If you really wanted any of this you can add it yourself (or remove the check the sourcecode does to prevent something)...that's the freedom open source gives you.

This ""feature"" you mentioned in itself isn't _against_ Free Software, nor does it violates its spirit. It's more that it doesn't concern it, not that it's the opposite of what you think.

As you mentioned, since the code is Free Software a community can be formed around the program, and someone can make it so it works in a way you desire.

I guess the question now is what, specifically, will it mean for Microsoft to *empower developers*, how exactly will they be providing these *great tools*, and what happens to the *great technology* these developers create?

The article talks about Microsoft's mission, written plainly on their official about page of their website to do just this; I'm inclined to believe that, but they are -- after all -- a for-profit organization, and I have no doubt that will come into play somewhere in GitHub's future.

The article finishes by saying that GitHub had never turned a profit, and that Microsoft's acquisition is justified in order to keep it from disappearing for lack of funds. No doubt that GitHub will likely never go down, now, with the financial backing from Microsoft, but that immortality comes with a price, and only time will tell us what that price is.

mojosam,"Moronic analysis by a clueless Microsoft shill. Maybe this is what Microsoft hopes, but it shows they are just as delusional. Here's the amazing logic behind this pronouncement:

>For enterprises, Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) will provide an easy path for transitioning from open source software, distributed on GitHub, to enterprise-scale applications running on the Microsoft Azure cloud.

Which, of course, doesn't require Microsoft to acquire GitHub. If Microsoft has some secret sauce that makes it both easy and desirable to transition from open source -> Azure Cloud, that would work even without Microsoft owning GitHub. And Microsoft owning GitHub does nothing to make that easier or more desirable; the only thing it might do is give Microsoft a platform to advertise to open source users and developers, but that's only if projects don't abandon GitHub en masse.

>For developers, Microsoft will provide tools, and increased profits via access to enterprise and other customers.

Empty jibberish, and again, nothing to do with GitHub; if Microsoft has plans to provide tools to do this via GitHub, they could do that without owning GitHub. Here's a probably more astute analysis of the motivation from Harvard Business Review:

>It’s paying for the access it gets to the legions of developers who use GitHub’s code repository products on a daily basis (the company’s strategic value) — so they can be guided into the Microsoft developer environment, where the real money is made.

But on what planet are open source developers going to want to pay to migrate to ""Microsoft's developer environment"", which presumably only has incremental benefits over what's available elsewhere. And that assumes that there aren't downside to jumping in bed with Microsoft, which we all know that there are going to be.",1528395556.0

Why would they do this? For all the same reasons everyone else likes Open Source, sure--but also because they want .Net to be more mainstream and acceptable in the Open Source community.

dmethvin,"The Skype acquisition *was* a mess, but remember that happened while Ballmer was in charge. They had their own conferencing app called Lync (later renamed Skype for Business with a bit of irony) so internally I suspect there were some turf wars that may have hurt Skype. Even in its current state it's much less of a resource hog on video calls than Google Hangouts.

I don't think the GitHub acquisition will play out the same way as Skype. For one thing, there's different leadership. They'd much rather for example, improve integration with Azure so that projects can be CI-tested and deployed easily, and they'll make money off Azure as people build cloud-based services off of it.

SanityInAnarchy,"1. Skype used to be actually peer-to-peer, and had an okay (not great) Linux client. After the MS acquisition, the Linux client was mostly abandoned, which was almost a blessing, because the other client started to suck. They also moved towards sending everything through central servers, making it really easy to wiretap them. I don't know much about most other acquisitions -- the other obvious one is Bungie, who used to be a huge developer of Mac games, so Halo might've been a Mac exclusive, until MS bought them and it was suddenly an Xbox exclusive... but that's debatable, because I doubt they could've made anything as good as Halo independently, without the massive amount of cash MS has to sink into projects it likes.
2. They seem to have, but it's hard to really tell, because they're in a different position than they were back then. When IE won the browser wars (around IE6), they pretty much abandoned it (and the Web) until Firefox became relevant, and they still didn't actually start to have good support for Web standards until Chrome started kicking their ass. Sure, Edge is starting to be an okay browser now that it's a minority, but we have yet to see MS treat the Web properly when they actually have a majority of the market, let alone a near-monopoly like they did back in IE6.
3. I have no idea. Sounds like someone who is concerned about privacy, and about all the data Facebook and Google collect, yet inexplicably not at all concerned about how desperately MS has been trying to do the exact same thing with Win10.
4. Well, Github was never open source in the first place. GitLab is, which is why people have gone there. I can't tell you what you should use, though -- for a long time, Github has been such a defacto standard that many people wouldn't even bother sending you patches unless you had a fork there. The nice thing about Git is, you don't necessarily have to choose right away -- if I were you, I'd at least have mirrors in both places while you wait to see how this shakes out.

Use this [tool](https://www.saveyourinternet.eu/) to ensure your representative is speaking up and stopping rules that impose censorship through content filtering.

You can use our points below to help construct an original message in your own words.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**What to write?**

- Creativity and free speech will be harmed by Article 13 because algorithms struggle to tell the difference between infringement and the legal use of copyrighted material vital to research, commentary, parodies and more. This is far too high a cost for enforcing copyright. 

- No filter can possibly review every form of content covered by the proposal including text, audio, video, images and software. Article 13's mandate is technically infeasible and it is absurd to expect courts in 27 EU Member States to be constantly working out what the “best” filters might be.

- It is a bad idea to make Internet companies responsible for enforcing copyright law. To ensure compliance and avoid penalties, platforms are sure to err on the side of caution and overblock. To make compliance easier, platforms will adjust their terms of service to be able to delete any content or account for any reason. That will leave victims of wrongful deletion with no right to complain – even if their content was perfectly legal.

However, if you were to just understand how the library works, and then implement the same functionality from scratch yourself, you would be free to license it in any way you like.

In practice, proving things either way is difficult, exactly because it isn't documented anywhere how you came up with the code - the same code can be the result of a series of incremental rewrites, which would make it a derived work, or a from-scratch effort based on knowledge gained from studying the original, which would not usually be considered a derived work.

You could be looking for a few different pieces: 1) Application/website that has custom content 2) kiosk system software that turns that custom content into a self-service kiosk (custom navigation, device lockdown, secures the device to only display the custom content you want to allow.

You can easily purchase kiosk system software - usually a perpetual (one time) license. The cost is minimal considering the time it would take to do this on your own. You can demo most good solutions for free, then license when you are ready. Examples include: [KioWare (for Windows or Android)](https://m.kioware.com), SiteKiosk (Windows or Android). Or if you aren't picky about it being Windows, Porteus for Linux. Kiosk Pro (for iOS). Surelock.

If you need assistance with developing the application itself, you can either do that part on your own (just basic web development, wordpress, or another easy web building solution), you can outsource to a web development/app development resource, or you can look to the kiosk experts. You'll want to start with a storyboard of the app/UX before you try to get pricing, if you decide to go the custom route. I know KioWare offers that kind of custom development, but not sure about the others. [Here's a worksheet](https://m.kioware.com/docs/CustomDevWorksheet.pdf) you can use to gather your project specs so any quotes you request are consistent. The worksheet includes hardware questions, but you get the idea.

TLDR: Kiosk system software will make this inexpensive. You can do it all yourself using a web app. If you don't want to do it yourself, or can't figure out the payment piece, you can look into custom dev to fill the holes.

if OS stops doing that for some reason \(crash/BSOD/driver crash\) it will not write to it and system should reboot itself after 1m or so.

There are software solutions but in your case i think only solution is to see if you do have something like that in BIOS/UEFI to enable

for example this is what i have on my Linux box \(sorry no windows here :\) \)

    steki@pc:~> dmesg |grep -i watc
    [    0.080163] NMI watchdog: Enabled. Permanently consumes one hw-PMU counter.

AdamColligan,"*Question:*  
Is there a comprehensive strategy for supporting touchscreen laptop and workstation configurations as first-class ""desktop"" citizens? 

*Rant:*  
This has been a [blocking issue keeping me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/594zmu/what_is_everyones_favorite_desktop_environment/d960f26/), as a hybrid user, from switching to KDE-based distros for years. Now, my niche segment has become the ascendant force in sales in the consumer (and increasingly the [corporate](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3211051/mobile-wireless/your-next-company-computer-may-be-a-2-in-1-laptop.html)) hardware market. But even though that trend has been building for a long time, and even though the Wayland switch has offered an opportunity to take a fresh look at input, I haven't seen it reflected in KWin/Plasma/etc much at all. 

- Touch the screen in X, get a cursor sitting forever covering whatever you were trying to interact with. Touch the screen in Wayland, and you can't actually move or get rid of the mouse/touchpad cursor at all. Gnome/Unity, Windows, and I think other UI designs have long dealt with this more or less sanely: do the click action and then hide or kill the cursor. Or let the user choose something?
- No settings GUI (or even documented DIY settings processes) for touchscreens comparable to touchpads. No (or almost no?) native multitouch/gesture support for touchscreens, and no clear way to configure it, so no general [two-finger scrolling](https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/4y5j83/waylandlibinput_touchscreen_scrolling/), for instance.
- I'm not sure whether the virtual keyboard experience has improved of late, but I don't remember it as a smooth or pleasant one, and I think [users may still be struggling](https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=289&t=142916&p=385962&hilit=touch#p385962).

I do occasional searches for KDE + touchscreen issues, and there are just always these [recurring themes](https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=152414&p=398623&hilit=touchscreen#p398623) or [basic problems](https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=150953&p=396161&hilit=touch#p396161) with very [little traction](https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=141026&p=395993&hilit=touch#p395993). 

Since sophisticated pen inputs are growing in popularity and more exotic pointing/hover behavior is on the horizon as a mainstream concept, I worry that things could fall even further behind. Canonical, Microsoft, etc. have ditched the bad idea that thorough touch support is something that lives in mobile device development land -- or that what hybrid or touch workstation desktop users want is to run a phone OS. And I don't know enough about whether Plasma Mobile's development work will be easily portable back to mainline desktop software, but I doubt that is the focus or priority in any case.


I also don't know enough about Wayland or KWin's implementation to know how much behavior is baked in and how much is exposed for users or third-party developers to implement better functionality through editing files or writing add-ons. I really appreciate Martin Flöser's work on [some of the back-end nuts and bolts](https://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2017/02/how-input-works-touch-input/) or Plasma's [introduction of automatic calibration](https://news.opensuse.org/2018/02/23/what-is-new-with-kdes-plasma-5-12-in-opensuse-leap/). But there's a big difference between component work and a serious project decision to take something that is central to the hardware interface and make it central to the software interface.

Now the question: Is there any chance that your goals will also have a focus on Plasma Mobile?

Greetings,

Spookje

Edit bonus: Say I'd like to know more about development \(since I'm mostly admin right now\) how could I start learning so I could turn it into helping the Plasma Mobile project?",1527263585.0
solpaadjustmadisar,"- Where do you guys get your funding from (money)? Who support and sustain you?

- The integration with Nvidia GPU seems less stable compared to GNOME's, would there be any improvements there?

- The shortcuts seem very different from say windows/gnome is there a plan to align to the same. I miss the win+arrow keys to move the windows

- The section to choose a different method to input, change keyboard language seems like a maze I can't get out of.

- Your(Kubuntu 17.10) dark theme is significantly better than Gnomes. So thank you for that.

- KDE connect is great.

Plasma's ux needs work. To me, this is the worst part of plasma. Like: font selection, colors, icons, inversion of font color on selection in menus... basically, everything. Recently people are mostly moving to papirus and e.g. arc (based on shared screenshots I've seen). Are there plans to redesign the theme (the only one that works actually is breeze and I really dislike design decisions there) and make it easier to make new ones?


Plasma seems more performant than gnome, but somehow feels over engineered. Too many options that are there just sitting unused. To be honest, in this area I like GNOME's approach where they think about what is being used, cut unused parts. Any chance to see KDE move just *a bit* in this direction?


Looking at discover, do you plan to force mobile UI on desktop for other apps as well?


I caught one comment saying  that bugzilla will be migrated to phabricator or something else. But I caught one more comment from Nate saying there won't be. What is the opinion of this? Gnome's move to gitlab was well accepted...


KDE's website is quite bad. Documentation is outdated, finding some article had content only a link to some other location. Any chance to hard-reset it and use something that works on mobile? Also to consolidate whole website so it feels like one whole instead of fragmented as it is now (documentation, issue tracker, homepage: all look like they don't belong together)?


Kde store: settings app through which extensions are installed is confusing. Multiple sources for a single item, half of them don't work... Any plans to improve this?


Will there be consolidation of projects/apps? E.g. there are no SQL front ends, but there are 3-4 media players with basically same functionality. Libreoffice vs calligra? Never met someone that used or recommended calligra to be honest. Is this a wasted effort? I know that this is driven by community, but still, guidance here seems to be missing.


Any chance to have e.V. do some magic to pull money from EU and fund several developers working full time on plasma?


To me it seems there is a mismatch between what users want and what KDE delivers. Will you do a reach out to users asking for feedback (market research)?  There have been some attempts on reddit (done by Nate... much appreciated BTW), but in a bigger scale?

1) Are you going to support OMEMO and XEP-0280 any time soon?  These seem to be standard implementations for apps these days.

2) Where's the folder so that I can delete it to reset every setting related to the instant messenger/chat app?  I would appreciate not having to delete a bunch of other settings to get it taken care of.

I ask the second question because the ""theme"" that I'm using causes a jitter of the message area making it hard to read, and that jitter interferes with my scrollback in the conversation.  The only way to overcome it is to reduce the font size.  With my aging eyes that makes reading the conversation difficult.

I'd have much more preferred if we were given actual useful classes that taught us how a computer works and how to make it work for you, instead of just teaching you how to become dependent on proprietary programs.

I am very much in favour of at least basic programming classes, even if it's only ""how to automate [some simple task] with a shell script"".

Things like ""how to install a computer"" would be useful too, I think. This would make it easier for people to use the OS that they actually prefer. Nowadays, most systems come with Windows by default, and the average human doesn't know there's alternatives, let alone how to get those running on their hardware.

zfundamental,"In my opinion learning to code should not be mandatory for all, though individuals should have the opportunity to learn it if they're interested. Additionally the problem solving skills learned in traditional programming classes should be present in the educational system.

In order to make key concepts teachable I would recommend avoiding the standard technologies python/js/C++/java/etc/etc and advocate for the integration of what is essentially obsolete technology into the educational pipeline. This can be something like BASIC on TI calculators for instance since many students can have tangential exposure to it. It's simple enough for students to learn about, it's old enough that there may be pre-existing resources for both students and teachers to fall back upon, and it's not something radically new for teachers to learn. If teachers are expected to teach programmatic problem solving skills well (i.e. without making the process boring, driving students away), then it has to be something with a level of complexity that they're ok with talking about.

I recall one standard program that was taught in some of the lower levels of math was a Pythagorean triangle calculation app. It's something that's a simple direct integration of programming concepts without the depth to drive students away. For higher level math it's fairly natural to get into some light programming when dealing with plotting functions, so that's a reasonable path to teach some pseudo-programming along the way.

For earlier age brackets I think programming concepts are interesting, but involving a computer itself can drive people away (teachers or students). Physical aids can be a big thing here to keep the students interested and to keep the lesson plans grounded. Extending the idea of using obsolete technology, consider using a robot like the original [turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot\)) robot, but supplied with instructions through literal punch cards. Students get physical responses for what they tell the robot to do all the while avoiding the distractions common in computer labs.

All in all, programming provides opportunities to learn problem solving skills, but for pedagogical purposes, if you're teaching everyone something, it should not get caught up on syntax errors, library quirks, or other errata. They're key to practically using a real computer language, but not for getting the benefits in a more broad sense (IMO).",1526562941.0
lukedeux,"Interesting article, and I like your take on the subject. 

I would argue that saying coding is as necessary as reading is greatly over inflating its importance. Yes, being tech savvy is becoming increasingly important in today's job market but that doesn't necessarily involve an understanding or ability to write code but rather just a gasp on what is being used that has already been created. For many professions (plumbing, landscaping, farming, etc) learning to code would be almost pointless. Sure you could argue that they could develop apps or systems to better their efficiency in some cases bit on the whole they'd be better off just showing a demand for it in the market. 

I will say that having better access in schools, with knowledgeable teachers, should become more and more of a priority, but I would never venture to say it should be mandatory or even part of a core curriculum.

This can also be observed in the title ""Dear Comrade"": Buying is better than sharing. Okay, under these conditions you just need tons of money, agreed.

I am a DevOps Engineer for the better part of three decades now. We do open Source solutions and we make our money with the support, like every big company out there too. We took open Source tools to make this happen, like the OP. Those compilers, tools and even the OS were free and open I wager. And whatever the op tried to explain does also apply to those developers of those items. Still, they make good money.

RedHat is selling Open Sourced software and even allowing other projects to redistribute their stuff (CentOS) and make a killing on the go. Github is filled with open Source projects that are above and beyond ""Broke"". RocketChat, a permier solution for Chatting does follow the same path.

The smaller projects may wither and die; but those on github get picked up and gain continued development by others. And everyone in there is innovating to. That's the beauty of 2018+: We do not have to buy software; we can, in collaboration, clone and rewrite the good tools and make them free again (See Winamp, WinZip and about a ton of others). Hell, even Microsoft is (was?) thinking about open Sourcing Windows and making it free as the classical approach to gain money seem to no longer apply in the digital world of 2018.

The issue can also be observed with print media; they are currently in the process of becoming extinct albeit this will take several decades, still the dwindling subscription numbers are alarming, so they say. Then they moved to online media, trying to make money there. But online means people have several ways of reaching their goal. At first they tried to use/employ paywalls. It just did not work, people just 'googled' what they wanted and got their information 'somewhere else'. Then came the ads, killed by adblockers.

[Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) is probably the best option in terms of their infrastructure being reliable, but it is purely text based with no other kind of media.

I figure you could use syncthing or a similar app to keep some markdown files synced against a server somewhere. That way you could just open Markor and edit your todo lists and reference files, then when you weren't looking they would get synced up to the server, and the reverse of course.


Of all of these options, I am currently test driving Joplin, but I think I will settle on the last option.

From my own perspective I've seen these two viewpoints clash with regards to project forks (mostly in regards to a ~10 year old fork of a ~15 year old). The ability for a project to fork is a great asset within opensource, though using it does fracture things (devs/contributors/users/etc). Some could view this competition as a driving factor to make this better and in that case /u/aesamattki's point is pretty valid.

In my book however if you hit the point where a new project doesn't create a new influx of contributors/users/etc then it does end up devolving into a combative competition where in the end the users don't benefit from the existence of many options. This is compounded by projects struggling to keep contributors interested when it appears to get diminished by what can seem to be counter-productive work of others on different projects.

OvidPerl,"First, please use `strict` and `warnings` in your code. In particular, using `strict` will protect you from the trap of using undeclared variables (I'm looking at you, Python). For example, you have a line of code where you have `print “Size: “,scalar @array, “\n”;`, but `@array` isn't a used. That's why it prints ""0"" in your code. With `strict` and a relatively modern Perl, I would do something like this:

    say sprintf ""Side: %d"", scalar @days;

Also, with a modern Perl you don't need to write this:

    sub Average
    { $n=scalar(@_);
    $sum=0;
    foreach $item (@_)
    {
    $sum+=$item;
    }

You can write this:

    sub average (@numbers) {
        my $num_elements = @numbers;
        my $sum          = 0;

        # this can be written even simpler, but I'm showing ""beginning"" Perl here
        foreach my $number (@numbers) {
            $sum += $number;
        }
        return $sum / $num_elements;
    }

(The final `return` is not really needed as Perl returns the last item evaluated)

And iterating directly over elements of loops is preferred. This is harder to understand (and maintain, if the size is variable):

    @days = qw/Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun/;
    print “$days[0]\n”;
    print “$days[1]\n”;
    print “$days[2]\n”;
    print “$days[3]\n”;
    print “$days[4]\n”;
    print “$days[5]\n”;
    print “$days[6]\n”;

Instead:

    my @days = qw/Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun/;
    foreach my $day (@days) {
        say $day;

# What Happened to Perl?

This is a repost of a Quora answer I gave about [why Perl fell out of favor](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Perl-fall-out-of-favor/answer/Curtis-Poe).

Back in the 1990s, merely having the letters ‘H’, ‘T’, ‘M’ and ‘L’ on your CV (and not necessarily in that order) meant a fat pay raise. People were building complex nested tables for layout, using the &NBSP; empty table cell workaround for Netscape, and sprinkling font tags everywhere like fairy dust. To be honest, it was a pretty exciting time in the programming industry because nobody knew where we were going, but it was a lot of fun getting there.

So the mail room clerk gets asked to learn this HTML stuff (remember when DHTML was a thing?) and after six months, realizes he can double his salary by becoming a “Webmaster” somewhere else. There was such a huge demand for developers in the first dot-com boom that the people who were doing this were often people with zero programming background. Keep that in mind.

Eventually, organizations realized that manually curating tons of documents was a lot of busy work, so it was time to automate some of this. Server Side Includes (SSIs) meant that you could dynamically update all sorts of information on your pages, but they were limited and support for their features was rather hit or miss.

Then there was also Mocha … wait no, it’s LiveScript! … wait no, it’s JavaScript! …

JavaScript allowed for a little more dynamism, but its support was also rather flaky and back then many people disabled it.

The only serious way of getting the results you wanted was with a robust server side language. Remember that many of the people tasked with doing this had no programming background. Asking them to write C (or even Java when it came out) was a non-starter, but this Perl thing was very forgiving. And then these developers discovered Matt’s Script Archive and the joy of FormMail, a message board, a simple search engine, and many other tools that required a little customization and then you had a dynamic web site!

Unfortunately, the gentleman who wrote these was an inexperienced high school student at the time, and he wrote (by his own admission) awful code. And this is what many people with zero programming experience used to learn programming. But the amazing thing is that it worked. Perl was spreading everywhere and it became known as “the duct tape of the internet.” It was the tool for writing dynamic web sites and its popularity exploded.

At the same time, hackers were having a field day exploiting the security holes these inexperienced developers were creating, and generally causing chaos. People were saying that not only was Perl code ugly, but it was insecure. “Ugly” is subjective, but insecure is definitely not true. Inexperienced developers who knew nothing about security were giving Perl a bad reputation.

So that’s the foundation. What happened next? Economics.

Ask any economist what will happen when a single product dominates a lucrative market with no barrier to entry. You will soon have multiple products in that space. That’s exactly what happened with Perl.

PHP, despite its shortcomings, started eating Perl’s market share because of how easy it was to use, and the fact that it was often enabled on Web servers by default.

Python (an awesome language) is the go to language for many people who are obsessed with clean looking code. And it competes against Perl nicely.

Ruby exploded onto the scene near the end of 2006, shortly after Perl’s popularity had peaked.

It was around that time that we saw bloggers, many of whom (rightfully) despised the Perl spaghetti code written by amateurs, and not understanding economics, started blogging about Perl’s demise, not realizing that Perl’s market share had to shrink while the market matured and competitors crowded in. Unfortunately, this was repeated often enough that hiring managers sometimes started getting panicky about the language, despite the large community, causing a weird feedback loop.

(There was also a bit of confusion over the role of Perl 6 which added to this. Even to this day, many people do not realize that Perl 6 is a separate language and not an “upgrade” path for Perl 5.)

So the Perl community rallied, started putting out regular releases of Perl, started pushing “Modern Perl” and encouraging developers to use it, and generally just carrying on. And something curious happened: Perl’s popularity stabilized about two or three years ago. I had been predicting this for a long time because it’s something one would expect, economically, and it finally arrived.

There are still many companies out there who use Perl (and yes, that includes startups) and when we started All Around the World consulting, I expected that we’d be doing a lot of work refactoring legacy code—something I specialize in—but we didn’t; we’re mostly doing new development. Some of my favorite projects:

* ETL system to reduce costs of Phase III clinical trials
* Real-time monitoring of a countrywide [redacted] infrastructure
* [Building a text-based sci-fi MMORPG](https://taustation.space/)

For one project, we were replacing an older system written in a rather popular language with Perl. When I asked the client why, they replied “we’re tired of being bitten by hype.”

Perl’s battle-tested. Battle-scarred, yes, but battle-tested. It weathered a terrible storm of multiple competing languages, and has come through nicely. A new version is released every year or so, the language continues to modernize, and via Moose it has one of the most advanced OO systems you’ll find. It also has several excellent web frameworks and the testing tools are great (though I’m biased because I’ve written many of them).

So Perl’s still out of favor for some, but I’ve been pleased to see that it’s still doing well and there’s a lot of new development in it.",1525881586.0

Ramin_HAL9001,"This was a good article for introducing Perl. Unfortunately, I disagree with the premise.

I remember I first learned Perl a long time ago, back in my graduate school days. I especially like the improved regular expression language, and how it made improvements over AWK. But there are several problems with it that eventually made it useless to me:

* There is no clean, easy, built-in functionality for Bourne-shell-like process pipelines, which is an important feature of Bourne-shell-like languages. This makes it difficult to compose AWK-like functions written in Perl.
* Perl has references and indirection which are often a good way to solve problems, but there is no (EDIT) *static*  type checking system, so it is sometimes very difficult to find bugs caused by incorrect dereferencing. A lack of type checking is a weakness for many languages, including Perl, Python, Ruby, and Scheme, so Perl is **at least** as difficult to debug as Python or Ruby, however....
* The syntax is much more ugly and difficult to understand compared to Python or Ruby. It is sometimes impossible for me to understand code written by other people without asking them what it does, especially for small throw-away scripts that have no comments written into it. With other languages, you can often just Google search for a keyword or symbol. But Perl often uses weird syntactical constructs, and you cannot Google for syntax, because Google requires keywords in order to do a search.

I usually recommend Haskell because it has a clean syntax and static type checking, and does provide functionality similar to Bourne-shell-like process pipelines with the ""Monadic bind"" `>>=` operator and list comprehension, although if you do want to manipulate the filesystem it is better to import a library like ""Turtle"" which provides better shell-like functionality.",1525856434.0

Within their original crowdfunding and voting approach mentioned on indiegogo they seem to have a few missteps including the expectation of large up-front investments, expectation of the reliability of crowd-sourced feature voting (this tends to result in strange feature-sets driven by vocal minorities), and they're attempting to motivate OSS developers by $ rather than making them users of the software and then supplementing the situation with $.

The current call for devs/testers/etc seems to miss the tone present in other open source projects as well.

SanityInAnarchy,"The presentation is nice, but it needs a little nuance and a little fact-checking, I think. For example:

> Some software, like Photoshop, isn't renowned for spying or targeted advertising, but rather comes with a massive up-front cost. Adobe Photoshop costs $240 anually[4] for a license, and Microsoft's Visual Studio (code editor) costs $539, also anually.[5]

Photoshop costs $120 annually for students; VS has a Community Edition that is literally free. And that's just the deals you find online -- when I was a student, my CS department had just about every product Microsoft made available for pennies, thanks to deals like [MSDNAA](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/gautam/2008/11/05/what-is-msdn-academic-alliance-msdnaa/). You could argue in principle that the school shouldn't be paying for such a thing, but there are very few students in the western world who *can't* get their hands on a reasonably-priced copy of professional software. The first hit's free, after all.

There's a lot of this kind of stuff missing from the argument. For example:

> Google stores every search you ever make, your entire browser history in Google Chrome; and in other browsers, browsing history and analytics from millions of websites.

Most of this can be disabled or deleted at your request. Pointing this out would actually make your argument *stronger,* I think, because then you'd get to link to [this very creepy look into everything Google knows about you](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity) -- but it does give you controls to delete stuff, or prevent it from being collected in the first place.

So this reads like a lot of rhetoric, instead of substance. It's popular rhetoric, so I expect I'll get some downvotes here, but I really think you'd convince more people with a more accurate, fairer summary.

You at least need some weasel words:

> Free and Open Source software does not spy on you.

ahfoo,"It would be lovely if this were true and it seems like an obvious fit at first glance but unfortunately there is a bit of a gotcha in this connection. It has to do with the role of institutions in society. Education, on the face of it, seems to be the sharing of wisdom and the love of learning but schools are actually far from places where such principles take priority. 

In fact, schools serve less as places for learning and more as places for socialization and establishing behavioral norms through conditioned response. Schools are more about crafting newly minted consumers for the economic system than about learning as such and the economic system of post-industrial capitalism places an enormous emphasis on promoting the notion of intellectual property.

You would think that schools would be a perfect fit for open source and that thought has been in wide circulation for many decades but as the years wind on and the situation becomes worse and worse it becomes apparent that schools will ironically be the very last institution to actually accept anything that challenges that dominant economic model. The good news is that when this finally does begin to happen it will mean the dominant economic model is changing. Are we there yet?

Schtecke,"First of all, this is not anymore an open source license according to any standard definition of open source. Secondly, there are all kinds of problems that come from trying to limit in the license what people can or can't do with the software. From the license page:

>    violence, hate and division,
>   environmental destruction,
>  abuse of human rights,

edhelas1,"Hi, thanks for your interest in Movim :) I'm the maintainer of the project.

It's a lot of questions so I'll try to explain how the Communities are working at the moment. 

The Communities on Movim are actually hosted on XMPP services accross the XMPP network (like everything else presented on Movim). Movim is ""just"" a client accessing them, the same way he access user profiles or chatrooms.

""Movim"" is actually two things, the project itself (which is basically an advanced XMPP client with social and IM features) and the services (mostly the XMPP movim.eu server and related services, pubsub/news/comics/conferences….eu). All the pods are simply Movim instances deployed on web servers that are accessing those XMPP servers and related services.

The main idea of the project is to actually reuse the XMPP network and the thousands (millions?) of accounts available and build a social network on top better than having to recreate from scratch the whole network. This is working quite well for the IM part (chat, profiles, chatrooms) but the goal is also to push the social part (Blogs and Communities) which is a bit more difficult. Actually not a lot of XMPP servers offers related Pubsub services to allow Movim to create Communities. We are actively working with XMPP server projects to be sure that they are respecting the standard (mostly defined here https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html) and we are now explaining admins how to add this service to their XMPP server (https://github.com/movim/movim/wiki/Configure%20ejabberd#pubsub).

This is starting to show results for the Blog part (publishing messages on your own profile), a bit less for the Communities as well. This is caused by this network effect (Movim is one of the first project to push this ""social"" part of XMPP) but also a lack of clarity in the UI and the architecture (all the questions you asked are also showing that). 

We are planning to do some work to clarify that situation. First by doing a clear separation between the project and the services.",1524998266.0

zfundamental,"> What do you think about them?

It depends on what aspect you want to talk about. GSoC and Outreachy provide a way of getting some stuff done, providing a structure for mentorship, and helps PR/promotion of a project. Additionally GSoC offers funding for the internships. If I read the terms correctly for Outreachy they require projects to bring their own funding.

I think stuff like GSoC is a great way to help projects along and provide the interns with a cool experience which will deepen their knowledge. You can argue that the bar is too high for both projects and interns, though I'm not sure how you get around that issue.

If you have someone who has already extensively contributed to a project applying to take an internship on it, then they simply have a leg up on other applicants. I think it's against the spirit of getting new people involved, though picking someone already familiar with a project or a domain does increase the odds of them getting stuff done during the time.

Overall I think GSoC is a great thing and I haven't seen enough about Outreachy in a practical sense to be able to judge their program too much (though outreachy is much less relevant for my own interests as a small project can't be expected to bring the funds that they require and if they could it would likely be better spent through other means).",1524962132.0

Also, it would be nice if the ROC curve legend was regenerated so that it shows which line is the dashed line (it's fairly obvious on the main plot, but it does look a bit silly at the moment).

One last question: Do you expect the performance desegregation to show different results if non-white noise is used in testing? I would expect white noise to be easier for the ML to handle compared to a non-flat spectrum or even a non-stationary non-flat spectrum.",1524666799.0
Schtecke,"I never understood why people started using Slack. It has small practical advantages over IRC, but none over other free solutions like Matrix. Certainly nothing valuable enough to give away control so completely.

There's a pattern I see repeating over and over again in different services (Google, Facebook, Slack, etc.): there's something new, exciting and proprietary; people start using it; the proprietary service eventually wants to make money; people are outraged since they have trusted too much of their lives to this service. It's a new business strategy that works by capturing network effects: first appear to be free and benign, and start being evil and making money only after you have captured all the people and they can't individually change the service anymore.

There is a generic solution to all this that doesn't require people to bang their heads repeatedly to various proprietary walls: don't use these services. If you can't get the code and run your own instance of the service if needed, you are bound to hit these problems eventually.",1524674480.0

Even if that was possible I don't think it this approach would be acceptable unless there was an astounding amount of data which the companies to be tested could not directly access.

zfundamental,"The title of the original post seems clear enough, but the content seems to be more of a ""help list out other OSS CAD implementations not in the original text post"". 

Per the original title in the general CAD-ish space I've used (or attempted to use): Blender, Eagle (not OSS), KiCad, openscad, freecad, librecad, qcad, and a few others. Blender works fantastically and has a very active community. Blender in general is a remarkable open source project. KiCad has a pretty similar feature set to Eagle, though last I was making some circuitry Eagle still felt more streamlined. Both Blender and KiCad seem to have excellent communities helping to push the projects forward.

OpenSCAD/FreeCAD/LibreCAD/etc just didn't work well enough that they were worth investing my time into. Limited feature sets, buggy, limited documentation, poor UX, etc. I was much better off breaking out pencil+paper+etc drafting tools. Those applications may have improved since, but I haven't checked up on them in a while. More or less for my woodworking projects it made much more sense to use blender to gain a rough idea of the look of the piece/assembly of the piece and draft out the rest of the information by hand.

* Krita: drawing app

I'm no artist, but I've used all three as well as their proprietary, Adobe counterparts. All three are powerful, but they each have quite a big learning curve, but Krita was the easiest to get up and running with.

Since artist apps are so complex, artists are unlikely to learn both programs to fully compare them. However, I've heard of several artists who swear by Krita, but I can't say the same for GIMP or Inkscape. That's not to say that they're not completely capable programs, just that, due to their complexity, I don't know of any serious artists who've taken it on themselves to learn them in addition to programs that already know.

So, in short, they're all pretty capable, but they require quite a bit of time investment to use properly, and learning resources may not be as plentiful as their proprietary counterparts.

> After spending some quality time comparing the actual experience of using Chrome, Safari, and Firefox across a variety of websites, I&#039;m confident in saying browser benchmarks are profoundly uninformative.

> Ever since its Quantum engine overhaul, Firefox has been garnering plenty of praise from satisfied users, and though I&#039;m only just starting to get into using it full-time as my main browser, everything I&#039;ve seen has been encouraging.

> If you&#039;re like me and want to strip your browser down to a bare address bar and a couple of arrows, you can do that as easily with Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, or any of the other alternatives like Edge and Vivaldi.

LTSP uses nfs. It's easier to also use nfs for your fileservices than to learn also samba. Samba is better for compatibility with windows though.

Have a look at cups for printing. It's the default print service.

For mail: postfix for smtp. And some imap server.

Things you didn't mention:

* monitoring: service health, server availability, disk space
* log server: where all hosts send their logging and where you can monitor for bad things

I recommend you use configuration management: if you only allow configuration to happen through ansible (or some alternative), you can develop and test configuration before doing it in production. Seems a bit much maybe, but it will save you time immediately: develop your ansible playbook to install and configure postfix or apache with a vagrant box on your workstation and when it is done you run the playbook on the production server. A playbook is a recording of what you did to make a service run.

If it's the latter, it sound like you're asking other people to do your literature review for you. If that's the case I'd recommend using google scholar to search for a recent heavily cited survey paper on the subfield. There are going to be plenty of algorithms with different tradeoffs which your usage will determine.

If you're looking for open source implementations, you're going to want to be more specific about what algorithms you're interested in. Then it should be much easier to search github/google/sourceforge or matlab/julia/R/python package repositories.",1523539668.0

* Understanding other people's work is hard. It's easier to start your own with full context of a very specific problem you want to solve.

* The idea of startups getting rich and thriving is strong. Some people don't want to share their code or their ideas, and if they do work on something, they want it to be their own. Programming is a high value activity, doing it for free may seem foreign to some.

zfundamental,"There are a number of ways to structure things and a number of roles that people can fall into. For many small->mid-large projects the roles generally fall into: maintainer, developer, contributor, and user. 

A maintainer is someone who has been with the project for a long period of time and generally helps guide the direction of the project as a whole. They likely know how to develop and they have the most technical and political privileges in the project.

A developer is someone who typically has direct access to the source code and can be trusted to make modifications without needing to consult others, however they're provided structure by the maintainer and are likely not involved in larger moves for the project (e.g. deciding on when releases happen).

A contributor is someone who makes changes to the code, but they require additional review by maintainers/developers. While contributors make changes to the project itself, they don't have much political influence.

A user does not contribute back in terms of changes to the project, but they help steer the goals of a project by reporting bugs and suggesting features.

> do the ""top contributors"" start getting a say about what should be added/changed?

If they're developers, yes. If they're just contributors, no.

> Or it is still completely up to the lead?

The lead helps shape the direction of the project, but depending upon their time commitment that may mean that developers have significant political influence.

> Can a top contributor be granted rights to commit code to the master branch? 

Yes. Contributors can upgrade to developers after some vetting process is complete.

> If so, what happens if the original lead doesn't like what the top contributor committed?

You talk about it. Worst case there's an unsolvable argument and the developer is demoted or the project forks.

> are there sometimes meetings about what the next set of tasks should be?

Yep. The details depend upon the individual project.

> How often do these meetings happen?

That varies wildly based upon the speed of development (number of maintainers+devs+contributors times the amount of free time)

> Any form of standard here, regarding roadmaps/goals going forward?

There's anything from a text file saying goals, to issue trackers, to full documentation manuals of future plans. So, it varies project-to-project.

* Thinkpad X230 i5 - tiny, extremely light and fast laptop. lowest price I've seen is $100 on Craigslist. battery is bad unless you shell out $40 for an extended battery, which doesn't add much weight or thickness.

Developers can release their code under GPL, then sell code under a different license when someone asks.

The one downside is that you have to decide how to handle any contributors during development. You'll need to one of:

- Get them to assign copyright to you. You can now do anything.
- Get them to agree to the licenses that you want (i.e. GPL + BSD or whatever.) See also ""CLA"" (Contributor License Agreements)
- Accept their patches and go GPL-only from now on

You can interact directly with the browser DOM from server-side code, and do things like bind DOM elements to values in your back-end database, such that if they change the browser's DOM updates automatically.

[Here](https://github.com/kwebio/core/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/io/kweb/demos/todo/todoApp.kt) is an example of what a simple to-do list app looks like.  Note that multiple users can view the same to-do list at the same time, and updates will be reflected immediately in their browsers.  You'll see that you get this behavior mostly for free.  The same mechanism handles routing, by treating the URL as just another type of mutable state.

Another interesting one on social behaviour is Dan Ariely's Predictably Irrational.

Computing is a research field, a science in its own right, and much like scientists, we make publications, share works, build off of the works of those before us. With open source we have options in computing that proprietary software developers do not have. In open source the only way for a project to die is nobody using or maintaining the code. In the proprietary world this would be it. The eol. Done. Code dies with the devs. But in open source I could easily fork Free Gem today and Revive a long dead program because the source code is still free and readily available.

ahuReddit,"So let me chime in with a non-money idea. I'm an open source developer myself (PowerDNS). Companies that are unable to send money or code can still do number of useful things for us:

1) Test early releases. Do not treat us like one of your commercial vendors and ask for long term support of old stuff. Instead, be the first to test release candidates and let us know how they work for you. Even if you can't deploy such new versions yet.

2) If our product disappoints, open a quality ticket full of detail that will help us solve your problem. Be responsive and willing to test packages or versions with the fix in them. 

3) Are you an interesting place that is potentially impressive? Consider sending a testimonial! Even if you are, say, a concrete factory, it is quite impressive if you can get your CIO to endorse something like ""Over at Super Duper Concrete factory, reliability is our prime concern. Thanks to SQL Sorter Pro we know our concrete mixers are serviced on schedule!"". This makes a massive difference for a project that might otherwise be ""very famous among people that already only run open source"".

4) If you open a ticket, please please please do not open it as 'SpamSpamAsd@gmail.com', as someone recently did to us. Open it as john@superduperconcrete.com. Again, this adds to the credibility of a project.

5) Like all software developers, open source developers may be somewhat removed from actual use cases. If you think the software could be better, engage with the community to explain what you are trying to achieve and how the software could help. Act as a part of the team and you'll be amazed at how happy we are with your input

6) If you have some time, and your boss does not need to know, go through open tickets on an issue tracker. If one is old and you think it may have been fixed already, see if you can verify that. Then update the ticket with ""I think this was addressed, it works fine in version 3.2.2"".

7) Did anything interesting with the software? Blog it up! Or share what you did with the mailing list, the slack channel or whatever. If you can't get away with naming your company, launder your coolness until you can share it anonymously. Do tell the developers privately who you are, it gives them warm feelings.

8) By all f*cking means, do not treat us like a commercial vendor or your personal help desk. Every week we get email like ""Team, PowerDNS is sending us errors when we create a new zone, this is disrupting our operations so we need your help soonest"". For extra points, mention that another closed source product never had this problem. If you remember one thing from this post, make it this item.

9) And finally - even if you can't do anything else, just sending a thank you already does wonders. Most open source product barely know about a few percent of their deployments. Simply hearing someone is happy with your work is great!

Yes, we need to be realistic and preserve what we have until money is dead, but killing money should be the focus, and I see that no one who cares about these issues seems to understand that money is the root of all problems, including this one. It cannot be fixed unless money is dead. Nothing can. Literally nothing. Money is the literal root cause for any other cause of any other issue in this world. There is literally not even one simple problem on this planet that is not caused by us accepting and using money as a humane or normal thing (it is neither).

That said; You can't fight them. You use their money, you belong to them. Until we repent (repent means disavow money and those who use it), we will live in sin (which is money, and nothing else, because money is the cause of all sin, so money itself is the sin)

Swelfie,"As someone who set up a fortune 50 GitHub account, I can answer his ""multiple licenses"" question.

Some companies are more licensing savvy than others, so yes, sometimes the license is just pulled out of a hat. There is that. But when you get to the fortune 50 level, there tends to be an expert in the chain somewhere and the license choice is deliberate.

Normally there will be an underlying preferred license that development, legal, open source experts and any community engagement determines best fits the company strategy. That's the license you go with if you have no good reason not to. Popular choices for this are Apache, BSD, MIT or EPL. 

Then there are constraints based on third party code. Let's say we normally release under Apache, but there's a hunk of GPL code in here. We obviously can't release under Apache and there may be no good reason NOT to release under GPL, so why do the dev work to get rid of the GPL. We just release our project GPL and call it a day. It may seem inconsistent from the outside, but there's a good reason. There might be other limitations, like there may be a patent in there that we just don't have the licensing rights to release under some licenses.

Then there is target market. Let's say we normally use the MPL2. We are writing a Drupal plugin. Is there anything wrong with an MPL2 Drupal plugin? Not really. But most everything in the Drupal universe is licensed GPL2. If we go and throw MPL2 in the licensing stack, well then our component is the oddball that's complicating the licensing for no good reason. Better to release under the traditional license for the community that this component is going to Target then try to stick to our guns and be consistent in our licensing. It just makes everything simpler.

Lastly is tactical. Let's say this thing I'm releasing is actually a competitive advantage and the ability for our competitors to take it from us, then take it proprietary and improve upon it might give them a leg up. This is actually much rarer than most people think. Most software is not the secret sauce that is innovative and makes the whole business work. Most software is frameworks and workflows that isn't innovative at all; it just needs to be built and is a straightforward result of expending human labor to build it. But occasionally there is secret sauce. In these cases we might choose to release as GPL or even AGPL to ensure that our contribution to the community is not taken proprietary and improved, leaving the community without the big benefit of collaboration and bolstering our own competition.",1522016405.0

tdammers,"A few important points though.

1. ""Free"" in this context usually means ""as in speech"". Free software is free in the sense that you can freely use, inspect, modify, and redistribute it. Not in the sense that money cannot ever be spent on it, or that people cannot get paid for developing and managing it.
2. This is donation money, not money being extorted from users by denying them the right to use the software, and then demanding payments for partially removing those restrictions. If you don't want to pay, don't donate. And the code that you ""donate"", as a contributor, remains free software - it can be sold, but that's not usually a fruitful endeavor. Nobody is making money off of your donations here.
3. Lawyers and managers like these people are in high demand, and they will not generally work for free. Part of the FSF's operation is channeling donation money into these efforts, and that is, in principle, a good thing.
4. The salaries mentioned here are big, but compared to what people in similar positions and with similar responsibilities make in the proprietary software world, they are not outrageous at all, in fact, it takes a bit of idealism to take a job like this over a comparable one at a big corporation. Especially if you consider secondary benefits, company shares and other privileges that an organization like the FSF cannot provide.
5. ""Non-profit"" does not mean ""cannot pay people for their work"" or ""cannot spend money"". It just means that any profit the organization makes cannot be withdrawn by any of its members - it must stay in the organisation, or be spent on things that match the organisation's declared goals. It means that there are no shareholders, owners, or similar, who directly and proportionally benefit from excess profit that isn't invested back into the company.

So then we have a much better world, as everyone can access every site on every device, good for the consumer.  (the demise of Flash is also helping a lot with this, perhaps because of similar pressure..)

Mobile apps are stuck with the big companies trying to monopolise the space and not using open standards, locking consumers in, making it bad for us.  Maybe mobile is harder to open up because the same big companies are making the hardware, there's not much open hardware to build software on.

Can you run a local mirror of all the downloads you need?",1521657649.0
metapwnage,"A repository or more than one. In typical OSS environments (read Linux), there are two major ways to manage updates to software. Operating systems address this with packages (operating system packages - software) and package-management software (yum, apt-get, apk, pkg, etc). Operating systems have repositories hosted by the OS creators and mirrored by others. Then to update all your OS packages you would run something to update the local cache (basically the listing of packages) and then run the upgrade. You can also add outside repositories to the sources.list, but this can be OS breaking (sometimes).

On a package-level however, you could just get specific software using tools like git, subversion, or mercurial. These repositories are hosted by sites like github, gitlab, svn, etc. same thing for python (pip repos). These can all pull latest updates for software.

So one option you (or the people responsible for “getting” OSS) can do is create appropriate repositories hosted locally (within the company network) to manage the state of available OSS within the company. Problem with this, is that there is no Windows update so to speak for these OSS packages, and your repository servers would not be able to push or force updates out. So then you have to somehow manage ensuring that each client is requesting updates for the OSS from the appropriate repository(s). If it’s on Windows, I guess Active Directory would be your friend in this effort, but some powershell kungfu would also likely help assist with that. 

I hope this is relevant. If it’s really Open-Source, might help. If it’s just some free download and not actually open source.... that’s a different animal. However if the company doesn’t just let everybody compile their own packages (typically the workflow with git or svn), you guys can just make your own custom repos with compiled versions of the software.

Let's say, software that can be the front end of Reddit, Facebook, diaspora*, WhatsApp and Signal in one? It would definitely make it easier for people to make the step towards some different platform. 
I am the only stubborn one in my social network who doesn't have WhatsApp, just Signal, but for some group apps it would be nice to communicate with them without using WhatsApp itself. 
For this, it would be great to have an open source communication platform that could be integrated in WhatsApp or different kinds of software. Problem is, there is already some nice open source solutions, but the big corporations don't see the need of integrating this in their servers",1521638958.0

RosettesandCSS,"I agree with tdammers on this one.  You can have a great system and even build something with thought towards a wide demographic.  However, it will come down to whether people will want to use it.  Somethings that can discourage a migration is:

a) A hard to use website (Good example of this is Mastodon and Twitter, with Twitter being easy to use and Mastodon's federated system being confusing for many)
b) Breaking routine and sign up for a new service, falling into a place that you will have to get to know all over again.

Id say that Facebook has alot of pull with people.  Even those who dont use computers much found Facebook appealing.  Most of them are never going to be comfortable with anywhere else, regardless of  any negative things that happen from those that run that network (again, the recent happenings with Facebook and how no one is deleting facebook after all this... not at all surprising)

**************

I did try Diaspora a long time ago.  It was seen as an alternative after our then-current social network died off.  Sadly, it never took off and people just went to Facebook more than anything else. Like Mastodon, Diaspora works with the federation concept. I think that in itself is a very hard thing for some computer users to grasp. Im someone who explores things and really looks at things, so I see the federated system as a non-issue. However, one of the things people got used to with Facebook was ""instant gratification"".  Its sewn into American culture, for sure. Diaspora's system of how ""hubs"" link up would be the kind of thing many wouldnt want to bother with. ",1521663256.0

Haxonek,"I think the other issue is would this actually solve any of the problems that are occurring right now?

I assume you're mentioning this since there's been issues with fake news &c, but it'd be harder to prevent people from sharing fake news on diaspora, since they wouldn't have as advanced a team or as much control of the platform to do so. Additionally for the same reasons it'd likely be easier to get people to take quizes and harvest data, and in this case I'd assume it'd be harder to prove any legal wrong doing since there isn't a company with loads of money behind it waiting to get them (though I can't be certain about that last fact).

I'd love to be proven wrong but I don't think this is really going to solve anything, in which case there's no real reason to try to move everyone.",1521688735.0
The_Enemys,IMO Diaspora is a terrible solution. What's to stop a data collection company from joining the network and siphoning the unencrypted user data exactly the same way Facebook allows?

shareometry,"I definitely think it's time to lodge an alternative to Facebook. And I'm actually working as part of a team building out a free-speech and privacy-conscious alternative right now (we are about 70% complete). We'd like to open source the platform at some point. It has all the features people would expect and more. But the problem we ran into when the original idea came up to have an open source platform is the problem of the operator. Things like client-side encryption and federation can help make it impossible for the operator to get at some of the user's data and to censor speech. But it's still going to be possible, in general, for an operator of a platform to use your data...unless they are legally obligated not to mine it and sell it and not to censor and so on. 

Our solution was to create a product that is very appealing and commercially viable and simultaneously attach a rather unprecedented terms of service that legally binds us (without loopholes) to the protection of user privacy and free speech. 

If anyone has a way to overcome the problem of the operator in a community-run way, I'm definitely open to learning more about it and seeing if it would be feasible. ",1522183239.0

paanvaannd,"Looks pretty neat; I look forward to seeing v1.0!

I'm not sure if Mycroft does this yet, and I believe Alexa is getting/recently got this function, but I would recommend adding some sort of follow-up window after a command so that users don't have to keep saying ""Léon"" every time they want to invoke the assistant, especially after having just done so.

Perhaps, in some Settings menu, the user could configure how they would like to summon and/or dismiss Léon? For example, Léon could be summoned through saying his name with or without any salutation. The user can then choose to let Léon act like how most/all other voice assistants and simply stop listening immediately after the end of the first command. However, users could also choose to have Léon continue listening for X more seconds before Léon stops listening for input *or* until Léon is dismissed somehow (perhaps through thanking him or any number of other ways to end the conversation).

You mentioned that you will be releasing v1.0 relatively soon, so perhaps this could be something to consider for v2.0 or some version in-between?

Example:

> User: ""Léon!""
> 
> Léon: *bell*
> 
> User: ""Will it rain today?""
> 
> Léon: ""There is a 60% chance of rain today.""
> 
> User: ""What's the coldest temperature we'll see today?""
>
>(notice: no need to say ""Léon"" again this time)
>
> Léon: ""It looks like it won't get colder than 10˚C today.""
>
> User: ""How long will it take to get from here to work?""
>
> (Again, no need to get Léon's attention)
>
> Léon: ""There's not much traffic out there. I'd estimate around... 15 minutes.""
>
> User: ""Thanks!""
>
> Léon: ""My pleasure.""
>
> *As thanking Léon is one way to dismiss continuous listening, Léon will no longer parse user speech until he is summoned once more.*

This could also lay the groundwork for follow-up questions in context: ask Léon how long it will take to drive to location X and then follow up with ""Okay, get me directions."" without having to summon Léon again or specify what location Léon needs to find directions for. I know this is far more complicated than the listen-until-dismissed example I outlined above, but if you/contributors are able to implement that later, that listen-until-dismissed behavior would probably need to be implemented anyways at that time.

Best of luck on the project. Cheers :+)

I used to think GIMP sucked. After being fully switched over for the past four years, I now know this isn't the case. Your workflow will be different, and it will take some time and re-learning, but you will be able to do everything you could do with Adobe software and more.

I think a major issue is just the perception of this software. There's a smug attitude surrounding Photoshop, like, ""this is such a professional tool and I'm so professional."" No. It's a status symbol. These days I cringe when I see people using Adobe software, because I know how it feels to be so immersed in it and then to overcome it.

I wish more agencies used GIMP and Inkscape and then proudly showed off what they did with it. Krita has [a gallery of artwork](https://krita.org/en/features/gallery/) people have made, which makes a big difference. It shows off the capabilities of the program.

Unfriendly, I hadn't heard of Matrix when my company was considering options to replace Google chat. Our team tested Discord (which everyone liked), but our management decided to use Slack instead
 Riot looks far more professional than Discord (probably the reason they opted for Slack).

Unfortunately, at this point it'll be very difficult for us to switch to Matrix. A Matrix based system would need the following:

* professional hosting and paid support
* integration with our other tools (Google Drive and Jira mostly)
* some way to test it out for a team of 5-10 people (current Matrix <-> Slack bridge may work, but it'll be a pain)
* some tangible improvement over Slack from a business perspective (company cares little about decentralization and open source, they care about integration and security of our data)

I think that if I can find a really good Jira integration built on Matrix as well as a good hosting provider, I can convince my boss to try it out. However, it'll be a hard sell since it's the same boss that really drove switching to Slack from Google chat (the switch was driven by me, Slack was driven by him) at pretty significant personal cost and the CEO us just getting on board.

However I don't think that the conclusions after showing each example are substantiated. A CoC essentially is a set of moderation guidelines and while linked the process of applying them for *moderation* (not censorship) is separate. In the examples the application of CoC terms were ineffective and a dividing force.

There are extreme individuals on both side, on the project old guard and new individuals and managing both sides is difficult. Additionally it's difficult for a loose collective, like an open source project, to have a single consistent message that they provide. IMO these sorts of issues make it difficult for a CoC to be an effective tool at changing (or maintaining) the culture of a particular organization.

As per the particular terms of FreeBSD's CoC, they seem to be by and large plenty sane. The one which seems to be attacked the most is the virtual hugs rule, which strikes me as odd that it's seen as frivolous.

People's ""feelings"" don't really come into that, IMO. Now, of course there's no reason to be an asshole or go out of your way to bully or shame anybody, but we're all adults here are we not? Do we really require any more set-in-stone rules other than ""don't be an asshole"" ?

EDIT: Further, I have to think that this type of shit will drive people away who would otherwise contribute to the project(s) in a variety of different ways (code, docs, money, etc.) I have to imagine that some people get into coding and contributing to open source projects as a way to *get away* from all the political nonsense going on right now.

> It’s important to remember that the controversy surrounding Williams didn’t start because a member of the Node community was having trouble working with her and filed a complaint, but because an anonymous Reddit user dredged up her old tweets and laid them out against selected portions of the code of conduct. 

That seems relevant and perhaps misleading to leave that out. Can someone be racist on the weekend but keep that out of their work life? What if they were racist three years ago? That's not easy to answer.

I don't buy the control argument. He even admits having nothing to back that up with. Saying someone else is just in it for control makes them one dimensional. I think someone can have good overall intentions and still be a jerk or act inconsistently.

The original RIP Brian thing IMO is in very poor taste. It's worth noting the full text after his image cuts off is:

> 0 Au
> killed by a crippling lack of self-awareness
> 2018

It's in bad taste and insulting - but I can't read it as a death threat. Why not just call it offensive?

The culture wars he talks about can in fact divide people who are should otherwise want to be working together. That's a good point he makes IMO. However I find Lunduke's usage of selective information to be as much of the problem that he decries. If Lunduke wants the community to come together - I suggest he take to the strong man style of arguing and assume the best in people he disagrees with.

He points out how [a guy from the nodejs foundation](https://youtu.be/s087Ca9JnYw?t=898) almost got banned for sharing an article on his twitter account that promoted hate speech as a way to not hold back technological progress, but **he fails to mention the guy's [long history](https://web.archive.org/web/20170821212745/https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/310) of trying to undermine the nodejs code of conduct** that culminated with inflammatory rhetorics meant to further aggravate the issue instead of moderating it as was his job.

The guy in the video is cherry picking his arguments in order to victimize people that have been removed from online communities without mentioning the context in which these things happened. That's dishonest and the aim is to make hate speech and harassment be accepted as part of technological forum discussions.

How about we don't harass other people when they disagree with us? How about we focus on the code and not let our emotions interfere? That's when division happens and people begin to take sides instead on focusing on improving the code they are working on.

**That's the purpose of having a code of conduct, to keep the discussions on topic and to avoid conflicts.**

Regarding the ""hipocrisy"" of the people that promote CoCs, a CoC violation [report](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/324) has been filed for Ashley Williams, one of the nodejs leaders. **The guy in the video doesn't mention this.**

Below from that report.

> However, we must also be aware that there are individuals in the community who feel that harassment of any form against {Insert Particular Group Name Here} is fully justified because {Insert Particular Group Name Here} somehow ""deserves"" it. Playing along with such harassment !== Code of Conduct enforcement. We cannot let ourselves be sucked into that kind of game playing. We do have an obligation to take every report seriously unless it can be shown that the report is nothing more than a form of harassment. Even then, we still have an obligation to consider the report.

> Unfortunately, this can end up being quite a subjective decision to make, so we need to look at more objective measures. In this particular case, the individual in question (a Foundation Board member and a CommComm member) is not a contributor to core. The TSC can choose to limit the individuals ability to participate in TSC-managed repositories by removing their write access to those but that is the extent of the action the TSC can take. We cannot ban the individual from all participation because the TSC does not have oversight over either the Board or the CommComm, and their participation in both grants the individual a certain level of access. That is a purely objective measure.

> I will say that this report is being looked at by both the CommComm and the Foundation Board, independently of the TSC, and it is being taken seriously. Aside from any targeted harassment campaign that may be occurring, this is not the first time we have received feedback from people in the community expressing concerns about the individual in question, I just believe that given the lack of active participation on the technical side of things, the TSC is not the correct venue for handling this particular case.

> My plan at this point is to at least raise this issue for consideration by the TSC/CTC during the private section of the upcoming meeting, with my personal recommendation that the issue should be deferred to the other committees.

Original_Chalice,"There are a few. All ARM. The IBM Power9 infrastructure has fully auditable firmware, but aside from Talos, I don't know of any other projects attempting to make a desktop from them. We have to put pressure on manufacturers, utilize older technologies to our modern needs, whether that means modifying old components, going full FOSS ARM, or simply sticking to older hardware. We don't have enough of the home computer share to do this right now, so getting excitement and buzz about FOSS is what we have to do. Donate time and money to FOSS projects we believe in, and then spread the word even with advertising.


And by the way, wasn't that the whole thing about the AMD and Intel Management Engines? The whole system is completely auditable without the performance degrading patch. 


I have one device i connect to the internet, the rest are used to experiment. But these past few weeks have left me with desire to try something new. I believe I'm going to jump on the SBC ARM bandwagon and do some experimenting to make one my primary machine. If all goes well i will donate to the cause or a similar one.

UnderTruth,"Been doing some independent work on this.

For hardware, there are some projects like the [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/) phone, and a couple laptops, which are due out next year.

Currently, open-source (and ideally libre) hardware options are: (for x86 or ARM) [Libreboot X200](https://minifree.org/product/libreboot-x200/), Taurinus X200, [Novena](https://www.kosagi.com/w/index.php?title=Novena_Main_Page), possibly BeagleBoard or BeagleBone Black or PandaBoard, then Lemote Yeeloong 8089D or 8101B (uses MIPS instruction set - “Stallman approved”), [OLinuXino](https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/open-source-hardware) [ category/manufacturer, not a single thing ], or [HiFive](https://www.sifive.com/products/hifive1/) (uses RISC-V, and still in progress). But I am not personally familiar with using any of these, and you can see that there's a variety of instruction sets here, so not all are compatible with:

Open source firmware, which seems to be most exemplified in [Libreboot](https://libreboot.org/).

Now, my own personal interest and goal is to do three things, primarily:

1. Design a full PCB (Motherboard + CPU) which is comprised of very small units for each kind of larger chip, so that each small portion is tessellated to comprise the larger chip. Since the whole is composed of these smaller, identical pieces, what it amounts to is something like an FPGA, but without the need to ""set"" in different ways. This way the hardware itself can be verified to function only as described, and [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_Trojan) or even [dopant](https://sharps.org/wp-content/uploads/BECKER-CHES.pdf) trojans can be prevented. Verifiable circuitry like this would be the King Midas' glove that would make all the rest of the process easy by comparison.

1. Bring about 3-D printing of that functional PCB in your own home (or at least school) with something remotely close to what modern manufacturing provides in terms of performance. This may or may not be possible, given the dangerous nature of those modern manufacturing techniques needed to obtain the performance we have - it might be impossible to do this in a ""average person"" user-friendly manner, simply because of chemical or heat requirements. But if at all possible, this must be done to ensure one can produce the above spec without modification by manufacturer.

3. Provide the verification tests within all of the above spec so that the circuits, the firmware, and the hardware components can be tested (and in the case of the hardware, the components can be toggled physically to disable or enable network, camera, and microphone access, for example).

I am woefully inadequate to this task, but am slowly building up my knowledge and connections to work on this, or at least help spur others on to these tasks. All three are being worked on, in some capacity, (see [Voltera](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voltera/voltera-your-circuit-board-prototyping-machine) 3D printing, for example) but not as a unified effort.",1519879554.0

the_angry_angel,"Distributions, such as Debian (Stable), backport security fixes for key packages rather than update packages continuously. This is common practise for long term supported distributions. The version string isn’t necessarily an indication of vulnerability. 

I would expect the host to be based on one of these distributions.

I’d be surprised if your host is backporting all patches themselves, if any. It depends on the size of the company though. 

If they were backporting patches themselves, in terms of the licensing it depends. AGPL they’d be obliged to make backported patches available. For GPL since they’re not distributing the software, technically no. Other licenses it depends on the clauses attached.",1519679476.0

Usually the security releases of major software will run for a few years after the last update feature release to give people time to update but still maintaining security related issues. Like /u/the_angry_angel noted, if they are backporting security issues themselves, that is a whole other issue (and more unlikely).

It's not like open source.

What's free to download on the Internet Archive are audience recordings. People were allowed to record their concerts starting around 1984. The sound isn't great on these - a lot of ambient noise - but it was a cool thing for the band to allow their fans to do.

If you want legal access to uncompressed soundboard recordings you have to buy them from the band, and they decide what and when they make available for purchase. Currently they release about 5-6 shows every year through the Dave's Picks series and an occasional box set.

I then moved on to a bit more sophisticated contributions. The whole country was lacking district boundaries, so I found a reliable source and then converted the data into OSM format with a script. But when I realized that I could modify country-wide OSM data without any checks, I knew that this project was not going to be a dependable source of map data in the future and my interest quickly waned. I would have *loved* it if my contributions were reviewed and approved by someone more experienced.

It would help OSM to have a ""pull-request"" model for contributions. However, pull-requests based on textual diff may not suite OSM.

The gravity of this point cannot be overstated.  Has there ever been anything close to someone abstaining from a decision because it will erode their commercial enterprise?  I doubt it.  This is where inexperience comes back to plague a project.  Failure to recognize situations where conflicts of interest are undeniable and failure to do anything about it will, indeed, keep the project crippled.   Moreover, it will hurt funding when someone within a professionally run charitable organization does take a fine tooth comb and analyzes the project for a potential grant/donation to make sure the monies go towards a public benefit rather than enhancing someone's private opportunity.",1518832480.0

Remy-,"He brings up many interesting points. I'm currently doing research on OSM and one of the problems I keep uncovering is that there are a lot of by-products using OSM data, but these are so fragmented, and not updated that they're just becoming e-dust. OSM could really benefit from expanding theirself into a platform instead of a single service.

A few other notes:
> ""They just want a map. OSM has a map on its website but discourages its use by third parties. Instead, users are expected to either find a commercial service to render the map for them or else do it themselves.""
I feel like Mapbox is now the popular solution for this, and therefore all the applications that pay Mapbox for their service are now profiting from OSM data indirectly. But I'm not sure what Mapbox's relationship is with OSM.

> ""No moderation/review model
One of the most significant technical problems with OSM is the lack of a review model, that is for a change to the map to be staged and then reviewed before being applied. Not having this functionality caused ripples of problems throughout the system, some of which I'll discuss here.""
Speaking of Mapbox [OSMCha](https://osmcha.mapbox.com) is an application built to monitor and review changes. From my understanding, it asks users to manually review validation and errors and feeds that information into a machine learning model to detect vandalism/errors. This seems like a productive model to invest in.

> ""OSM's Lack of Layers
Most geographic databases use a layered approach to represent different features. One layer may represent political boundaries; another may represent the road network, a third may represent water features, and so on.""
Layers would be so awesome. Or even the X-ray feature like in the early days of Mapbox.

> ""No Support For Observational, or Other Datasets
One of the core tenants of OpenStreetMap is that it only stores persistent, personally verifiable data. The only exceptions to this are political boundaries- and even these exceptions can be problematic. Unfortunately, this also presents a problem with third parties want to use OSM for things outside of the project scope.""
This would also be amazing, but tricky to implement because it seems like the datasets should be highly localized. It's basically asking for the ability to create shapefiles and feature classes (again on Mapbox/Arc), but also require the ability to share them freely (available in ArcGIS Online but that place is a /mess/). Some other similar 'free marketplace' could be useful.

> ""Lack of Permanent IDs
In any database, objects have an ID field, usually a numeric value to look the record up by. OSM is no different and every object inside OSM has an ID field. Unfortunately, in OSM the ID fields represent the low-level objects rather than any high-level concept. This creates a huge problem""

> Something not mentioned in the article is that there are great contentions about how and what things get to be mapped, and how biases in the board can oppression perspectives that conflict with their own. Case in point: Monica Stevens observed how the politics surrounding officialization of tags favored differentiating 'masculine' placed over 'feminine' places: [Guns, Germans, and Strip Clubs](http://www.floatingsheep.org/2012/07/sheepcamp-2012-monica-stephens-on.html?m=1). Which goes back to the issue of geocoding - if there are different semantics used for different childcare venues in real life, but gatekeepers prevent this from being translated into OSM, who really suffers from that?

3316556,"This post seems half right, half wrong.

Wrong that OSM should be a service provider and not a database - I think it should be a database, and corporations are good for OSM. The post calls for OSM to essentially become Mapbox. It's insanely expensive to be Mapbox, and Mapzen just failed trying to be a less corporate version of Mapbox. And then the usage policy part of the article is moot or at least not that consequential if you don't believe OSM should be a service provider.

Right: Moderation tools need to be created/fixed. New mappers need to be encouraged/onboarded better. Vandalism is a problem. OSMF culture is toxic. Hidden gatekeepers are toxic. Imports need to be supported. Bots need to be enabled, and we need to consider people who contribute code/tech/imports first class OSM contributors and not just glorify the individual mapper.

Probably right: OSM needs layers, or even a more sweeping re-architecture to allow better versioning, moderation, better tooling, and easier understanding of the data.

Probably wrong: Expanding the scope of OpenStreetMap to include transient data. Too much other work to do, maybe later for this.",1518886672.0

,"TIP: if you want a free distro, only buy hardware which doesn't require proprietary drivers and, possibly, binary firmware too.  Then take any distro (oustide propretary like RHEL, SuSE Enrterprise and commercial-company financed, AKA Ubuntu) and don't enable nonfree repos. Never add non-free extensions (Chronium-widevine) and particularly remember to avoid at all costs, Steam, Spotify, Drive, Dropbox, WMware, Mathlab, PowerDVD, Corel Draw, Java, Flashplayer, AutoCAD, Adobe Reader, Kingsoft Office, Google Chrome, Telegram, Discord, Netflix, etc..
Then use FOSS programs as much as you can, show your friends and relatives how do they fare well as alternatives and what's the sense of FSF phylosophy. Be sure to catch new FOSS initiatives as soon as they're submitted on github, thus to be able to  test them and contribute committing issues and pull requests, or even forking a repo and improve a project if you have the competence required.

Speaking of free distros I recommend [**Dragora GNU/Linux Libre**](https://www.dragora.org/repo.fsl/doc/trunk/www/index.md) an awesome independent project, or if you want to dig into the FSF completely,there's [**GuixSD**](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/), which is practically the FSF software  frontend and testing platform,uses the native GNU/Shepherd Init, and plans for the future (how distant??? ahahah) include releasing a Hurd based version. I've never tested it though. Popular Free Linux distros are also [**Trisquel**](https://trisquel.info) (Ubuntu-based), [**Parabola GNU/Linux Libre**](https://www.parabola.nu) (Arch-based), [**gNewSense**](http://www.gnewsense.org) (Debian-based), more niche ones instead are [**blag**](http://www.blagblagblag.org) (Fedora-based) and [**Ututo**](http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&nv=1&rurl=translate.google.es&sl=es&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=http://www.ututo.org/&usg=ALkJrhji3h3Fp9GtwU6jPnCqk4eZjoljdw) (Gentoo-based).

If you want to try something outside Linux (don't limit yourself!) OpenBSD and [**DragonflyBSD**](https://www.dragonflybsd.org) are almost free (outside closed-source firmware...but so many wireless NICs and dedicated sound cards require it!), though a pure free (OpenBSD-based) BSD is available, under the name of [**LibertyBSD**](https://libertybsd.net).

[**Tribblix**](http://www.tribblix.org) is a free Illumos derivative, I use it on a older desktop

[**Pure Darwin**](http://www.puredarwin.org) is the official FOSS, currently in Alpha Stage, Darwin fork. You can download and install a qcows2 image on QEMU, and provide useful feedback (don't expect too much); Macports can be built upon it. 

Speaking of macOS,if you use it,despite being a proprietary OS, you could rely only on FOSS software, making use of the various alternatives available:

- [**macports**](https://www.macports.org)

- [**pkgsrc**](https://www.pkgsrc.org)

- [**HomeBrew**](https://brew.sh)

jpodster,"There are different kinds of intellectual property and you seem to be conflating them. 

Generally and very broadly, these are copyright, patents, & trademarks.

Copyright is for a specific work. This could be the text of a book, the words & melody of a song, a recording of a song, or a film. It could also apply to the source code or binary for software.

Patents are for specific novel ideas. This could be for a new process, procedure, or mode of operation. This could include the idea of an internal combustion engine, chemical formula for an adhesive, or new door locking mechanism. It could also apply to the series of steps or algorithm used behind a piece of software. The idea must not be obvious to a person trained in the field and the definition of novelty can vary greatly by jurisdiction.

Trademarks are for specific words or sometimes phrases used to identify a unique product or brand. It could be a company name like Microsoft or a product time like Office or Excel.

Software is a unique product that can fall under all three types of IP.

To avoid trademarks, don't use the same or similar name of the software you are cloning.

To avoid copyright, don't use the source code (unless you are complying with an open source licence) for the software you are cloning. This is less of an issue in the closed source world as you don't have the code generally.

Patents can be harder to avoid. Especially in software as there are a lot of examples of patents that have been granted that some would argue are not novel. They can be stumbled upon when trying to decode an audio file which was compressed using a patented process. This can happen even without the source for the original compression. In general though, broad ideas can't be patented and the patents must be specific so broad software concepts can not be enforceable patented. 

Software patents also do not apply in all jurisdictions but all intellectual property laws vary by jurisdiction.

Open source and intellectual property are fascinating topic but I would suggest you find some good resources as it is very complex.",1518478452.0

If someone else is taking credit for work that they have not done, then that's pretty insulting IMO. In fact if my interpretation of the MIT license is correct (I am nowhere near a lawyer), it sounds like they have broken the terms of the license. The MIT license provides a means to sublicense, but not relicense the source in question according to my understanding ( https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license ). If they have in fact broken the terms of the license I would make some effort to get them to correct that mistake.

Additionally substantial forks take resources away from one project and then spread them out between the two projects. Notably this can introduce headaches in terms of being able to attract new contributor. Additionally it has the possibility of confusing users looking to use one of the projects. 

Long term forks are one of the major possible features of open source, but they can also be a major headache if there is interest in both versions.

> Can anyone provide some advise on dealing with a situation such as this in a careful manner?

I would do some research to see if they have in fact broken the license of the original project.

Building and safety codes are an enormous and glaring abuse of copyright laws to keep information out of the hands of the public. How are you supposed to follow the law if you're not even allowed to see it without paying an exorbitant fee? 

I had no idea how big of a problem the proprietary nature of government documentation was until I was discussing voter registration databases with some other redditors a few years ago and we were talking about setting up a voter database where people could voluntarily take part in exit polls. The first step seemed to be to get a copy of the voter databases. Surely this was publicly available information, right? 

Not even close. In fact, voter registration information is tightly controlled and is a highly lucrative market with major price tags that keep grassroots efforts from having access to the political process. Many assume that government publications can't be copyrighted but while that is true and in some notable cases this creates great treasuries of open data like the NASA archives there are many tricks which are used to keep what seems ought to be publicly available information out of the hands of the public. 

Maps are another huge issue. Often the data in map sets such as parcel maps are actually collected by taxpayer funded government operations and is technically available to the public. . . but in order to view them you need a proprietary viewer that you can't even buy but only license for use from a private corporation at rates that are completely outrageous.

* It eases your pain caused by the scaling / availability issues. It is terrible if your service is down AND heavy traffic from stuck users stops your status page.
* It enables you to pay only for what you use. A status page only occasionally gets huge traffic. The system takes only $1 per 30,000 visitors and almost $0 if no visitors.

Here are the the demo pages:

* [Status page](https://demo-status.lambstatus.org/): the page to tell your service's status to your users
* [Admin page](https://demo-admin.lambstatus.org/): the page to manage your service's status

> My rant on Open Source and how to get started with it

Interesting tagline as 'rant' is going to imply a lot of energetic complaints to the community 'in-the-know', and the other part indicates that you're trying to address the group of people who don't have any experience with open source. Generally you want to address a single audience, but that's not always the case.

> Also this article is illogically filled with emojis and gifs. 

I strongly recommend to anyone reading this to open their browsers dev tools and add a CSS rule to eliminate this visual spam. The excessive amount of gifs implies that the audience (i.e. the readers) cannot maintain enough attention to read a short article which is IMO a pretty bad thing to imply.

> Not a long time ago I was a CS and

The context implies the author meant to say CS student, so I'd recommend just saying that instead of it reading that you were previously in a computer science related field and are no longer.

> 1. Life can be Unclear. Give things their own time.

A bulleted list in the context of this article implies that each one has a take away for what to expect and how best to address the problems present in getting started with open source. This section has some points to make, but fails to explicitly state them. It focuses too much on what the author has done and too little on the translation of that experience to the audience.

> What I’m trying to say is 

If you have to re-explain yourself using this language, then why did you use the explanation prior to this sentence as you're acknowledging that it does not convey your point?

> both technical and non-technical

I disagree as to how the author presents technical and non-technical aspects. It reads like the author was looking for a different sort of categorization, but didn't find one. There is some sound advice in this section, but it needs to be recontextualized for beginners as well as broken into simple distinct questions the readers can understand and act upon.

> In situations like these first always state your intent that you’ve started working on the issue

The author is speaking in terms of beginner/first-contributor issues, which by and large are meant to be done in a small period of time. Unless someone needs clarification it seems unwise to post ""I'm doing this"" unless it's a longer form task. In that case it would make a lot more sense (IMHO) to recommend that people keep communications open and update regularly stuff that they're working on (e.g. ""hey I've upgraded 2/3 libraries at the moment, but the third one is giving me headaches. I'll likely revisit this on Tuesday and hopefully have a pull request done then"" rather than ""This issue is mine, no one else do it"").

> Follow your Gurus

Gurus, really?

>  Every successful Guru / Master was once at a stage where he/she learned the fundamentals either by following a book ( written by a guru ) or some friend or colleague.

The author implies that there's only one real path to learning a subject which simply is not the case. Such statements should be avoided when speaking to beginners.

> Also it’s not just enough to do the tasks assigned or picked up. Try to go out of your way to encourage and motivate others. This can be done by arranging local Meetups or by simple writing blogs about your experiences

I agree with the author completely here. A sense of community is a key aspect to this sort of work.

> Persistent is the key.

*Persistence


At the end there are a few tidbits here and there for beginners, but the context for that audience isn't great.

The rest of the video shows a listing of features and the barebones basics, but IMO fails at telling an effective story. I would recommend considering having the video be oriented around a simple goal to motivate __why__ each feature exists and __when__ the users would want to use it.

For example, let's say that you wanted to mix five seconds of guitar with five seconds of vocals. You could initially record them poorly, then adjust the gain, then fine tune the timing issues, and then showcase one effect which makes everything sound better. This provides the same feature description and it motivates each operation in a way that a user can relate to.

As it stands this video does a good job at being a feature/functionality showcase, though I don't know if that was the intended result.

> Re: How to Help Open Source Succeed

Your proposal is to pay a similar amount to a commercial project, which is a start. To get a software project complete there needs to be a large infusion of skilled labor (i.e. time) or a boatload of cash. As cash doesn't tend to appear by the boatload from crowds when it comes to tools which are available at $0 cost with free licenses, then I'd say it's much more realistic to dedicate some time. That can be time invested in bug hunting, in documentation writing, in design work, helping manage project questions, or the one most people think of, code. Just because you cannot program does not mean you cannot help.

> you should not give money to poorly built open source software

If people refuse to give time/money to 'poorly built' software then no software would end up getting off the ground. Most projects software/hardware/art/etc start off being pretty darn terrible.

At least for Enterprise solutions, the answer is support. Having someone you can pass the buck to if something in the software isn't working is something that companies value. Support subscriptions keep on paying when straight up buying a software/support package doesn't.

The way that open source companies do this is to release the code and let anyone download and build it, but past that you are on your own to RTFM. Find a bug? Either notify the developers and hope it gets fixed before your deadline or try to fix it yourself. With the paid versions, you report the bug and either have them fix it, or they find a work around.

Suddenly the entire world shifts, you are no longer a bitchy user crying for moar features, you are a helpful contributor who occasionally has some ideas to throw in the mix.

zfundamental,"> Anyways, I'm starting to understand why so many open source projects never take off. This hostile attitude towards newbies along with poor UX (a known problem with most open source projects), as well as poor documentation for new users can't be helping much.

I'm not so much on the hostility for newbies argument, but I wholely agree with the poor UX and poor documentation issues. As an open source maintainer ( https://zynaddsubfx.sf.net ) and someone who has recently put a lot of time and effort into trying to improve said applications ( http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/roadmap.html see 2.4.x vs 3.0.x) usability the reason why the UX and documentation issues exist is:

- It's plain hard to do - Working on usability and design issues can be a very foreign task for many individuals in open source
- It takes a massive amount of time to do - In the past few (~2) years I've easily put 800-900 hours into the application and the interface is nowhere as polished or clean as I would like. There's tons of minor usability changes to be made, tons of visualization work left to be done, plenty of minor bugs, and as all of that piles up there are a ton of feature requests which come in at a steady pace
- On a per-hour basis it doesn't feel as rewarding - For fixing a bug ""hurray you have a happy user"", for adding a feature ""cool it's something new to play with"", for fixing a medium/small usability issue ""you've now made an old user angry who want's the old bad behavior and you'll never hear anything from the new users who it helps"", documentation work ""the author doesn't directly gain anything and likely doesn't get feedback""
- There's a critical mass for each one of these items - Documentation is pretty useless until it covers a significant portion of a tool otherwise the gaps are more annoying than what it does detail (however well). Usability is determined by the weakest link and fixing one issue likely doesn't change the overall usability by much or at all.


> I saw the creator many times respond with ""why don't you contribute to the project"" (meaning writing code) if you think a feature is missing"".

It's because they don't have the time to do the task or they don't have a good motivation to do the task. Many of the individuals who are skilled enough to perform solid contributions to complex systems (whether it's creating a documentation structure, making a slick new interface design, or build a complex algorithm) do it as a job and will have less motivation to do the same sort of thing for free unless there's some benefit for them in return. This doesn't have to be as direct as $, it could be just having fun and fun tends to be that individual working on what interests them, not what is requested (or occasionally demanded) by people they don't directly know.

Getting contributors for a project is *hard*. Getting long term contributors is *harder*. If they can convert someone from asking them to do work into a colleague who is helping out that is a *huge* gain for the project overall.

> all seem to be quite hostile towards newcomers who ""don't read the documentation""

This is frustratingly common as project maintainers can end up transforming into living documentation. They want people to be able to understand what they work with. They don't want to repel people, but they also want people to respect their time. If they think that there's work that they put into documentation and people are not reading it, then that will frustrate them and convince them that the documentation work was a waste of time. Honestly the best way to defuse this comes down to the questioner (unfortunately). 

If the questioner can say ""Hey, how do I do XYZ? I read the section on ABC in the manual and searched forum DEF for 'keywords', but I can't really make heads or tails of this"" then that's a major difference than ""X is broken because I can't do XYZ."" One side is working with the developers acknowledging that documentation isn't there and the other is being (understandably) aggravated and directing that at the people that are donating their time.

> There has to be a better way to help new users who don't get it

Project external documentation tended to be a major source in the past, though it has dwindled quite significantly in the past 10 years IMO. Before then it would be common to find a blog having the bare minimum ""getting started"" info which would help beginners, but those are now a rarer resource forcing the original project to both write, host, and direct people to those resources.

If you go and ask something like ""how to use this?"" and it's evident you either don't get what it's for or haven't even tried, I'd be very frustrated and tempted to ignore it or brush it off. Nobody wants to spend their free time playing customer tech support, people who maintain OS projects would not even spend their paid time doing that, mostly.

On the other hand if you join and start the conversation like ""here is what I'm trying to do and I've got this far, but this specific issue is blocking me"" I'd likely take a look and attempt to help because you are doing your part. If a bug is discovered then I'd eventually fix it as well (depending on priority and if it's really a bug), although as you suggested the first thing I'd do is ask if you wanted to attempt to fix it and open a PR.

The point is, open source projects are *free* and the maintainers do all of us a favour just by creating them. There's no argument at all that is valid against them. If someone were to be the worst human being, all you'd have to do is fork their project to avoid having to deal with them.

Also saying you can't code is not really an excuse when you complain about docs and UX. Contributions to improved documentation are usually just as welcome as those to code.

So many many open source projects.

If you need a boost of good people doing good things. Go to github. It is where these superdevs your are looking for exist.

If you want to find a place to help and you have decent video editing skills.
I suggest this.

Learn how to teach firstly. Understanding blooms taxonomy is a good start, find alternative patterns. Research how to diagram and build learning objectives.
Then. Start teaching open source software on YouTube.

You will absolutely make money if you market it by using the words alternative to <insert arbritrary proprietary software>

This will get more people learning and using FOSS. It is probably the biggest gap and hurdle yet to cross. The layman hates documentation and doesnt understand how to find software to meet thier needs. Teach people how to find and use the free good stuff to drive traffic to it.

Some good projects and ideologies?

Devops for one.
The principles driving it are focused on humanizing the lives of operations guys. making them not have to live like super heroes and or die from overwork.
OnyxPoint is a company that comes to mind (Used to work for them) 
They open sourced SIMP which is a compliant and secure badass tool to manage infrastructures. Go help them! lol

Canonical, Libre, the linux foundation, (teledoc!)

He'll, I'm gonna even throw in Red Hat.
There is plenty money floating around.

Go teach how to program.


If you are wondering where the badass cynics are? They dont exist as they do in Television. All of the highly functioning developers I have met and know are laser focussed on what they do. Often ignoring the nonsense that asshats release. They focuss on controlling and developing within thier means,  and try to ignore what they cannot control. Preaching takes time away from coding. And coding is the only way. :)

* what technologies would you like to learn? This would give you more long-term motivation. 

Now, as to the domain, this really is the most important question, because it helps you significantly narrow down your search. If it still sounds generic, try to think of an example in the real world. 

What kind of work would you do as a volunteer in the physical world? What organisation's work inspires you? 

Even if you don't get a job out of it, where will you feel that your time was well spent regardless, because you helped make a change in the world?

If you can discover this kind of motivation, the rest should become somewhat more straightforward. ;)

Ramin_HAL9001,"> To be honest I never really got why the whole game, or for that matter any application ever, had to be based on Qt and KDE to begin with. Qt is a very, very intrusive thing. It’s not just a library full of cool stuff, it’s a framework. It locks you into its concept of what an application is and how it is supposed to work, and what your code should look like and how it is supposed to be structured. You need a whole toolchain with a metacompiler because your code isn’t even standard C++.

This. This is exactly why I've never been thrilled about using KDE or Qt for anything, ever.

I guess now everyone is moving to a ""lets invent our own language"" approach to building GUI apps. KDE has QML, and Gnome has Vala, Android has a weird non-standard version of Java, Microsoft has C#, Apple has Objective-C and now Swift.

In the mean time, everyone got sick of all these different, incompatible development frameworks, and the web browser has become the platform of choice for just about all app front-ends. Web Assembly will hopefully, finally, be the end-all-be-all of front-end GUI platforms.",1515431471.0

If I were paranoid I would keep it connected via TOR all the time. I think one distro uses a VM inside the distro that the main distro connects to, and from there it connects to TOR, that way the main OS doesn't know what network it's even connected to. TAILS I think?

TrashMacNugget,"- MIT is the most popular. You can do almost _anything_ with MIT code as long as you keep the license intact in copies. ISC and the various BSD licenses work similarly.
- Apache 2.0 is like MIT, but it also includes a patent grant. If someone gives you license to use their software under the Apache license, they can't then sue you because it uses their patents.
- zlib is like MIT, but only requires the license notice be kept in source form. Binaries do not need to keep the license intact.
- GPL requires that if you distribute binaries, you give the source code as well (at least upon request). GPLv3 is the newest version which is recommended. Most projects let you use GPL or any later version (if it's GPLv2, you could use it under GPLv3, for example), but some projects don't (notably the Linux kernel). GPLv2-only and GPLv3 code are incompatible and can not be combined. Closed source software cannot include GPL code. See the [GPL FAQ][].

    GPLv3 has some differences with GPLv2: a patent grant, anti-tivoization clause (if you make a physical product with GPLv3 software in it, the user must be able to replace the software and install something else if you can), etc.

If somebody spent 3 weeks building some cool library and released it as open source, then ""don't act like a customer, just try to fix things yourself if you have a problem"" is probably the best way to interact with it.

On the other hand larger projects often do, quite intentionally, develop a customer service mindset. For instance, I have closely watched the team that releases the Python language over about a decade and they have consistently operated with a very strong ""customer service"" mindset. Of course they welcome people who supply patches along with their suggestions, but they also welcome feedback without code, and even if you provide a patch they will not accept it unless it meets the project's standards for format, test coverage, and code quality.

So I would say it is different for different open source projects.",1514925352.0

I've noticed this sentiment growing over the years amongst new comers in particular

Hackers, where this kind of ideas and philosophy were the norm, not the exception.

Richard Stallman's bio of the godfather of it all and why he did it. Besides, Steven Levy's book last chapter is titled ""The last true hacker"" and speaks about Stallman. Can you see the continuum here, right?

classicrando,"You would be doing yourself a disservice if you start with Linux and GNU - the basis of open source group dynamics, processes and government/industry/academia cooperation was set in motion in large part due to a 1951/56 consent decree giving AT&T a monopoly in phone services.

Standards bodies and ""open"" hardware played a big part in making open software viable and those things evolved in parallel with open software.

TrashMacNugget,"> I have a web application for my school and more then five thousand people actively using it. I'm using mysql for my application. Basically I'm running stored procedures on my application and when i share all of my codes, everyone will see how do i connect to database and which stored procedures i use. Of course they will only see name of procedures but it isn't a issue? Should i just release it?

It's not an issue, so long as you don't commit your passwords, API keys, etc.

> I thought I wouldn't commit it but then how people try to build app after some changes? This problem comes with should i share my database? All my query's like my tables etc.? Yeah newbie in open source and security..

Probably not, as this probably has personal user information in it. Make sure you make a README file that explains what to put in that file, and how to set up the server on your own.

> One more thing.. Which licence should i choose and people really care the licence?

You have a few choices. You can pick

- A permissive license. These let you do whatever you want with the code so long as you give the author credit.

    - [Apache License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) - much more robust
    - [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) - very short

- A copyleft license. These require that if you change the code and distribute it, you have to give it back. These ensure you get code back, but it is also more difficult to comply with.

    - [GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) - the most common copyleft license.
    - [AGPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) - similar, but it also requires that you give code back if you improve it then host it as a server. Better for server programs.

It depends on what you want. Many organizations will stay away from GPL code. Is getting changes to the code back more important to you? Then the GPL or AGPL is a good option. Do you care more about ease of compliance for developers and people who want to run servers? Then Apache 2.0 or MIT might be a better choice.",1514743995.0

BraveNewCurrency,"""I want to write open source software"" is a platitude that many people say, but few people find actionable because it's too vague.  So here is a better plan:

Like /u/asdlkjh321 said, if you want to help your target audience, spend some time with them. But also spend time searching for and understanding/cataloging all the open-source projects that can help your target audience.

Many useful open source projects suffer from two problems: 1) they aren't ""popular"", so are hard to find. By spending lots of time looking, you can bump into these obscure projects.  2) They are not 'packaged' as nicely as commercial software.  So you don't even need to be a programmer, just an ""advanced user"" to start helping people.

So just being knowledgeable of what is out there will help out immensely. (""Hey, I know this obscure software that might help you!"")

Now, when you are busy connecting people with software, you will constantly find ""problems"": The setup instructions weren't clear. The program crashed. The program is missing a feature.  Just noticing the problem and filing a ticket can be a great help. If you have time, you can try updating the docs. And if you see a bug or missing feature, take a stab at fixing it. (But be prepared for several rounds of feedback - often times projects have high standards of quality that aren't obvious to the beginner. It also helps to document the ""context"" of why you are adding a feature, sometimes that's not obvious.)

great to hear you're willing to participate in work towards common benefit. My own experience is that many open-source societes are not  easy to start working with. While contribution in general is accepted and appreciated, many organizations just do not have resources for tutoring newcomers and pointing easy-to-do-do first jobs for them. I would start with considering the following:

 * Find a software package that you already use yourself and know how it works. It has bug/issue tracker somewhere in the internet so develop bug fixes and post them to bug reports. They do get include into mainline software if they're good.

 * Participate in translation efforts of open source products, this is notorious black hole of many open source software items

 * First contact the persons already contibuting to software items you find yourself useful, ask for easy tasks to do - quite often they have something in mind and might be even thankful for your intended  efforts. 

The very idea of open-source software is that everybody *can* participate - for your changes to get included in main-line releases might require some social engineering but is definitly worht the effort.

tdammers,"- Being in control: free software does what I tell it to (and if it doesn't, I or someone I trust can change it); proprietary software does what the software vendor tells it to.
- Trust: with proprietary software, I have to blindly trust the vendor with my hardware and my data; with free software, I can audit the code myself, or choose whom to trust (distro maintainers, upstream maintainers, third-party auditors, community consensus, commercial vendors, etc.).
- Choice. In a typical Linux distro, almost all components are designed such that making drop-in replacements is as easy as possible, and often many altenatives exist.
- Configurability. Not only do I get to pick each part of my system, and configure it to my needs, I also get to write my own extensions, plugins and scripts, modify existing components to my needs, etc., and this is (usually) made as easy and transparent as reasonably possible.
- Automatability. Because everything is designed for tinkering, almost everything also has a command-line interface, which means that whatever I can do with it a script can do. This is pretty genius actually: the command-line interface was designed as a shared interface for humans and machines alike. The command line comes with a significant learning curve, especially if you're used to graphical interfaces, but once you're past the initial hump, the ability to take your manual workflows and gradually evolve them into automatic scripts is a giant productivity boost.
- No black boxes. While nobody understands every little detail of every component of a modern OS, free software is generally designed from the ground up to allow you to step in at any point and look inside. With proprietary software, there is always a point at which you are supposed to stop looking and just trust the documentation.
- Fewer hidden agendas. Software is generally built to maximally support the goals of the software maker; this is true for both free and non-free software. However, with free software, the makers are generally also the users, and as a user, you are always free to also become a maker, or to pay someone to become a maker on your behalf (and under your control). When users and makers are the same people, their goals will obviously align. Bad things that can (and often do) happen when those goals do not align include backdoors, privacy violations, undesired advertising, keeping security problems unpatched and/or secret, artificially crippling software, etc.
- No artificial restrictions. If the software doesn't have feature X, then it is because nobody has built it yet, not because someone built it but decided that you should not use it, or that you need to pay in order to use it. Likewise, if the software has feature X, but I don't want to use it, then I can remove it or turn it off; it's never a package deal that says ""if you want to use our software, you have to also accept all this other stuff running all the time"".
- No licensing shenanigans. Back at my first programming job, we used a Microsoft stack, and one of the consequences of that we couldn't run a proper staging environment, because that would have tripled the licensing costs, which we couldn't afford. So we ran code in production that had never been tested under realistic circumstances, and learned to be super careful, and it sucked.

jlpoole,"An anecdote:

I purchased an Epson T50000 for about $3,000 and I purchased the extended warranty for about $1,200.  Because I did not print very often, the ink delivery system would become clogged.  Over the three years, I had 3 service calls, each on Epson's account.  Each service call would cost about $2,000.  Now I'm out of warranty and have clogged heads, where I go or whether the printer just gets junked remains to be seen.

The Epson T50000 is a wonderful printer when the ink flows properly.   I bought it so I could print music on 25"" x 38"" heavy paper, and the paper handling and print work wonderfully.",1513702392.0
deelowe,"Most print cartridges have the printer head built into them or have some other mechanical components that aren't designed to work longer than the ink lasts. This isn't planned obsolescence. It's simple value engineering. In an attempt to make printers as cheap as possible, some important bits were moved into the cartridge itself. In an attempt to make cartridges as cheap as possible, those important bits are now designed to only last until the ink runs out.

Yes you CAN refill them in some cases. And YES it will likely continue to work. That's not the same as the manufacturer designing it that way in the first place. By the way, if there were some conspiracy here why don't we see the same practices show up for those types of printers?

AdultSwimExtreme,Look into the Epson Ecotank. ,1513703095.0
badspyro,"So, first of all, an open source printer is far out of reach - especially one with the quality you want, and as an inkjet.

Most inkjet printers work by having an array of tiny nozzles drilled by laser into either the printer (Epson), or in the cartridge its self (HP). There's a coil of wire around each nozzle, which when signaled, heats up a bubble of ink and forces some out onto the page. This is incredibly accurate, and almost impossible to manufacture without equipment most likely costing millions. I wish I was kidding.

The ones in the printer tends to mean that if the printhead clogs you chuck the printer, the printheads in the carts leads to more expensive carts instead.

I tell you this as I looked into it for a similar reason, and it frustrated me too. Until I found a solution.

 Continuous Ink Systems are ink tanks that attach to printers, and use far cheaper, bottled ink. These are designed for far larger printers and far larger print runs than you're looking at, but it allows you to run all kinds of fluids through. One company even sells kits to do it with edible inks for on cake icing sheets. On top of that (if memory serves me right), the Cannon IP7250 has a removeable and washable printhead matrix, meaning you can wash it if it gets jammed, and throw it in an ultrasonic bath if you've got serious issues. This printer can also take a CIS tank setup. If you want to experiment, this is the route I'd take.

ti3ed,"The article is interesting, but resumes give an entrance point. I have no idea where to even begin asking questions without being able to estimate a candidate's starting ability level.

I'd love to throw them on a team with another person for a day, but between the risk to data that we cannot afford to have leaked and only having one person evaluating the candidate unless we are going to set up cameras and spy on them all day, doing that is not really an option.

I like the idea, but they need to share HOW they are going to do it.

Honestly I'm in favor of community outreach training programs sponsored by companies that need developers. Find communities with disadvantaged folks then set up and fund a learning center for the skills you need. Make it free for the attendees. Those that perform well get interviews and paid internships that turn into entry level positions if they continue. Those that don't perform well can take program completion and/or internship to any other organization as a positive experience on their resume, or just decide that the work isn't for them.",1513024692.0

felipesabino,"While talking to some a bit more experienced developers (working for 1-2 years using git, github and other tools covered in this project) I noticed that most of the barriers they face to start contributing to open source is that they don’t know were to begin.

They even see that there are many open issues on open but most of them don’t know how to begin and how to do the first PR or think that getting used to a new code base will be a big hassle.

It would be nice to also add some links to projects that have beginners tags (like [danger does with the “you can do this” tag](https://github.com/danger/danger/labels/You%20Can%20Do%20This)) to encourage this kind of behavior from open source project maintainers as well",1512731333.0
miker95,"I'm so confused about what the actual goal for this project is? Do you think having people add their name on a list would suddenly give them the confidence to contribute to an open source project? Or am I missing something past the README?

I'm a developer, I've been employed as one for years, and was using git and GitHub long before that. I know HOW you contribute to projects, but I don't, because I don't think that's really the biggest problem with getting people to contribute to a project.

In reality, for me, it's the project itself, sure there are lots of small projects with simple setup, simple building, and stuff like that. But projects I want to contribute to are larger and have someone complex build systems, and then a severe lack of documentation on them.

Not being able to build a project, or install it, is a huge hurdle. And figuring out how to build something for several hours is not something I want to do.

I come from a background of not a whole lot of command line tools, most of my work is in Visual Studio so it's a fairly large hurdle to get over having to configure my own stuff, especially when projects don't have enough documentation other than to run 'make'

Developers who want to make their projects friendly to new contributors should not write documentation and the README in the mindset of them being an experienced developer. When writing documentation I always try my best to take a step back and think ""could someone without my knowledge of something understand this"" and that's a hard thing to do, but it's a necessary thing to do. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.",1512739520.0

disrooter,"I will try to elaborate more on the answers:

* Matrix is a protocol (mostly) for instant messaging and VoIP. It's like IMAP+SMTP for email. If a service support Matrix it can connect you to people on other services that are on Matrix (like sending an email from gmail to hotmail). With bots other services like Telegram, Discord, IRC, Slack, Gitter can be bridged to ""the Matrix""
* Matrix has a server reference open source implementation, Synapse, but it will be replaced at some point.
* Matrix devs launched also Riot (formely Vector) that is a client for Matrix and it's available as Web client (Open Source and self-hostable), Android and iOS apps. Every client is open source and can connect to the Matrix server of your choice during the login.
* You basically register to Matrix and you can access your account from the various clients, not only Riot.

To be fully independent on Riot you need to self-host a couple of things: Synapse and Riot web client. Then you can connect to your Synapse from Riot Web, Riot for Android or Riot for iOS. I hope it's clear.",1512607575.0
