Not at all.",1543577045.0
sublime8510,"FactoryBot won’t mock your calls to the DB. It simply fills your database so that you can retrieve your data when testing your implementation. 

It sounds like you’re looking to implement some kind of repository pattern so that you can inject an array backed implementation during tests, and use a DB backed implementation during prod or dev. ActiveRecord doesn’t have any facilities for this built into it. 

You COULD implement some kind of data access layer that sits below your business logic later, this way you’re never directly accessing ActiveRecord from your controllers/business logic. 

I tend to think this is a bit overkill. Usually people do this to keep their test suite fast. But there’s good facilities out there for running your test suite in parallel like CircleCI. 

At the end of the day, if you want to stub some calls to the DB via ‘allow(Model).to receive(:all) { some_array }’ that’s fine too. Just know that you probably should have some integrated coverage on that code too. ",1543585062.0
ignurant,"(Edit: Sorry, I just saw that you specifically noted RSpec, and my examples are given for Minitest; I'm going to leave it lying around though as I'm not fluent enough with RSpec to wing it in a comment box. I think everything still holds true in RSpec land.)

I'm surprised no one is coming to the defense of fixtures here. This is exactly the entire point of having fixtures handy. Based on some other comments from your experience with testing in C#, I just want to point out a quick high overview of what fixtures and factories are for, and Rails' take on testing this type of thing.

By default, Rails separates a dev/test/production env for you. The Test environment has it's own separate database configured and created for you. Ruby's dynamic nature gives us some tools to slip things data in and out with more ease than C#. This combination of the default rails setup, and Ruby is part of why there is a little bit less ceremony to the configuration of your test code compared to .net.

Fixtures are a way to define specific data for your database. It's like a specific database seed that has references you can use in your testing code. Factories are an alternative way to create test data that tends to be a bit more dynamic.

With the default of Minitest and Fixtures, each test is run with it's own DB transaction, and therefore the state of the test DB is consistent for each test. A lot of people who are down on fixtures seem to have a bad experience from a long time ago; they used to be quite clunky, but I strongly feel that is a thing of the past. For what you've described so far, fixtures are perfect.

A fixture is essentially a repository of database objects you can play with in your tests, just like your hash. Additionally, it will correctly build and reference model associations for you with very little effort, and give you names you can reference in your tests. An example fixture setup for you might look like this (Notice how this is very similar to defining a hash for data). (Hopefully all this example code actually works, I'm just punching this out in the comment box):

users:

    frequent_user:
      name: Guy
      email: guy@example.com

    new_user:
      name: New User Guy
      email: newguy@example.com

orders:

    expensive_order:
      user: frequent_user
      amount: 100000

    <%= 10.times do |i| %>
    order_<%= i %>:
      user: frequent_user
      amount: 10
    <% end %>


When your test runs, it sees 11 orders in the db attributed to a user referenced as `frequent_user`. If you hit your OrdersController, you should show all 11 orders. You can obviously play with this however you want.

    @user = users(:frequent_user)
    refute_empty @user.orders


Factories can be helpful if you have a lot of the `<%= 10.times do %>` stuff in play, need a lot of random things, or for some reason fixtures don't get you all the way. But often, fixtures _do_ get you very far. One common misconception is that fixtures get out of hand because you have to make a specific fixture for every possible testing configuration, which is not true. You can use the fixture as a starting point, and change the specific part under test, such as this incredibly over-simple example:

    test 'a user must have an email' do
      user = users(:frequent_user)
      user.email = nil
      assert_raise do
        user.save!
      end
    end

Here is a link to some more info on fixtures: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#the-low-down-on-fixtures
You should definitely give it a spin, they can be much faster and less resource intense than Factories. Factories certainly have their place, but I think they are often unnecessary and more complicated.",1543594478.0
petepete,"> Also, is using ActiveRecord in a controller action considered bad practice? (in .NET it is and you're supposed to extract it to a for example OrdersService class with an All() method if you want to be able to mock & test the database)

The general rule of thumb is not to use too much AR in the controller. Doing a `.find`, `.find_by`, `.all` or simple `.where` is fine, but if you have a more-complex query you probably should look into using [Scopes](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#scopes) in the model, which can be combined and tested separately.

So if you had a page where you display orders that are shipped and paid for you might have scopes like this:

    class Order < ApplicationRecord
      ...
      scope :shipped, ->{where.not(shipped_at: null)}
      scope :paid, ->{where.not(paid_at: null)}
    end

Then in your controller you could simply call `@orders = Order.paid.shipped`, the separate scopes will be combined with `and`.",1543591650.0

rebel_cdn,"I'm primarily a .NET developer, but I've dabbled with Ruby and Rails for a long, long time. So I understand what you're getting at. 

The right answer here is probably ""look at the tests other developers at your company have written, and do what they do"" to ensure that your tests fit it well with what is already there. 

Having said that, I have an idea you can try. It's probably not be a good idea to do in a real codebase, but it might be a good way to get a feel for the ways in which Ruby differs from C#. 

So remember that in Ruby, you can open up a class at runtime and modify. So in your test, you could potentially just do something like:

```
class Order 
  def self.all
    #return an array of Orders you've made for this test
  end
end
```

And now, in the test when your controller called Order.all, it'll get back your test orders instead of trying to get them from the database. 

As others have mentioned, there are libraries you'll want to use to help do all of this for you while you're testing. But if you're relatively new to Ruby, these libraries can seem like magic because you might not have a good mental model of how they're doing what they do. Once you've opened up a few classes at runtime yourself and understand how it works, you'll probably feel a lot more comfortable using libraries that mock things for you.

SuccessfulBread3,"Hey! 

&#x200B;

There is something to be said about leaning rails using scaffolds... but first, the answer I think you might be looking for...

&#x200B;

When you call a form\_for @post like you would in your new posts view, but in the dashboard view, you will get a Nil class error, like you said... because that view has no cluedo what @post is... in the dashboard#index controller you need to add the following:

&#x200B;

`@post =` [`Post.new`](https://Post.new)

&#x200B;

Now the controller has a variable called @post and can pass it to the view (because of the @ symbol.) Now the form knows that it's designed to be for a new post, and that will fix your error...

&#x200B;

On to the part that I sincerely hope you do read:

&#x200B;

So I try to persuade people learning rails not to use scaffolds as they actually hinder learning in my opinion, they do everything for you and you don't need to understand the inner workings of MVC or rails at all...

There is a lot of magic in there that you might be taking for granted, such as strong parameters, the whole MVC concept, active record, routing, HTTP requests etc that I really think you might benefit in learning about.

&#x200B;

I know that it's cool to make scaffolds because hey presto! you suddenly have a working app in 5 mins, but starting from scratch (and I'm not talking `rails g resource`, I'm talking `rails g model`) and working up from there will give you a better understanding of what everything does. If you really want to learn more about this stuff I'm happy to help you build an app from scratch and explain whatever you need me to :D just reach out.

thombruce,"It sounds to me, like others have suggested, that the best thing for your case would be Devise. It would simplify a great deal and alleviate you from having to trouble with matters like these.

**When might you *not* want to use Devise?**

I found myself running up against the need for JWTs when developing an API. Devise abstracts so much, I didn't know the first part about how to go about that properly. And the gems available to achieve it were too restrictive, or too incompatible with other custom authentication needs.

So I read into Devise's source code and discovered that Devise, by and large, doesn't actually handle the authentication at all. It is predominantly a wrapper around Warden. At which point I naturally looked into Warden's source code and started developing an authentication strategy of my own using that.

If you are doing this as a learning exercise, I recommend comparing Devise and Warden because it's relatively easy to get a sense for what each does and how the former builds on top of the latter.

Warden's approach of using strategies to handle multiple forms of authentication is also very easy to get to grips with.

Ultimately, I think in learning all of this you'll learn something very useful indeed: why you probably always want Devise and how to extend it for any authentication use case.",1543546469.0

&#x200B;

Edit:  Without writing a whole blog post of my own, my basic testing strategy looks like this: Write system tests for every high level feature.  Use a JS driver if JS is required, otherwise stick with rack-test, because it's way faster than driving a real browser, headless or not.  If there's a lot of branching logic, you don't necessarily need to cover everything in a system test.  For logic that's not tested in a system test, write unit tests for the relevant model/PORO/decorators/etc. methods and controllers.  I try not to test the same thing twice, so if something is covered in a system test, I don't always write a unit test around code used in that feature.  If it's a complex method, though, I will write a unit test if other logic branches are being tested, just so those unit tests completely cover the method.  When writing system tests, don't be afraid to test multiple things in the same test.  They are testing a feature, so expect multiple assertions, compared to unit tests, which might only have one assertion in a given test.  System tests are slow to set up, so making multiple assertions relating to a single feature in a single system test is a worthwhile trade-off.

Aside from blog posts, reading through the tests of gems and larger Rails projects (e.g. Discourse, etc.) will be immensely helpful.

Lastly, look at tests as accomplishing the following: Testing for *regressions* as your code progresses, and documenting your code.  Someone should be able to read your tests and understand what your code is supposed to be doing (that's more of a spec/rspec mentality, but applies regardless of if you are using a testing library that ends in ""spec"").

Edit: however, best practices are only guidelines & it's up to you to ultimately decide when it's necessary to break the rules.

For example, I had 2 models for addresses.  One for WorkAddress and the other for HomeAddress.

jryan727,"The current state of things is really confusing. Basically, you can replace sprockets/the asset pipeline with a webpack. A single webpack replaces a single asset manifest, but unlike sprockets, it packages JS, CSS, and images together. 

Why use Webpack? You get ES6 support out of the box (thanks to Webpacker, which is the library that configures Webpack for your Rails environment and abstracts some concepts and bridges the gap between Rails and Webpack). That’s a nice plus. You get modern JS things like tree shaking, modularity, etc. Basically, if you want to develop modern JS in a Rails app, you can use Webpacker. 

npm: this manages JS dependencies (think of it as bundler and rubygems, but for JS). Rails didn’t really have a good solution for this before. You had to use a Rails gem that wrapped the library or rails-assets.

Yarn: this also manages JS dependencies. Using npm (lol). You can find resources that go into greater detail why one might use yarn instead of npm to manage JS dependencies. The Rails way is to use Yarn. 

So let’s say you want to install a JS dependency via Yarn. How do you use that in your application? With either sprockets OR a Webpack! Both work. You can include your JS library installed via Yarn in a sprockets manifest or import it into a file in your Webpack. Your call. 

Also, you don’t have to choose. You can use the asset pipeline and Webpacks. I have a project that has this somewhat standalone video player built into it. That player is built using Vue.js and packages its JS/CSS with Webpack (which is really cool because we can use .vue components). The rest of the app uses the asset pipeline/sprockets.  

I’m by no means an expert here. I’ve been a rails developer for 8 years and this topic still confuses me. If I’ve made any mistakes or left anything out, I hope someone can drop in and correct me. This is what I’ve gathered from trying so sort this out myself. ",1542914160.0

Webpack (which webpacker wraps) is the actual build tool, handling stuff like minification and so on. The asset pipeline is conceptual; its implementation is sprockets. Webpack replaces sprockets.

Additionally, avoid using memory pointers in ~~active~~/sidekiq jobs arguments (activejob uses [globalid](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html#globalid)). Who knows if that pointer will still point to what you expect by the time the job re-runs or whatever. Common practice instead is to pass id as an argument then look up record in the job. This ensures your jobs are **idempotent**: `PostNotifierRelayJob.perform_later(notify_follower.id)`

jakenberg,"Both are fine. I'll use will\_paginate for example.

in\_groups\_of is a sort of dirty pagination. Either gem is going to *replace* it. 

You should handle pagination at the controller level because you will be accepting a 'page' parameter from the client:

`@posts = Post.paginate(page: params[:page])`  
Now in your client you don't have to worry about it because the page number is in the url - `http://localhost/posts?page=15000`:

`<% @posts.each do |group| %>`

So this is fine, but you might want to get a little fancier than that since each page change will completely reload the page in this case. An ajax call is your answer, but the concept remains the same.

As for your question of  which internship, this goes back to the (timeless?) debate of whether Ruby/Rails is still relevant in 2018. Javascript has made a lot of progress but I appreciated the framework approach when I started. Ruby on Rails is very opinionated and there is typically some consensus around tooling, and practices. Javascript is still very much a build your own framework from a collection of libraries. I think that takes a higher degree of skill and familiarity.

In particular:

- PHP is dying. There are plenty of PHP applications still in existence, but they're often legacy applications and fewer and fewer new applications are written in PHP every year. It's a much harder skill to find work for.

I think working in a dev shop doing small-medium sized clients, you often get away with no penalty for taking shortcuts or not learning how to follow best practices at the cost of delivering on time to clients.

The second job will help give you a much more well rounded perspective on the full scope of what goes into making a production project.

Based on the log you posted, no params are being parsed from the request to `/settings`.  You will be able to see this clearly if you add `Rails.logger.debug ""PARAMS: #{params}""` immediately inside `def settings`.

The routes that you showed would produce endpoints for `/users` and `/users/<user id>/stripe_accounts`.

A single integration test that touches many parts of the app will do wonders to shed light on what breaks as you start upgrading gems, and will highlight areas where you’ll want to fill in unit tests.

SminkyBazzA,"I recently did a very similar upgrade path, but with the benefit of a decent test set. Took about two working weeks, and most of my time was split between replacing deprecated code, and fixing tests to make them pass again.

Stay on Ruby 2.3 until you're on Rails 5.1+, there shouldn't be anything that requires more, and it's just an added complication with older versions of gems not supporting it 'yet'.

The Rails Guide for upgrading versions is very handy for saying what is likely to break.

Use railsdiff.org to see what changes are made to the configuration files, make/understand as many as possible before running the `rake rails:update` (`rails app:update` on 5.x) task - it will happily overwrite your custom changes so always check the diffs before committing.

For gems I took the optimistic approach of first updating bundler and then specifying the Rails version in the Gemfile but removing all other gem version limitations and then running `bundle update rails`. If it works then lucky you, just review the list of version changes to see which ones have jumped a long way, and make a note to check their changelogs. If it doesn't, then you'll need to look at where the conflicts lie, and re-add a few version limits. Some gems may not be needed at all.

Use a separate branch, commit often, experiment! Deal with deprecations first because they just clutter up your log file.

pikopuyo,"The problem is that your associations in `ShareTransfer` have the same name as their foreign keys, so when you try to assign the foreign key from the parameters (a String), Rails thinks you are assigning the association directly (should be a Member) and raises this error.

To fix it, you can either change the name of the foreign key column, for instance appending `_id` as is the convention in Rails, or change the name of the associations. I think it's better to change the foreign key columns if you can, appending `_id` to them: it's going to be less surprising for other developers and might avoid other problems with Rails.


Also, this is not related to this error, but I believe that the `share_transfers` association in `Member` probably won't work, since Rails by default will look for a `member_id` in `ShareTransfer`, and that doesn't exist. You will have to create two associations for each of the foreign keys, for example:

```
class Member
  has_many :given_share_transfers, class_name: ""ShareTransfer"", source: :member_from

***Note: This is just a guess without looking at the api in-depth.***

If you wanting to put it into some sort of table, you would code the table around it, something like this.

    <table>
        <thead>    
            <tr>
                <th>Currency</th>
                <th>Amount</th>
                <th>Card</th>

            <% @balance.pending.each do |balance| %>
                <tr>
                    <%= as_table_row(balance[""currency""]) %>
                    <%= as_table_row(balance[""amount""]) %>
                    <%= as_table_row(balance[""source_types""][""card""]) %>
                </tr>
            <% end %>
        </tbody>
    </table>

What this code right here is saying is get all the pending data and I want to loop over that data, which is when you can create a helper method which will build up some HTML and return it, for example;

    def as_table_row(value)    
        return ""<td>#{value}</td>""
    end

You should end up with a table at the end with all the details you want. This is just a nice, 'neat' way of doing it and i'm sure other people will correct me later.

kobaltzz,"It really depends if the recruiter works for the company or if they are a third party company. I've done plenty of hiring in the past and companies have used both external and internal recruiters at different times. From my experience neither really knew much about the actual job aside from the job description. If you're confident with your skill set and haven't inflated your resume with a bunch of lies, you should be okay. Just play the game and get through to an actual hiring manager interview (or to the hiring team of developers) who you would actually be working with. These are the folks that you want to be candid with and really set the good impressions. The recruiters are really checking boxes of requirements set forth by these people. A lot of times, recruiters that work for the actual company will have pretty high turnover anyways. Personally, I will not speak with any third party recruiter when I am looking for a job. I will target the actual company and go that route.

I've had recruiters who passed on resumes to me that were over 15 pages long as well as some that appears to have been DHH's resume with the name changed. I've seen some with zero development experience and others claiming more than 12 years of Ruby on Rails experience.

Side note on the resume. Keep it to the point. The 15 page resume mentioned, I did not look past the first two pages. If you cannot ""wow"" someone on the first page then your chances goes down significantly. Keep in mind that the people interviewing you have their daily jobs and while an addition to their team is important for their future growth, a lot of times, they're wanting to get back to their actual job. So, make a lasting impression.

Do your research about the company and find out their interests. Try to see things from the company perspective. They want to see if they will be able to increase their bottom line through your employment. If you cannot provide proof of this potential by meeting or exceeding their expectations, they may hold off for someone who does. 

A lot of times when we interview, we have multiple applications out to different companies; just as each company has multiple candidates. We often get excited about having an interview with a company. A company does not get excited about having an interview with you. Emotion is left out of it from the company perspective. We as people put emotion in the equation because this is such a personal/life-changing event for us. This can make one nervous and perform poorly on an interview. Side note: being passionate is different than being emotional. Passion is good.

WrathOfTheSwitchKing,"I support database level validations in general.  This gem is definitely welcome.

I've given a bit of thought to how database validation in general could work in ActiveRecord.  AR adapters should have some way of signaling database level constraint violations to AR, along with what constraint has been violated.  That signal *could* be raising specified errors with appropriate fields describing what constraint has been violated.  AR could then rescue these (assuming we called `save` and not `save!`) and update `errors`.

But, AR is already unreasonably slow and raising errors is a performance concern.  A faster but less elegant solution could just specify that adapters return something like a `ConstraintViolation` object that AR would understand and process into `errors`.

I'd love to do a proof of concept for this, but digging around in the guts of ActiveRecord scares me and I'm not even sure all the databases AR supports report errors with enough information to make this design possible.

jakenberg,"IME react-on-rails gem is not effective in virtually any scenario.

Some of the immediate benefits of simply running your client and server separately are:

1. Full backtraces in JavaScript console while debugging. Alternatively, prepare to read through a lot of minified webpack code. This is a huge deal.
2. Ability to better segregate profiling performance, causing you to more easily identify other related issues such as memory leaks.
3. Set up genesis project as simply as: \`rails new my-api && express my-client\`. Worrying about version mismatch and other configuration issues are going to end up being more complex than running those two generators any day. I have sunk hours into making something that webpack needs play nicely in a rails ecosystem knowing full well the two would have been fine if they were just separate.
4. Reduced architectural headache later on when you ultimately decide to break them apart - as everyone eventually does. To be specific, you might be clever enough to create, say, a jbuilder template that injects all sorts of data from the rails back-end into your react code before its sent off to client (aka prerendering). Problem is you end up with a marginal performance gain and a huge amount of work to ever break this apart when you start supporting multiple clients or want to open up your back-end api to 3rd-party developers.

Conceptually speaking, react-on-rails really doesn't make very much sense. You are taking a blob of code and transferring it to the user's browser. It is trivial in this day and age to serve that blob through any major server provider's tools. In fact, otherwise hugely complicated tasks such as serving your site on a CDN are straightforward.

&#x200B;

The **one** caveat I'm aware of to separate services is that your deploy process is probably not as straightforward because now you have to install two services. Fortunately, this too is trivial because any major provider such as Heroku has support for multiple buildpacks. AWS can be split between an S3 upload script for client and ELB/ECR for rails app. So on and so on.

You can even set it up so certain routes render the same view and you can leverage browser routing if you need to.

eksaurus,"The answer largely depends on what you want from your codebase and how you’re working on it. 

Splitting them out into separate entities increases complexity and overhead in the short term (at least!) but may make it easier for multiple people to collaborate, as the React bits aren’t tied up in Rails and vice-versa. It also potentially makes it easier to swap out your front or back end at will, though in practice this doesn’t matter as often as you might think.

On the other hand, using a gem gives you a lot of convenience, but just like any other monolith you run the risk of very tightly coupling different domains (this is not unique to the use case you describe).

In general, you need to create models on your end first and then sync them to Shopify in `after_commit`. Some things to keep in mind:

* If you update or delete a product you may also do need to do so in Shopify. You can use `after_commit_create`, `after_commit_update`, and `after_commit_destroy` for that. You should use a background job for actually *calling* Shopify. Hooks should only schedule the right job.
* You may use `before_*` hooks to mark your model as dirty so that it's easy to restart the sync jobs for models that weren't synced for some reason. In that case, the sync jobs should mark the models as clean after completing.
* Ensure you isolate yourself properly from Shopify in your test suite in order to avoid mirroring test products there.
* Some updates on your end may not need to be mirrored in Shopify. For example, you may change an attribute that isn't copied over to Shopify. You need to take this into account in order to avoid performing excessive updates.
* Some updates may require you to create or destroy the model in Shopify. For example, if you have a flag `published` and mirror only published products then setting it from `false` to `true` should create the model in Shopify and changing it from `true` to `false` should destroy it.",1541499181.0
jonnyom,"To be honest this feels like a bad pattern as you mentioned. You're essentially making Shopify your source of truth as opposed to your own datastore.

I would save your data yourself first (ideally abstracted away using a service architecture so your controller never really has to touch AR and only handles domain models) and then write to Shopify. If Shopify fails you still have a record in your datastore and you can retry with the data that you've stored.

Writing to a third party and relying on their system before saving your own data feels like a timebomb waiting to go off. What happens if Shopify are down for a period of time and you just keep retrying and never save the data? ",1541472170.0

It is trivial to bypass and cannot guarantee that only images and video are uploaded.

SagaciousCrumb,"The reason that you typically group the actions for a specific model into one controller is so the the URLs/Routes are grouped together intelligently.

`GET /books -> index`

`GET /books/:id -> #show`

`GET /books/new -> #new`

`POST /books/create -> #create (has no view, redirects to show)`

`GET /books/edit -> #edit`

`PATCH /books/:id -> update (has no view, redirects to show)`

`DELETE /books/:id -> #delete (had no view, redirects to index)`

You COULD pus these in separate controllers, but then you'd have to define the routes manually, rather than just putting `resources :books` in your routes file. That one line will generate all the above routes.

This is more of Rails convention over configuration, when you do things are Rails expects, you need very little code.

For basic CRUD operations it keeps all the code related to CRUDing a specific model in one class, so you can see it all at once.

&#x200B;

Once you application grows in complexity you'll be dealing with more than one model on some pages, and by then you'll have controllers that aren't doing any CRUD work at all, such as a Dashboard. In those cases you break the convention. The `#index` method might load data form 10 different models to show it all in one place. And it might have an `#edit` method that lets you change what appears on the index. There probably us no Dashboard model, so you're really editing user settings, but conceptually it makes sense to put that logic on the `DashboardController#edit` method. In this case you would define the routes manually because they don't conform to the standard **resourceful routing** framework.",1541347684.0
jaryl,"You should have as many Controllers per model as there are logical perspectives in your domain. If your admins need to manage your products, it shouldn’t be in the same controller as buyers on your site. Likely you will have `admin/products` and `products` routes.

You will have similar actions like index for both Controllers but obviously they will show very different things (action logic and view templates). Putting them into multiple Controllers reduces the amount of if/else logic you need. You can also specify your authorisation logic on a controller level more cleanly if kept separate. 

Look at GitHub, they also have some very complex actions that are extracted out into its own controller.

the_jester,"It sounds like what you're struggling with isn't so much PHP vs Ruby (on Rails), but a major change in programming paradigm you may not have been given the name for.

Writing code of the overall style of ""If this query saves, do X else do Y"" is called imperative programming. [Wiki Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming).

Rails is organized in a (mostly) object-oriented style of programming. [Wiki Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

To grossly oversimplify both, when doing imperative programming you dictate instructions to a single omniscient butler; ""Do A, then B, then C unless X. Then..."" When doing object-oriented programming you instead define a set of relevant nouns (aka object) that share common behaviors (aka methods). ""This is a dog. It can bark(), run(), eat() and sleep()."" To achieve an overall intent you then interact with your object's methods.

Rails specifically even divides things up further with a so-called ""MVC"" design. [Wiki Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). This means what you might be used to thinking of as a list of actions in PHP are instead thought of as first (objects) and then kind of into ""sub objects"" across the model, view, and controller.

- Adding a `#find_or_create_by_digest` method, and maybe some others

- We have a bunch of fields that we want a record to be unique by

- We don't want to maintain large multi-column unique indexes

- We use the digest to find/create unique records

Someone mentioned using the params: option in routes (which I was) so that you could use \`find\_by! slug: params\[:slug\]\` instead of \`find\_by slug: params\[:id\]\` so I removed \`params: :slug\` from my nested albums route and updated my set\_artist\_album function to use \`find\_by slug: params\[:id\]\` and now it works exactly as I want it to!

Yes, you'll be interacting with Ruby and the Rails CLI with it, but stuff like directory traversal is not a Ruby or a Rails topic, so this subreddit technically isn't quite the best forum to get help with it. You'd be better suited on a Windows subreddit for Command Prompt related questions like this. Just for future reference.

However, the command you are in fact looking for is `cd`. So `cd C:\Users\Documents` should work fine. What I'm assuming you are trying to do is go to your specific user's Documents folder and I'm assuming you have a space in your username like `Foo Bar`, right? If so, your problem is because `cmd.exe` splits arguments on a space. So, a command like `cd C:\Users\Foo Bar\Documents` is actually going to try to put you in `C:\Users\Foo` not `C:\Users\Foo Bar\Documents`. To deal with this, you should put the folder path in double quotes, which will tell `cmd.exe` to treat everything in these quotes as one argument, no splitting on the space. So, the correct command would be `cd ""C:\Users\Foo Bar\Documents""`.

The solution from /u/snajfowy uses an early return to avoid this, but is not what Rubocop is suggesting. It will resolve the warning, though some teams don't like to use early returns as they can be difficult to reason about at times.

/u/hernanat suggests disabling the cop as their team is not a fan of the rule. This is likely because guard clauses can be hard to spot when scanning the code quickly. Thoughtbot's style guide (https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/style/ruby) has the same recommendation.

Compilation and optimization of Javascript.  It does a good number of other things, too, but that's the high level.

Possibly.  See previous answers.  Depends on how you set it up.  You can set something up where, yes, this works fine.

> I've written several decorators using Draper. Do these get exposed to Vue or do I need another solution for these?

Again, same thing.  Depends on how you use Vue.  Draper helps you render views.  You could be using Vue and still rendering views through Rails.  Or not, you could also go the full/pure API single page app route.  Or a hybrid of both.

> Would it be best to split my Vue front end into its own git repository, or keep it within the same repo as the rails app?

I personally tend to keep them in the same repo while the project is small.  This also, again, depends on how you're using it.  Full single page app powered by an API tends to lend itself better to a separate repo.

> How would deployment to prod work after I've implemented Vue? Do I just deploy the Vue piece to it's own separate container on my droplet?

the_brizzler,"What??? It sounds like you are trying to use rabbitMQ to pass the token to the main app and decrypt it??? This makes no sense and a poor application of rabbitMQ. If your JWT signed and encrypted or just signed? If it is just signed, then your store service can read all the info in the token just fine and no need to attempt to look up the user in the main app, you can tell if the token is valid since it is signed with an asymmetric private key (meaning you don't need the secret key to read it and tell if it is valid) Make sure you don't have sensitive user information in the token though since anyone can read it when it is only signed.

&#x200B;

Regardless if the JWT is encrypted, signed, whatever...you don't want people making API calls to your store service and main service...users shouldn't be able to to hit those directly. A proper infrastructure has what is typically called an API gateway. All API calls come in through the API gateway which handles your authentication ( for you your token validation and decrypting if needed) and then if the request has proper authentication (user is logged in and the log in happens in the api gateway level as well or you can have the API gateway call an auth service which has public routes), then you proxy the request onto the intended service/endpoint (and you can append custom headers if needed to indicate the user making the request, etc. so the endpoint has that information). This would solve all your problems of trying to pass your token around and decrypt it.

TLDR: I think you are using RabbitMQ wrong, and the way you are planning your infrastructure seems wrong. Do yourself a favor and instead use an API gateway to solve your problems ( here is a free and easy one to setup [https://konghq.com/kong-community-edition/](https://konghq.com/kong-community-edition/)).

seainhd,"I’ve seen a couple posts from you about this situation. 

I applaud your drive to finish the task, but want to let you know that your current strategy should be altered to more cleanly achieve this.

Think of your Order as a SHOPPING cart. Add a status column that says “loading” as the first state. You can fill that table up without worrying about the stripe charges.

After the stripe charge is successful, you’ll send a quick Ajax request to your DB to update the order status to “charged” and you’ll be able to fill in other stripe data, like charge token, stripe user, etc.

With the status column on your ORDERS you’ll also be able to track ABANDONMENT.

If you insist on doing it all on one page, create a remote form (look it up in the rails docs) for the order and another stripe form. These are separate forms and not nested. On a successful submit of the order form, populate the stripe form with extra needed info (is there any?), hide the order form and show the stripe form using javascript.

    get '/:continent/:country/:city' => 'city#show', as: :city

**Beware**: You typically dont want to nest more than 3 times...

Set the relations up between the models. For example: a continent has and belongs to many countries, a country has and belongs to many cities and a city just belongs to a country.

Once you've set the relations up, you need to go to your controller and instead of using 'Model.find', you use 'Model.friendly.find'. Find all your data you need like this. ""@continent = Continent.friendly.find(params\[:continent\])"". This will look at the params and find the :continent param within the URL address.

Once you have everything, you can use these variables within the view.

I hope this helps.

**Please note**: This is the way I would do it and theres probably a much easier and tidier way of doing this.

**Also note:** If you wanted, you could create index and show pages for each model so you can see all the countries within that continent and then you can see all the cities within that country.

(This is a method to determine Cell surface markers to identify cell types, used extensively in diagnosis of various leukemia and lymphomas)

It’s very much still in active development :)

Rails(obviously), active admin, searchkick(ElasticSearch) and bootstrap 

I feel like I would classify myself as very much a beginner - I have learnt from teamtreehouse and gorails. I do this currently more out of my own interest / hobby, I am a trained scientist working in Flow Cytometry and Stem Cell Transplantation.

My next goal is to try add in a sort of autocomplete ‘drop down’ field to my search box, I have read it can be done with jquery or typeahead... but it’s quite a challenge for me to figure out :)

I’d link my repo on gitlab but it’s 3.30am currently and I need sleep :) if I remember I’ll edit it in when I wake up lol

Any advice, feedback, useful guides on the above etc is greatly appreciated! ",1540402896.0

* Another item I have implemented in the past is a velocity modifier which affects the ""watershed count"" based on the viewers to reporter ratio -- it is usually important to mix in a poster/reporter ""trust"" level based on their history (# posts/#of removals/create date etc). 
* Soft deletes go into a queue for admin review,  admin controls allow admin to mark as ""ok"" and override the watershed count (effectively turning off report for a post).

https://swagger.io/solutions/api-design/",1539700080.0
highskyd,"This is surprisingly relevant to what I'm working on right now. I've been upgrading our API to fast_jsonapi and refactoring the way we parse/cast parameters in controllers. While planning the upgrade, I shopped around for decent extensible solutions for parameter parsing (we do some funky things to enable sparse field-sets), and I actually ended up preferring `apipie` over some other popular options (like `stronger-parameters`). `apipie` was a godsend for parsing parameters, but I was in the same boat as you re: adding code to controllers. But because I liked the way it handled parameter parsing so much, I decided to work around the controller bloat. 

I ended up deciding to dynamically generate boilerplate model parameters from a set of `field_definition`s defined on models. Our use case is sort of graphQL-lite (allowing the API user to request sparse fields, associations, pass arguments to filters/fields, etc.) and the `field_definition` objects act like a graphQL schema. In the controllers you just end up with one line that looks like this:

`autodefine_api model_class: User` 


I'm currently working on turning this pattern (along with some other GraphQL-esque tooling I've developed) into a gem in the near-ish future. That said, this part of the equation is really straightforward - just loop through some model constants and make the right calls to `apipie`. 


Again, I was mainly concerned with parameter parsing, so if that half of the equation isn't useful for you, `apipie` probably won't be either. However, controller bloat was (for me) eminently reasonable to manage. Basically I think its worth looking into if (a) you have a lot of parameter casting code in your controllers and (b) your parameters are mostly related to model attributes/scopes.

1. I have bash/zsh aliases set up for various customized searches. For example a `js-ag` alias to search only `./app/assets/javascript`
2. I like to use the same search tool everywhere. `ag` also works more or less as a drop in replacement for `grep` you can use for searching streams and stuff

I'm playing `enum` right now. What I've done is create a `Post` model that has `status_id` which is pulled from the `enum`.

    class Post < ApplicationRecord
        enum status: [:status1, :status2, :status3]
    end

I want to be able to show 1 random Post from each status in a view. I'm just not able to figure out the RailsWay to do it.

This is the best I have come up with so far.

    class ViewsController < ApplicationController
      def index
        @status1 = Post.where(status: 0).sample
        @status2 = Post.where(status: 1).sample
        @status3 = Post.where(status: 2).sample
      end
    end

View

    index.html.erb
    
    <p><%= @post.name %></p>
    <p><%= @post.status1.humanize %></p>
    
    <p><%= @post.name %></p>
    <p><%= @post.status2.humanize %></p>
    
    <p><%= @post.name %></p>
    <p><%= @post.status3.humanize %></p>

I get what I'm wanting to see, but I feel like there is a much better way code this. *So, I guess my question is, what is a more Rails Way to do this?*

I tried this before using two Models. One for Posts and one for Status, then I used has\_many and belongs\_to associations but didn't come up with any better way to get the random view I wanted.

I'm still a noob to rails and hopefully didn't butcher this post too much. But if anyone has any suggestions on how to accomplish what I'm looking for, I'd be grateful. Thanks in advance.

Depending on how the data is being processed, you could try **streaming** from the client side or server side.

1. Streaming Server Side - You could still accept 500 strings and stream each json object back as they are found. This would work the exact same as streaming a CSV. You would not be trying to return a valid JSON object because that requires the entire result to be processed and returned as an array. Instead each line of the response would be the JSON object for the string. As each response comes in you can process it on the client by parsing each line as a JSON object. This also has the benefit of being very memory efficient because you only need to process 1 record at a time and then forget about it.
2. Streaming Client Side - This is similar to how AWS handles S3. You make a request for a folder with a million files, they return the first 10 and if you iterate past those it returns the next 10 and continues as needed.

jsb151,"I use rescue_from for nearly everything. For ActiveRecord saves, I always use update_attributes! / save! instead of update_attributes / save for things in models, controllers, services, etc, as I always expect them to succeed, and I want to know otherwise. It also allows code to stay very DRY, as there are no conditionals in controllers. For example you call save! on a record in a controller, and if it fails, the exception is picked up by the rescue_from in the ApplicationController, and responds appropriately with the new or edit action, depending if the record was persisted or not.

Same goes with my API. It allows you to centralize your error handling responses into a single spot (I put it in a concern, and include it in the Base API controller, e.g. RecordInvalid => 422, UnpermittedParameters => 400, ParameterMissing => 400, StateMachines::InvalidTransition => 422, etc",1539128991.0

saintsintosea,"To answer your main question, it's because `Order.find_by(video: present?)` is nil. You need to always ensure that order will exist, or more practically, have a backup for when it is not found.

Edit: A key distinction here is that, unlike `where`, which returns an empty relation if none are found, `find_by` will return a single entity OR `nil` if none are found. I don't know what behavior your app wants but you might be needing `Order.where(video: present?)` if you want a relation?

Another bug you have is that you're sharing the same `params[:page]` for all of your relations. So if someone navigates to page 3 of all orders, it will also give you page 3 of all completed orders. You need to use unique param names when you send in your page requests, like ""all_orders_page"", ""completed_orders_page"", etc.

Additionally, as a tangent to your question, it seems you might have a typo? You are searching for Orders where sellers can be buyers (current_buyer), is that correct? If so, I would also recommend this as a starting point to also help clean up your code (I kept your find_by here, please see above edit if you want to actually return multiple orders):

Perhaps this is my past talking, but upgrading a Rails 2 to Rails 3 app was rather annoying in the `routes.rb` department.

cmd-t,"First of all, just a heads up: the code pretty far from what you would expect in a rails project. It seems you haven't done any tutorials, because they often detail how to work with routes, resources and controllers. This is how your code above could be written (roughly, there is no validation handling) according to conventions in rails:

    # routes.rb
    namespace :api do
      resources :cars
    end
    
    # cars_controller.rb
    class CarsController < ApplicationController
      def index
        render json: Car.all
      end
    
      def show
        @car = Car.find(params[:id])
        render json: @car
      end
    
      def create
        @car = Car.create(car_params)
        render json: @car
      end
    
      def update
        @car = Car.find(params[:id])
        
        @car.update(car_params)
        render json: @car
      end
    
      def destroy
        @car = Car.find(params[:id])
        @car.destroy
        render json: @car
      end
    
      protected
      def car_params
        params.require(:car).permit(:model, :num_wheels, :color, :realm_uuid)
      end
    end

You also shouldn't be using `attr_accessor` , since rails will handle attribute assignment for you. `attr_accessor` overrides the attribute setters. That's why nothing gets stored in the database. Also, `update_attributes` (which is currently called `update` in newer versions of rails) saves changes to the database every time you call it, so in your example, for every attribute in `params[:car]`, you perform a separate database query.

These mistakes are mostly caused by unfamiliarity with rails. After doing one or two tutorials things should 'click' probably.",1538725522.0
sac_boy,"It looks like your params are nested under `params[:car]` if your update code path is correct. So you need to use `params[:car][:model]` etc when creating your car.

> When I make a post through postman, It says that the car is created

Ok, I'm guessing you just have no validation that protects against nil in those records, so the save succeeds. You can change that to `@car.save!` to make it throw an exception if it fails.

> when I render json: @car, I see that all the values are correct

Are you 100% sure of that? And it's the 'create' code path you tested? If that's true then my previous statement (that you are just accessing params incorrectly when creating the car) can't be true. But if there *are* values in there, I would expect the save to either fail entirely (no record created), or save the record with its values. I don't get how your record with id 38 would be created if the validation failed. **Unless of course your create code path works fine**, creates and saves the Car with the properties you expect, and then your update path sets all its properties to nil (because the params *aren't* nested under `params[:car]`) and saves that. Make very sure that you are testing a create action by itself and not a create followed by an update.

You can easily make sure of all of this by simply doing a `puts ""CAR #{@car.inspect}""` at various points in the function, then looking at your server output in the console and searching for CAR after you make a request.

I'm not going to critique the code in general, but I would suggest you make a controller test spec before you go any further, to test that the create and update behaviours work as you expect. I'll always test a controller through a test spec before I ever try hooking up a front end. This goes for every single class you make--create the tests at the same time as the class, test it before you try to hook it up to anything else, and you'll have the benefit of a class you can rely on + a growing test suite. If you do this you won't need to muck around by testing your controller through your front end, and you can work on your front end with complete confidence in your controller.",1538669917.0

ActiveModel_Dirty,"First off, this post is hard to read and you're kind of all over the place with how you're explaining the problem. It's a lot easier if you're concise with the problem you're facing.

Anyway, I'm confused by what you're trying to do. The first link is describing admin approval for users but the second link is creating an admin role. Which are you wanting to do? They're two different things. One is approving an account and allowing someone to log in, the other is making them an administrator.

As for your question in the edit, did you look at the accepted answer or did you just reference the question?

you don't want to link to `edit_user_path` you want to link to `user_path` and ensure that you're using a `PATCH` request as noted in the answer. Note `method: :patch`.

`link_to(""Unlink your facebook account"", user_path(@user, :facebook_uid => nil), :method => :put, :confirm => ""Are you sure?"")`

So in your case it'd be something like:

`link_to user_path(user, {admin: true}), method: :patch`

It's worth noting that now Rails prefers `method: :patch` over `:put`

I’m still learning too, but a model is essentially a ruby-class representation of some data in the db. The routes direct a uri call to a specific controller and a specific method within that controller. The controller can access a model for data from the db, and then render a view using that data.

in0pinatus,"Before adopting a gem, check:

• It is popular,  
• It is currently maintained,  
• It actually does what you need,  
• It is compatible with everything else you have (or can be trivially adapted), and  
• It is not an overengineered framework, for something better expressed as simple and domain-specific POROs, that will leave you feeling imprisoned by the framework later.

This last one I call my Trailblazer Rule but it may also be a reason not to use, say, a decorator framework, in contexts where all you needed was a delegating presenter or a helper method. A.k.a. ""Too Much Scaffolding, Not Enough Building"". The ability to assess when a full-featured framework will create net long-term utility (rather than crippling technical debt) is a major skill for all developers, and comes from experience and experimentation; by which I mean, trying stuff out and making lots of mistakes.

In the case of an e-commerce site, I'd say it's usually a mistake to ignore the established solutions. This sounds like a maintenance boat anchor. The time to roll your own is if you're actively inventing a new e-commerce architecture e.g. you are founding the next Shopify. In which case the service core IP is your own code and should remain so to preserve agency.

Pro tip: always read the source code before adopting a gem, because I guarantee you'll be reading it later, under pressure. Aside from building familiarity, this is also my primary means for assessing whether something really does what I need or whether it contains some horrifying but undocumented gotchas. 

To answer the other specific question, I have an e-commerce system that was created from scratch. It has 54 gems in the production Gemfile group, of which four are in-house and six are privately maintained forks.",1538271059.0

For large rails apps I've used both service objects and engines as a means of isolating business logic and to me, services are a good route to take.

I think the thing that's appealing about Trailblazer is that it's a ""packaged"" design pattern that forces you to stick to it. Which can be appealing at some level and an easy way to get started, but ultimately there's nothing preventing you from just picking a different design pattern and sticking to it, which will result in more flexibility for you and newcomers down the road.

**Good stuff:**

* **I love Operations for service objects**. Operations are a great service object pattern. You might consider **dry-rb** instead though.
* **Reform is great for form objects** (Every new version I hope that `include ActiveModel::Model` be good enough, and every time it isn't).
* The concepts directory is a nice way to organize a project.

**Bad stuff:**

* The loader will happily overwrite Rails objects with concept modules. I spent **weeks** tracking down a bug caused by this.
* The Operation API has numerous small gotchas and confusing aspects that you **will** smash your head into. Writing operations is not like writing normal Ruby classes.
* For some reason **Operations** **do not tell you which step failed. WTF.**
* Which keys operation steps store values in are poorly documented, and the result object is extremely difficult to inspect.
* Using the full Trailblazer architecture for CRUD takes forever. Don't do it unless you need to.
* The cells API has lots of gotchas. I gave up on it.
* Quality of maintenance is not as high as mainstream Rails code.
* Quality if documentation is not as high as mainstream Rails code.
* I'm not interested in diatribes, no one architecture can rule them all.
* Major bugs with **requiring** pieces of my concepts tree from other pieces. Almost every shared module I had to give some kind of a workaround name and directory so it wouldn't get overwritten by the Rails autoloader or god knows what.

**Cells:**

* Nice idea, clean. ActionView eventually creates a mess.

ProgramAllTheThings,"I'm currently going through this right now. I used webpacker. It's been an interesting experiment, but I wouldn't recommend it. I will be separating it into a Rails API and a separate Node / React frontend.

Webpacker is just really fragile and it puts you into dependency hell. Rails ""supports"" modern frontends in name only, in my opinion; they don't *really* fit into the framework, and you end up with this unnatural coupling. It feels like you're building two separate apps anyway - you might as well make it true - each part will be easier to manage individually.

> Is using React (or any other front end framework) always the right choice for a Rails app? Or are there times where I should just stick to the default view templates and erb?

If you need an interactive front-end, use a frontend framework. Complex projects need frameworks, but simple apps don't necessarily need it. That said, frontend frameworks do seem designed to make growth easier. But a pure Rails app is way faster to get off the ground.

> How do I handle authentication with devise if I use React?

I'm not using devise, but my setup is pretty similar. You'll authenticate with calls to the api from the frontend; it's not really that difficult, Rails still provides its cookie magic.

zenzen_wakarimasen,"I am currently using Rails and React with Webpack and works like a charm.

One of the main advantatges is that, as you have all the code together, you don't need to think about versioning the API.

Things to take into account:

- For authentication, I use the normal Devise views. Once the users get the cookie, `axios` will use it. I have an Axios interceptor that, when it detects a `401` response, reloads the page, so Devise takes over.

- CSRF token. You just need to configure Axios, so it adds it to the headers.

> Is using React (or any other front end framework) always the right choice for a Rails app? Or are there times where I should just stick to the default view templates and erb?

React is not worth it unless you are building a consumer app with a lot of interactivity and you have good people doing front-end.

The app we are building, we have two sides. The user's side, and the agents side (internal). I really thing that we should have built the internal part using only Rails ERB. Our velocity would be much higher and we would have less bugs.

AndrewAtBrisaBoards,"I love Rails, but I really don't like the idea of tightly coupling 2 apps that are so separate. So I just build my frontends separately. If, for any reason, I decided to switch away from Rails, my frontend is ready for whatever framework I want.

&#x200B;

For the app I'm working on now, I'm using poi (I think this is more for Vue than React, but not 100% sure) and hacked an option to specify the API backend. It makes even more sense for me, because I built a fake backend using IndexedDB (all data is stored in the browser), so if I don't specify a backend URL, it defaults to idb.

&#x200B;

\*\*edit\*\*

And to answer some of your other questions:

&#x200B;

\- A frontend framework isn't necessarily always the best choice. For example, getting a site indexed with frontend frameworks is a PITA, and it adds quite a lot of complexity to new projects. But, obviously, there are a lot of benefits to having a SPA experience.

\- Looks like it's pretty easy to use devise with React: [https://medium.com/@iamjane/devise-with-react-webpacker-and-rails-dacbf9ae0233](https://medium.com/@iamjane/devise-with-react-webpacker-and-rails-dacbf9ae0233)

\- I've built a few apps where I just used cookies for auth. So the login page wasn't part of the SPA, and once they were logged in, I redirected to the SPA. I had to expose the authenticity\_token that Rails provides for non-GET requests and add it to backend API calls.",1537853345.0
jordanaustino,"Short answer, no there is no right way. I would likely look at using webpacker though, or I might consider just keeping them as separate apps in seperate although this requires more infrastructure setup, deploying your front end is pretty cheap and simple in comparison to the API. 

To your other questions:

Personally I lean towards front end frameworks as I prefer the seperation of front and backend concerns but that doesn't make it correct. Especially for lightweight apps using Rails views can make sense and lots of places successfully deploy production apps at scale this way. There are tradeoffs both ways you go.
 
For authentication IIRC this is one shortcoming with Devise. I've personally Ally used knock which requires some of your own custom building around for instance forgotten passwords and sign up, not ideal. There is also devise-jwt although I'm not particularly well versed in it.

Then one thing I can think of you might need to be concerned about is if you need SSR, Ive heard this can be done with react rails but I haven't done it personally and it sounds like it has some gotchas.

You will find varied opinions on this but I think everyone will agree it's not *always* the right choice. 

Personally, I think 90% of apps that use a JS frontend don't really need it. You can do a lot of responsiveness just with UJS and turbolinks in a rails app, and avoid many of the drawbacks of a js frontend. But there are many who will disagree.

As for how I personally would keep the frontend and backend completely separate.

Technology choices are driven mostly by fashion and in the case of most SPAs I saw it was a bad architectural decision.

You need to start with a problem statement and work backwards towards a solution, not the other way round. If what you're trying to do is simpler to do with React + Rails then go for it. If ERB is simpler then that's your choice. Remember it's a spectrum and there's nothing preventing you from using React for a dozen of highly-interactive controls (Facebook started React when working on chat).

SnarkyNinja,"First piece of advice is to extract what appears to be a fairly complicated piece of logic out of your model and into a dedicated query object. You can then write tests for the query itself in isolation from your actual models. Here's a quick-start.

    # app/queries/conflicting_events_query.rb

    class ConflictingEventsQuery < ApplicationQuery
      def initialize(user, event)
        @user = user
        @event = event

      def relation

As to your specific issue. I think you are making it more complex than it needs to be. Since we know the time frame of the event we are checking, we only need to know one of two things: if an event call time or end time in that event's time frame. So you can do two queries that will check those two things with `Event.where(call: time_frame).or(Event.where(end: time_frame))`

Expect to receive will set a watcher on the method and then when you call the controller method which calls the method you're expecting it will recognize that the method is called.

Your troubles are happening because you are nesting your user routes in your project routes and this is almost always a bad design as it doesn't reveal the intention of your website/application design

You should mostly keep your routes as reflections of your database design to make it easy to work with ...

Users do not always belong to a certain project, they might work on more than one project & nesting your user resource inside your project resource is going to cause you to write a lot of extra code to overcome that poor decision.

You should instead setup users & projects as their own resources and then route from there.

Use a form object. Include active model valuations so that you can easily represent errors in the front end. You can have one custom validation to check if the user can perform the action and another to check if the car can be destroyed. 

I’d throw in a form object almost right away when it involves logic between more than one active record model, unless it’s just nested attributes.

Also, you can move the logic to check if the car can be destroyed to the form object. Chances are, this piece of logic won’t be used by any other parts of the app and putting it in the model contributes to the fat model problem over time, increasing cognitive load when reading the models, which are effectively global.

After digging around a little more, it looks like what I was looking for was an SQL INTERSECT query. Unfortunately this type of query isn't implemented in ActiveRecord. So I had to build the query myself, using the following StackOverflow posts as a guide:

https://stackoverflow.com/a/33558154
https://stackoverflow.com/a/11299725

    def self.find_with_all_tags(search_tags)
          intersect_query = """"
          search_tags.each_with_index do |tag_id, i|
            return nil unless tag_id.is_a? Integer # will this actually thwart any sort of injection attack?
            intersect_query += ""SELECT activity_id FROM taggings WHERE tag_id = ?""
            intersect_query += "" INTERSECT "" if i != search_tags.length - 1
          end
        activity_array = []
        Tagging.find_by_sql([intersect_query, *search_tags]).each do |tagging|
          activity_array << tagging.activity
        end
    activity_array
    end

I'm sure there's a lot lacking in my knowledge of Ruby or SQL, but I'm able to build an SQL query that does a proper AND query with the tags. The query could get out of hand if too many tags are specified, but at present I don't anticipate more than about 150 or 200 on the live site.

I wonder why ActiveRecord doesn't support INTERSECT queries. Is it considered poor data modeling to rely on them? Are they fairly obscure as far as SQL goes? I don't know much about NoSQL databases, but is this a sort of query that would work better with them?",1537681268.0

LeastProfessional,"I would create a 'Dropdown' model where the users could add, edit, update, and destroy certain links and assign those links to  They could do this a number of ways, you could either add a new model called 'Dropdown links' or something and set the relationships between the Dropdown and Dropdown links like this.

Dropdown.rb

`class Dropdown < ApplicationRecord`

`has_and_belongs_to_many :dropdown_links`

Dropdown\_link.rb

`class Dropdown < ApplicationRecord`

`has_and_belongs_to_many :dropdowns`

Now you can do Dropdown.dropdown\_links which will return all the 'Dropdown links' referring to that dropdown in which you could just loop through them in the view! You will need to assign this dropdown somehow to page or link somehow through a page model of some sort. Remember, this is just one way that you could do it and theres a ton of different ways of doing it!

cmd-t,"Some advice:

>The replacement cost of the new app is $40k upfront costs w/ $10k per yr for maintenance, neither of which are acceptable for our size organization and budget. Since it's a simple CRUD app and not really that difficult to build I figure this will be a good opportunity to build upon my knowledge and experience in web development. So there's the background.

You understand that you'll now be responsible for something someone else quoted 40k + 10k y.o.y. for? And that you told people you could build it for cheaper, and that you are going to do it using technology that you aren't really familiar with? You are gonna have a bad time and you should not take this responsibility upon yourself. If you can, make sure people know that you are just trying, that you will take no responsibility for the code and that you won't be able to maintain it unless you get specific hours to do so.

Other than that, you got some pretty good advice already on how to do it. The problem is that you haven't told us *what* the dropdown choices are, which makes it hard to model your domain objects. This is the first thing you should be doing.

You seem to have some sort of 'Category', I guess it's something like a sedan or a truck. That is a great first object to model.

    class Category < ApplicationRecord
    end

Next, we have Ford, Chevy, etc. This is clearly a Brand. Why not model that as well, we might only have a subset of all available brands, which might even change. And other domain objects are probably related to the Brand.

    class Brand < ApplicationRecord
    end

Now, is there a relation between your Category and Brand? I don't know. I can imagine there is. Some categories might have a subsection of al brands. That means there is a n-to-n relationship between brands and categories. This is called a many\_to\_many relationship in rails. Does every Category 'have' every Brand? Then there is really no real relationship between the two. I can't really tell from what you showed here, but I'm pretty sure they are determined by the current available models.

Next, your Model definitely belongs to a brand. I think it also might belong to a certain category, since a Model might be a hatchback or station wagon. In that case, we have the following. I'm gonna call Model Make, because I get confused talking about Model models.

    class Make < ApplicationRecord
      belongs_to :brand
      belongs_to :category
    end
    
    class Brand < ApplicationRecord
      has_many :models
    end
    
    class Category < ApplicationRecord
      has_many :makes
      has_many :brands, -> { distinct }, through: :makes
    end

Now you just need three controllers. One for each model. You can then easily fill a dropdown with something like

    # controller
    @category = Category.find params[:category_id] # I have no idea, but somehow you get the category.
    
    # view
    <% @category.brands.each do |brand| %>
      <%= brand.name %>
      <% @brand.makes.where(category: @category).each do |make| %>
        <%= make.name %>
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

bulldog_in_the_dream,"I'm in a similar situation. Played around with Rails about 4-5 years ago. After that I've worked primarily as a frontend dev with Angular and React on large projects where frontend and backend have been separated.

Now I'm looking at Rails again since I think the above approach is overkill for personal projects (and overused in general). So far I have only been toying with Turbolinks, but from what I can see it's really well integrated in Rails. For instance, doing form POSTs, DELETEs etc. with redirect also have Turbolinks support. That would require a certain setup in Django and also the addition of middelware to handle redirects. In Rails it basically comes out of the box. Very nice!

With the webpacker you have in modern Rails it's also trivial to add e.g. a React component to a page. So far, just from playing around, I've found that Turbolinks and sprinkels of React works out fine together, and gives that responsive SPA feel without going all the way. Maybe it's because I haven't been bitten by anything yet, but so far I'm really liking what I see!

BaconGlock,"Here's the django middleware you need: https://stackoverflow.com/a/48273733/523051 i'm the OP of that question.

My relatable story: I have been doing frontend/static webdev for many years and finally committed to learning programming/backend stuff and went through, what at the time was one of the only classes available there, a udacity.com course for beginner python. I made it thru and, shortly after, Steve Huffman (reddit founder) started a udacity course for webdev and it was...mindblowing. He was teaching with google app engine and by the time i got through it i knew everything i needed to get started building my [great app idea]. Flask was just starting to pick up steam and was very similar to the GAE I was fairly familiar with so i ran with it. Slowly but surely and piece by painstaking piece, i built up from a single file to a solid and well thought out folder system of my own thinking, blueprints, jinja, sqlalchemy, memcache, redis, handmade login system using bcrypt, etc etc. the whole nine yards. It was a pretty advanced setup towards the end now that i think of it but i was finding that i was spending way too much time having to do basically everything from scratch, and this began my journey for something better.

The obvious first step was django. It all made sense, in theory,  and i immediately loved how much less effort it took to get something going than with flask. Everything was plug-and-play with existing modules and at first it was looking like this was my new love. But things quickly turned sour when i found that there were roadblocks everywhere i turned that i either had to spend days working through why it wasn't working like i wanted and/or accept defeat and just live with all these things that just bothered me how it needed to be done. Rails was something i'd been looking at for awhile and honestly, turbolinks was the major draw for me. All these DHH proclamations about it being the secret sauce for a single/small team developer to be able to do phone apps using turbolinks with the same web code was just so crazy enthralling that i couldn't help but be upset i was missing out on that opportunity. But ruby was so mindblowing to me that i just couldnt wrap my head around it. With python you import all your functions into the file you want to use them in and this is how i learned and knew to read and follow code. With rails, ~everything is auto-imported so trying to make sense of any code i looked at made zero sense to me and i didnt want to spend the time to figure it out. This lead to me trying to get turbolinks working with django which led to that SO post/answer. I did get it to work but there was just too much other django bullshit to keep me content.

I ultimately decided to just commit to learning ruby/rails and i went on a tear where i just set python down for awhile and jumped in with both feet to the ruby world and slowly but surely, it clicked more and more. Once i completed THE rails tutorial, it was blindingly clear: rails was everything I ever wanted in a web framework. I consider and proclaim it to be god's gift to a solo webdev. Everything is so magnificently well thought out, optimized, and cohesive to ensure the ruby philosophy of ""programmer happiness"" is well represented. Everything about it makes sense to me. Everything about it is as painless as can be and i can do things with a single command line that would take me hours/days/week to hook up and connect all the wires by myself with flask. Even the function importing from python i now find to be just an unnecessary time spender. With rails i can spend 5 minutes typing command lines and boom, i have ultra solid web app with login system ready and waiting for me to code in my real functionality. Try that with django. And now i have turbolinks too.

IMO, django/flask are for the people that love to program and tinker with things and do all the research and get everything just right by handcrafting everything along the way. I used to be one of those people. But at some point i realized ""i just want to get some shit done and launch something."" Those are the people rails is for. It's a productivity dream come true and i think everyone should give it a real chance and try to do something substantial with it before dismissing it. If you can let go of your needing to define and control every tiny aspect, then there is a paradise waiting for you where all the basic stuff that really doesn't matter have been taken care of for you and you can get going making some real headway on the actually important stuff.

mrfrosti,"Heads up - your `valid` attribute is likely going to raise a `DangerousAttributeError`. Might be best to rename his column to something like `is_valid`:
```
ActiveRecord::DangerousAttributeError (valid? is defined by Active Record. Check to make sure that you don't have an attribute or method with the same name.)
```

Now to your question: There are a few ways to do this. As @ac1234567 mentions, you could do a `distinct` provided that the rows are truly unique (all column values are distinct in the returned rows). Since the id is distinct, we could omit this from our select:
```
Post.select(:is_valid, :user_id).distinct
```
This however does not retrieve the id, making the record pretty difficult to work with since you need the id to update/delete.

A better approach might be to use group by. Depending on your database and version, you might be able to get away with:
```
Post.group(:user_id)
```
This is considered non-deterministic however because we haven't specified in the query _which_ row to keep, and which to drop resulting in ambiguity, and unpredictable behavior. SQLite, and MySQL lets you get away with it, but PostgreSQL will not. To fix the ambiguity, we need to specify _which_ record to keep by using an aggregate on any columns that aren't in the group by. We can use max (maximum in some databases) to specify we want to keep the one with the higher id:
```
Post.select(""max(id) as id"").group(:user_id)
```
You could also use `min(id) as id` if you wanted to keep the lower record `id`. This query again excludes columns from the select. If you needed the user_id, we have to explicitly include this in the select:
```
Post.select(""max(id) as id, user_id"").group(:user_id)
```
Notice that we are able to specify `user_id` without an aggregate. This is because it is specified in the `group by` clause.

Honestly I'm probably better at answering questions, considering my app isn't a personal pet project anymore, but it's still my baby, even if she's ""off the grid"".

I can speak to end-to-end product development, how we formed the business and went legitimate, hurdles we encountered along the way, costs of transitioning from pet-project to real-world application.

The idea of StatJacks happened almost 2 years ago, and code really ramped up 1 year ago, we almost launched in time for MLB 2018, but delayed until NFL 2018.  It's been one heck of a ride!

The app is self funded, just paying monthly bills to keep the lights on; Google domains, AWS, Github, ngrok, and a few paid assets (images/videos).  Startup costs aside, the whole thing costs about $50/mo to run.

Mostly you just pass props into the component via data attributes in the DOM. Or if you’re doing an SPA, you’ll just be using Rails as the API.

And now that Rails uses webpack as its asset pipeline, including React should be way easier than it used to be.

ProgramAllTheThings,"I'm currently working on a React/Redux on Ruby on Rails app. I've had several years of Rails experience, but just picked up React recently and this is my first personal project with it (outside of those done for class).

My experience so far has been pretty good, but not because it's been really easy. Webpacker makes it possible to use them together, and it works fine, but there were a few gotchas along the way. It really feels like I'm building two separate apps at once - one being a Rails API, and another being a React app that connects to it. The nice thing about it is that I'm able to use one repo instead of two, and I can run all of my tests from one repo (and have circleci do the same). I'm not really sure this is worth the increased complexity. Probably isn't, no sane person should do this.

Routing was annoying to get working. I'm basically only rendering a single html page and various json routes from the Rails app and using React Router to handle everything. Effectively a SPA. I have an api call that goes out when the React app is first loaded to check authentication status and reroute accordingly.

However, I worry about the fragile nature of this unholy union and webpacker, especially given that there's seemingly a new vulnerability alert every other week for some dependency of a dependency of webpacker.

Another issue is that there really isn't that much in terms of resources about using React on Rails on the internet. Here are a few blog post I have found valuable along the way:

https://x-team.com/blog/get-in-full-stack-shape-with-rails-5-1-webpacker-and-reactjs/

Tricky question!
Your problem has nothing to do with routes, but /u/XDLMA0 was on the right track. You're using the HTTP verb `PATCH` to ""complete a list item"".

This particular short-hand method, requires Rails UJS to be working. Even though Rails 5.2 includes UJS by default, it still uses the asset pipeline to be included:

https://github.com/mirzaciulian/todo/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/application.js#L13

If you look at your browser console, you'll see a JS error that there's an `unexpected =`. This is because The asset pipeline syntax for inclusion is actually a JS comment:

```
//= require rails-ujs
```
is the CORRECT syntax for including other JS files, even though that looks like (to most syntax highlighters) a comment -- it's actually valid code.

So basically put `//` on lines 13-15 of `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`, and your JS will be included properly.

Basically, your sidekiq image will look exactly like the image you use for the main rails app (you can just even use the same one), but the `CMD` will be something like `CMD bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml` instead of starting the rails server (e.g. `CMD bundle exec rails s -p 3000 -b '0.0.0.0'`).

I won't get into the intricacies of how to actually scale the containers up & down as that is highly dependent on how you have them deployed (e.g. using `docker-compose`, `docker swarm`, `kubernetes`, etc...). But, a simple example (using docker swarm) would be setting up a cronjob that runs a rake task that checks the sidekiq queue size, and if it's above some threshold scale the containers up, and below scale them down:

    # tasks/sidekiq.rake
    namespace :sidekiq do
      task scale: environment do
        if Sidekiq::Queue.all.map(&:size).sum > 5000
          # if the queue size is greater than 5000 have
          # 5 sidekiq containers running
          system ""docker"", ""service"", ""scale"", ""sidekiq=5""
        else
          # otherwise only have 2 running
          system ""docker"", ""service"", ""scale"", ""sidekiq=2""

I wouldn't be too concerned about pulling the actual rails auto-generated session identifier, add something to the session that you have control over.

It is usually combined with something like this in your controller (assuming your user has set a timezone):

```
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
around_action :set_time_zone, if: :current_user

private

def set_time_zone(&block)
  Time.use_zone(current_user.time_zone, &block)

gaffneyc,"We did exactly this on [Dead Man's Snitch](https://deadmanssnitch.com) a year or two ago. I would say the technical side was the easiest part of it since we ended up doing a top to bottom review of the app to make sure everything made sense in a new team / project sense. Reimagining the app as being Project based took the most work to get right.

​

From a high level technical perspective we created a new Project for each User that used User#name as the name of the Project. We then associated the User with the Project as an admin and migrated and shared resources to the Project. We updated all of our routes to be namespaced by Project (we call them Cases but since \`case\` is reserved it caused all kinds of hassle), for example \`/snitches\` because \`/cases/:id/snitches\`. We added legacy routes for existing bookmarks / emails to redirect to the new  URL. I would avoid trying to reuse User IDs for your Team IDs if you can get away with it since it can get really tricky.

​

Since we moved most resources to Project we added  \`current\_project\` to our ApplicationController that acts similarly to \`current\_user\`. For the most part we were able to do a search and replace to update most of our controllers.

​

I would recommend having some sort of intro or drip the first time customers log in to encourage them to update the team name. Also, we do all of our data migrations in raw SQL which meant the actual migration took all of a minute, try to avoid migrating with Rails models since it can cause downtime.

Are you saying you'd like for a field to be optional, but if it is filled out, it needs to follow a certain convention? If so, you're looking for [conditional validation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#conditional-validation). Note that you can use this conditional validation to validate other fields as well, so ""don't validate 'field a' unless 'field b' is present"" is a use-case of conditional validation.",1535575080.0
SureLetsDoAnother,"Awesome! Welcome to crafting software!

Your form fields are getting marked as ""readonly"" after a failed validation because the failed value still exists for that attribute even though it wasn't saved to the DB. That's important because your view is using an object that was *initially* built from what is in the DB. Once the validation fails you're displaying the same view again, using the same object. Only this time your object doesn't perfectly match what's in the DB. It's values have been updated, but since they failed validation they weren't persisted. The problem is that the ""readonly if a value is present"" logic won't filter out values that are invalid, because it doesn't know anything about that.

Depending on how deep your are into Ruby on Rails, the advice I'm about to give might seem really weird.

I'm going to assume your form is for editing an instance of a `StolenGun` record, but it could be anything. A lot of tutorials and guides would have you do something like this in your `StolenGunsController#edit` action.

    def edit
      @stolen_gun = StolenGun.find(params[:id])
      render :edit
    end

That's really good for tutorials, and for some real situations, because there's no needless complications. Your `edit.html.erb` will probably have a relatively simple form with fields that correspond directly to the attributes of your record. It's usually best to keep it simple.

So to keep it simple I'd suggest moving past the basic controller example, and start making an object specifically for your form.

It could keep track of which attributes to display as read only, which will probably be important when you want to add editing abilities to admins.

 Like this:

    def edit
      # I'm going to assume you have a current_user helper method or something similar
      @stolen_gun_form = StolenGunFormObject.new(params[:id], current_user)
      render :edit
    end

The class would look something like this:

    class StolenGunFormObject
      attr_accessor :stolen_gun, :readonly_fields

      def initialize(stolen_gun_id, current_user, readonly_fields_list = nil)
        @stolen_gun = StolenGun.find(stolen_gun_id)
        @readonly_fields = readonly_fields_list || build_read_only_fields_list_for_user(current_user)
      end

      private

      def build_read_only_fields_list_for_user(current_user)
        # If the current user is an admin, then just a hash which defaults key values to false (meaning they are not readonly)
        return Hash.new(false) if current_user.admin?
        attributes_with_values = @stolen_gun.attributes.select { |key, value| value.present }
        attributes_with_values.transform_values { |value| true }
      end
    end
    

This may seem like a crazy amount of extra work, but it'll almost certainly be worth it if you have to start getting particular with who's allowed to edit which fields and when.

Let's go through an example with a form. I don't know exactly what your form looks like, so here's a basic one.

    <%= form_for(@stolen_gun_form.stolen_gun ) do |f| %>
      <%= f.label :case_number %>
      <%= f.text_field :case_number, readonly: @stolen_gun_form.readonly_fields[:case_number] %>

      <%= f.label :case_worker %>
      <%= f.text_field :case_worker, @stolen_gun_form.readonly_fields[:case_worker]%>

      <%= f.label :owner_name %>
      <%= f.text_field :owner_name, @stolen_gun_form.readonly_fields[:owner_name] %>

      <%= f.label :serial_number, @stolen_gun_form.readonly_fields[:serial_number] %>
      <%= f.text_field :serial_number  %>

      <%= f.submit ""Save changes"" %>
    <% end %>

Typing out `@stolen_gun_form.readonly_fields[:case_number]` and the like gets repetitive, so in real life you'd clean it up a bit. 

There are two nice benefits to this seemingly extra work. Just like before, your view will be re-rendered with the same object and its potentially invalid attributes. However, that won't matter because you set the list of readonly fields when you created the object, so the original readonly fields will remain no matter how many attempts the user needs to get something right.

Secondly, you won't have to change the view's code in response to changes in how readonly fields should be determined. Your view doesn't care if it's super complicated to figure it out, and it doesn't need to know how to do it. All it needs to know is that it can check its form object for what it needs to know. Somewhere else in the code can be responsible for figuring out that stuff.

Speaking of which...

I actually don't like a `before_update` callback for this. The logic would run every time the record is updated, whether you expect it to or not. If anything else needs to update these records, the `before_update` then something is going to have to tell `before_update` that it's okay to do so. It'd probably be simpler to have something else figure out what to send to the record for updating, instead of having it figure out which of the given attributes it is supposed to allow. That way every situation that has to update the record can be responsible (on its own) for figuring out what to update, and then just tells the thing to do so.

This is basically the reasoning behind strong parameters in Rails, and the reason why things like model-level attribute protection has been removed.

And for most situations like you've described, you'd probably want to do just that, using `ActionController::Parameters` to create an allowlist for only the things you want to get through. If that sounds pretty similar to what we just did with the `readonly_fields` then you're on a good path. They're probably pretty closely related, and might just be an inverse of one another.

That would mean that you might have a single class responsible for giving you a list to use for something like `readonly_fields`, and another list of for permitted parameters to update, both derived from the full attributes list for `stolen_gun` and whoever the `current_user` is. You could move all the logic for list building out of the other classes and into it.

That way crazy changes to your permissions will only change your list builder class logic. `StolenGunsController`, `StolenGunFormObject`, and `edit.html.erb` won't have to change when permissions change.

For example:

Admins can edit everything, but they're tired of having to fix mistakes for people. It's time to give department heads the ability to edit.

Now department heads can edit everything, but there's no way they're doing someone else's paperwork. Team leads need the ability to edit all attributes on a form, *but only when the record was created by one of their direct reports.*

If you do it right, you'll never have to think about (or make changes to) your controller, model, form object, or view.


Good luck!

P.S. Don't overthink ""doing it right."" Ideally you make it ""just right enough"" to keep going without overspending your time. Exactly what ""just right enough"" actually means is often impossible to say in the moment. You'll get a better feel for it over the years.
",1535594794.0
TerminalVector,I would use a before_update callback to run a method before each record is saved. Then in that method you can call .changes on the object to see what changes were made by the user and raise an error if they shouldn't be allowed. Then you make the fields read-only (if they are set) in your view using erb. If you look at the rails docs on controller callbacks it'll give you something to go on. ,1535580336.0

Idk what this converts to outside of the magic unicorn land, but the data is out there if you want to get a rough idea.

You should expect equity to add about another 50-100% of your salary.  So make sure this is a place you'll be happy and will do well.

After you've been working for a few years, education is less relevant.  But most places will also pay for classes and conferences.

The only difference I see in boot camp or self taught developers vs traditional school or masters is that the higher education leans to solving crazier problems in novel ways.  But that's a gross generalization.

We (the industry) are moving more towards concepts like fair offer where we give a more objective level based comp based on experience and market research.  Negotiation overwhelmingly favors certain groups and disfavors everyone else.

Negotiation tips: you can almost always just ask for $5-10k more and get it.  Sometimes they'll balk, so you can ask for a signing bonus instead.  You're a direct apply so they saved a shitload on sourcing or relocation.  Sourcing can cost 25-100% of a year's salary.  Really.

If for some reason they're holding out on money, you can almost always just ask for more vacation days if they're still not doing unlimited.  Sometimes they'll say no to $5k but not blink to two more weeks PTO which is actually more 🤷.  Salary is usually the hardest thing to get when joining, there are lots of things you can ask for instead.

If they say ""oh we'll give you a raise in 6 months depending on how you do.. "" most of the time that doesn't pan out for a lot of reasons.

xionon,"What you want is whats known as a ""has many through"" relationship

So imagine you have two tables to start:

    characters
    id | name

    items
    id | name

You want characters to have items, but you don't want 100 copies of `broadsword` in your database. What you need is a table in between the two of them, helping you calculate a user's inventory.

    characters
    id | name

    character_items
    id | character_id | item_id

    items
    id | name

So, when `Character(id=1, name=""bob"")` gets access to a new item `Item(id=1, name=""broadsword"")`, you create a new `CharacterItem(character_id=1, item_id=1)`

Here's the relevant documentation, which will do a better job of explaining than me: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#choosing-between-has-many-through-and-has-and-belongs-to-many",1535164106.0
SureLetsDoAnother,">IE: So and So user has X,Y,Z items (Sword/Shield/Axe whatever...) and also has X,Y,Z skills. I guess i'd just do a normal has_many relationship right? is there a more intelligent way?

There might be.

The [has_many :through](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#the-has-many-through-association) (or the similar has_one :through) association is useful for situations that might be like yours.

In your scenario, a character would have`item_list` models, which would itself have many `item` models. This may not seem immediately relevant, but the third model provides you with more than a simple `has_many`.

Since `item_list` is it's own model, it'll have its own attributes and validations. As a basic example, the `item_list` could be assigned a name. You could do more though.

If characters should only be allowed a one a certain item at time, you could validate that relatively easily this way. It'd be slightly awkward to have to do it from the character. 

You could limit the number of total items in a list. You could limit the total weight of items in a list. You could make the total allowed weight in the list an attribute of the list, and update it in response to a character statistics. If it updates to be lower than the current total weight than you drop items from the list.

>Secondly:

> What's the best way to be able to ""Save"" multiple items to a user? IE: ideally the user could type in a name of something (lets say an item) and add it to a list, and then continue to add them (Sort of like a dropdown that lets you select multiple options). Im not really sure what this is called? A Multiselect or something? How are these saved and created as Inputs? (Since this is better than adding one at a time)

It depends.

Are the items already created somewhere, and the user is just adding them to their character's item list?

If so, then you have several ways to go about this, but you're probably looking for something like the [<datalist>](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/creating-autocomplete-dropdowns-datalist-element) element.

You'd populate the values with the names of the items already in your database.

If the items are not created, then you'd need to allow the form for the item list to [accept nested attributes](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/NestedAttributes/ClassMethods.html) for items. This will allow users to create items for the item list *as* they create the item list.

Either way, you'll end up with a way to add a single item to an item list (either by selecting existing or creating new ones).

But you wanted to add multiple at once, and that's going to require a bit of javascript.

There are a few ways of doing this, and a quick bit of googling will lead you to several decent ones. Basically, you'll have a button or link for 'Add Another Item' that triggers a bit of javascript, which adds another instance of your single item fields.

Do you mean visiting the web app using a mobile browser? No, it's not a bad idea. Especially for something simple like this.

Sidekiq allows higher concurrency through multithreading for whenever you need it. If you compare the issues, pulls, and changelog on each project, you’ll see that Sidekiq is very well maintained. Its maintainers (especially, Mike Perham) are very keen on shedding dependencies and not polluting all objects with its interface. It also has a pro version with some nice bells and whistles.

Basically if it's in the model where you want to do it it's ok to have something in app/models, but it's good to move these kind of operations outside of model, to avoid creating fat models.   


Also models should only be concerned with validation and querying/state changing logic, not to mention that you would want to do your image processing somewhere in the background, within a job on a Sidekiq/Resque/DelayedJob worker, which is another reason to hide that logic from the model, and encapsulate it within a service",1534868390.0

Note: all of my models have a `jsonb` field named `data` to manage most of their ... data. Image urls are stored as an array of strings in `data['images']`:

    # model.rb
    class [Model] < ApplicationRecord
      include Imageable

      def self.data_attributes
        {
          ...

          data = [resource.data](https://resource.data)
          data\[""images""\] = resource.images.concat(params.require(:images))
          [resource.data](https://resource.data) = data
          [resource.save](https://resource.save)!
          head :ok

You then `include Imageable` in any model that needs to manage images.

I'm also using `ActiveAdmin` so I `include Imageable::Admin` in `app/admin/[model].rb`. That creates the action items and endpoints to upload images.

Test with Rspec:

    # spec/models/concerns/[model].rb
    require 'rails_helper'

    RSpec.shared_examples 'imageable' do |parameter|
      let(:model) { create(described_class.to_s.underscore) }

It does make it a pain to include the `shared_examples`:


    # spec/models/[model]_spec.rb
    require 'rails_helper'
    require Rails.root.join('spec/models/concerns/imageable')

jaryl,"If your code is specific to your application then it should firstly be somewhere within the app folder. If your code makes use of say your images or user model then it is specific to your application and shouldn’t be in the lib folder. 

Within the app folder, you could create a folder such as services, and park it there. For projects I work on we typically have a lot more folders, such as decorators, presenters, form objects, etc. If you establish a set of guidelines as to what goes into those folders, then it makes a lot of sense to group by convention. 

Otherwise, you can still put it under the standard models folder. Even if there is no ActiveRecord code, it still models some sort of behaviour or entity, and thus it is not a wrong place to put things; for e.g, a form object is merely a model of a form.

I’d only worry about creating a folder if I am having a lot of models that have a similar implementation, such that I can label them that I start moving them into their own folder.",1534876208.0

OtavioHenrique,"It depends of what you learned or prefer, I think everybody follow one pattern that they prefer or company/project use. 

In general, we've three choices:
- models/
- services/
- lib/

At my current work, we use a pattern that I like:

- At `models/` If we have an PORO that have business logic of a persisted object (Rails Model), we create a folder with the name of these model and put this PORO inside it.

Example (only for example):
```
models/
├── document/
│   ├── document_validator.rb
|   ├── document_downloader.rb 
├── document.rb
```

```ruby
module Document
  class DocumentValidator
  end
end
```

- At `lib/` we put more generic POROS, that all the project can use, usually we put integration classes, for example:

```
lib/
├── amazon_s3_downloader.rb
```
(All the project may use AmazonS3Downloader)

- At `services/` we put classes the sounds more like ""services"" that really do a service, and don't belongs to specific model logic, like `event_hub_service.rb` that put events at our Kinesis, or our A/B test service.

Randy_Watson,"If this has nothing to do with the database, where are the practice pairs being generated from? It sounds like what you are doing is better served purely on the frontend and you might be overcomplicating this. 

Let me step back a second and walk you through the data flow in rails. Imagine we have a **Foo** model and its views and controllers. The controller maps CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) actions. These actions are just ruby methods in the controllers that are associated with a route in the routes file. For example:

    https://myrailsapp.com/foo/new

This would map to the **FooController** new method. When the rails server sees this, it executes whatever methods exist inside the method and then looks for the view file. The view files is then returned to the browser. 

    https://myrailsapp.com/foo/index
    https://myrailsapp.com/foo/1

In the above routes, the first one would call the index method and return the index view. The second method would do a database lookup of the **Foo** model with an id of 1. If it finds it, it returns the show view with the specified model. 

This is the convention over configuration part. However, you are not calling your database so there are several ways you could accomplish what you are trying to do.

1. Have a single controller method that has the practice pair. Use javascript to create your messages and user interaction.

2. Use view helper methods and Javascript to work with your practice pairs.

3. **Not recommended**: Use view logic.

4. **Not recommended**: Pass variables between controllers in your view. 

I'll tell you how to do number four, but I really think you should be doing this on the client side. In your view, you can pass information to a different controller as follows:

    <%= link_to ""Controller2""
        :controller => ""controller_2"", 
        :action => ""update"", 
        :pair => @pair %>

That would create a link that passes @pair to the update action of controller 2. You would actually have to set the variable first, otherwise it's just nil.

That all being said, I really think you should look at setting this up client side if you are not dealing with the database.",1534806558.0
ethboy2000,"If the pairs are pretty simple pieces of text, instead of rendering your ‘controller1’ new template from ‘controller1’ create, you could redirect to the ‘controller1’ new action instead and pass the pairs as query string parameters.

2. It stores your pairs in the query string. Otherwise, where else is it supposed to persist this data without getting really complicated? That way, when you hit back, you’re actually going back to /new?pair1=bob,julie etc. instead of a blank new template.",1534837153.0

If you have existing infrastructure in place and/or don't want to manage integrations with these very large libraries (ActiveAdmin can be a bit of a pain to keep up with over the years) then writing something custom might be a better solution.

Herpiles,"I had the exact same issue setting multiple attributes using Rail's store to write to a jsonb field. Rails unfortunately stringifies and escapes stored JSON and makes each attribute not queryable. For example, the following using `store` creates the undesired, stringified stored jsonb field. [It seems to be a regression related to how a default value is set on a jsonb field.](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/25594)

`
    store :jsonb_field,
            accessors: %i[attribute_1, attribute_2], coder: JSON
`


Turns out, Rails 5 attribute API does not stringify stored JSON, and you can tuck this behavior away nicely into a concern if you still experience this behavior.

    # frozen_string_literal: true

    module Accessors
      extend ActiveSupport::Concern

      class_methods do
        def has_accessors_for(field, *accessors)
          attribute field, :json

          accessors.flatten.each do |accessor|
            # create getters/setters on the given jsonb field for each attribute
            define_method(""#{accessor}="") do |val|
              self[field] ||= {}
              self[field][accessor.to_s] = val
            end

            define_method(accessor) do
              self[field] ||= {}
              self[field][accessor.to_s]
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end


You can then very easily mimic the behavior of `store` in any model without stringifying JSON with:

`
has_accessors_for :jsonb_field,
                           %i[attribute_1, attribute_2]

brainbag,"I started professionally developing more than 20 years ago; I've also taught many classes, and hired a lot of people for development roles, including in Rails. When I'm hiring someone, I care a *lot* more about whether they're a good developer than what language or framework they know. 

Unless I'm hiring for a serious senior position, the most I expect of a developer is to have a basic understanding of how Rails works, and how it can be refactored. Basically, what I care about is whether they can come up with solutions to programming problems (which are pretty much the same in any language) more than what language they can do it in.  

For example, I might ask a few questions about how the backend cycle works in Rails (request to response), building a controller from scratch, refactoring a messy model into [better patterns](https://codeclimate.com/blog/7-ways-to-decompose-fat-activerecord-models/) given a few hints, etc.

As far as ""MUST HAVE 3 YEARS"" - writing job descriptions is hard even when you know exactly what you're looking for - and businesses almost never know what they really want for an employee. Even early in my career, I never paid much attention to the job description. I'm self taught, and most of them *absolutely must have a degree in CS* - but most of the time they didn't care about my education if we were a good fit. 

I wouldn't put too much stock in it - if you like a position and the company, by all means send in a resume, even if they don't have open positions! I've gotten several jobs simply by saying ""hey I'm looking for what to do next and your company seems really great, do you have any open positions? Here's my resume.""

I've started a number of companies with products build on Ruby on Rails and a consistent problem is finding extra help. Obviously everybody is looking for the sheep with 5  legs, lots of experience, lots of frameworks, lots of schooling, teamplayer but also a hero, etc etc. But in the end anyone who can show they are a decent developer with a decent grasp of the rails framework will be hired.

In other words, depending on the area you live in (and the availability of startups/scale-ups there) I would not worry much about finding a job. I'd apply for those jobs with 3years+ experience requirements and explain my background, I'd be surprised if the actual number of years rails experience will be what would lead to not being hired.

Initially to increase development speed for the company I then worked for, after 2 years I started for my self, building software for my startups and hiring help where needed.

    https://myrailsapp.com/question/1

In that case, the :id is mapped to the 1. So it looks like:

    params = {id: 1}

Now let's go a little bit farther with this. Imagine you have an index view, but you want to filter by category. Your URL might look something like this:

    https://myrailsapp.com/questions?category=foo

Now you will have a params hash that appears as follows:

    params = {category: ""foo""}

Params is just a variable that holds hash. The hash keys and values are set by the URL making the request. 

    @category_id = Category.find_by(name: params[:category]).id

You have retrieved your category id, but you could just retrieve the entire record by chopping of the .id part.

Assuming CampaignInstance must exist (though I would suggest finding a better name), why would it and Campaign both have many ContactLists? Is it possible to use  one list for the Campaign itself?

**Async Worker**

Offload the task of creating the actual contents of the CSV to a background worker, such as Sidekiq, and have the browser client poll for a ""finished"" status to then push the data as a download to the browser.  I have implemented with actual database models, bit of state machine, used paper\_clip to store the attached CSV and a rather slim controller method for instance.

I have also used ActionCable to pretty nicely show progress generating the CSV and to show the download immediately when available, avoiding polling the server.

**Streaming Content**

These days I vote for this option.  Using live streaming and lazy record loading, I can immediately push the HTTP headers to the browser for file name and content type, then lazily load the collection from the database, and for each record convert to CSV output and stream to the browser socket.

The 30 second timeout on Heroku is only a time for how long *before the browser receives the first part of a response*.  You don't have to provide the entire response, just get something started to the browser.  This is why the streaming solution works so well in my opinion.  Far less code as well!

carlosramireziii,"*In regard to associating* `Transaction` *with 2 accounts...*

Typically the Rails convention for `belongs_to` is to name the ID column after the name of the model you are associating with. In your case that would be `account_id`. However, when you create a model that joins 2 other models of the same type (e.g. `Transaction` belongs to 2 different `Account` records), you can no longer follow that convention.

In this case you need to name the ID column for each association something unique. You were on the right track with `sender_account` and `recipient_account`. Using those association names, your `transactions` table would need to include a column `sender_account_id` as well as a `recipient_account_id`.

Once you have those columns in place, you need to set up the associations in the `Transaction` model. Normally you would put `belongs_to :account` and Rails would automatically infer everything about the association, however we can’t follow that convention because we have 2 account associations, not 1.

In this case, you set up each association using the unique names we gave it. Because the names don’t match the class of the association, you also need to specify what type the association should be using the [`class_name` option](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods/belongs_to) (in your case `Account`).

    class Transaction 
       belongs_to :sender_account, class_name: “Account""

morphemass,"As others have said, not using let/before usually means that you are testing the wrong thing, testing too much, or your code is difficult to test. 

- let should be used for things that *change* in the context of each test.
- before should be used to set up the conditions common to each test.
- shared_examples are the place to test common behaviour.
- shared_contexts are the place to set up common dependencies.

I see a lot of newcomers to rspec duplicating a lot of code by failing to refactor into these test 'building blocks' and it is an absolute *nightmare* to maintain because when the requirements change, it might impact on 100s of tests.

Should I also mention that let is lazy loaded and unless you are also very careful you can dramatically impact the performance of your test suite? In the past on a 5K+ suite, I've cut it from 10 minutes to under 3  by refactoring away from instance variables that were all doing unnecessary work. 

The one place I do agree with though is in shared_contexts - unless these are properly documented (e.g. 'use this context to set up for database access') this can make the tests difficult to understand and maintain.

Basically if I get a PR with instance variables in it I request that let blocks are used and (IMO) most senior Ruby/Rails devs will do likewise, so I don't think you are doing anyone any favours here.

P.S. Specs should also be small - if my spec hits over 100 lines of code it suggests to me that my code is doing too much (probably violating SRP) and I need to refactor.

Make a list of them(better be a clickable one so that we know what you would have done) and maybe me or someone would advise some readings or screencasts or conference videos or anything that could help you build that particular feature. I think it is of a more mature thinking to try something on your own than simply searching for given solutions and copy-pasting them(I mean whole projects.

I want to say you could get away with landlords and tenants both being “Users” but your DB architecture would be a little more complicated.  You’d solve the problems by starting from the assumption a user can be a landlord and a tenant at the same time.

Then change the linguistics of organisation and organisations to something like owned_organisation and organisations.

The project demonstrated I was a self-starter, knew the fundamentals of Rails and could bring code to production (my family member actually uses the application I built, it's hosted on a DO droplet).

One nice feature I built in that my interviewers really enjoyed was the Invoice/Estimate to PDF feature I built in using PDFKit.

ActiveModel_Dirty,"I mean, all of the motives you outlined are valid. The counter-arguments and the larger picture of it all is where it falls apart though.

Having to use commas and \`!==\` syntax are... trivial reasons to call coffeescript superior in the context of that motive. The operators are all nice things, but we're just talking about syntactic sugar at this point, which I don't believe is a valid reason to pick a language or framework outside of the early stages of development.

The vast majority of the reasons we're seeing people switch away from coffeescript, outside of what you've already outlined, is because there's just no compelling reason to maintain and track another JS framework if you don't need to. If, for example, you want to use React in your application (or leave it open to the future), it's much easier to have your codebase written in the base-level language that React works off of than it would be to try to integrate coffeescript into react and have them play nicely. The app I'm working on right now uses Coffeescript and Vue.js and I hate it. Albeit we only use Coffeescript for things like constructors and some light one-off services, I'd much prefer it was all just ES6. Also of note that at that point you have three dependencies vs two.

ES6 is an indication that JavaScript is headed in the right direction, a hope we did not have in the early days of coffeescript v1. Now that we see where it's headed, we don't need *all* the niceties that coffeescript provides because we know that JavaScript is now flexible enough to be able to implement the things that developers *really* want.

I, and I imagine a lot of others, hold the belief that you should have as few dependencies and potential for breakage/inconsistency in production code as you possibly can. While, yes, some browsers need to transpile ES6 to ES5, those browser versions will be phased out because JS is a language that is capable of setting new standards across the board, where as Coffeescript is not. I.e. there will come a day that ES6 does not need to be transpiled, that day won't come for Coffeescript. It's also less effort for the transpiler to move from ES6 to ES5 than it is CoffeeScript to ES6 then to ES5 (or does it compile straight to ES5?).

Outside of that, the update cycle is going to be much slower than with ES6. ES6 gets updated when ES6 is updated. Coffeescript will need to wait for the ES6 update and then update itself after the fact, leaving you using potentially older or vulnerable code for longer.

And just my own personal opinion: I don't really like coffeescript. The reasons are kind of similar to some of the things you like about it, but I find debugging it significantly more difficult than debugging Javascript. Especially if you use the dev tools, you're never going to see coffeescript in there, so you're forcing yourself to use both either way, and that level of context switching gets annoying. Because on the left you're looking at JS then your brain has to reverse-transpile the next move in your code to Coffeescript.

It's also just much easier for me to keep track of complex logic with the explicit curly brackets and such everywhere.  In general I'm not a fan of indentation-based logic.

Edit: Also you mentioned lodash and this is just more a question of curiosity for you since I have not used a ton of Coffeescript 2. ES6 allows you to only import the components you need from Lodash, similar to ruby, by saying (for example) `import isEqual from 'lodash.isequal'` which skirts loading the entire thing on each page that uses an underscore. Did they add that functionality to Coffeescript as well?",1533155036.0
cutety,"**TL;DR;** If you like CoffeeScript, and are using it, then by all means keep using it. Just be aware that until it provides some unique capabilities that can't be achieved in ES6 (i.e. like CoffeeScript before ES6 did) that not a lot of people are going to be also interested in using, especially outside Rails development.

> Why would you migrate from coffee then, if most of ES6 you can have with coffee 2 (and more)?

Because if you want to have any non rails developer (and probably a lot rails devs) work on your code (e.g. a JS dev) they'll have to learn CoffeeScript and all it's special little things. CoffeeScript doesn't offer anything except an alternative syntax, and whether or not you think that syntax is better is personal opinion.

> Indent based blocks, like ruby.

Ruby doesn't have indent based blocks, just like JS, Ruby does not care how your code/blocks are indented, unlike Python. This is completely valid Ruby:

    def fn(foo)
    puts foo
              puts foo + foo
      foo.tap do
    puts foo
          end

I used to think that was an advantage of Python, but I've since grown to hate it, and is one of the reasons I don't use Python anymore.

> Not having to put commas between every object property

Personal preference, but I really don't see how this is in anyway an advantage.

> The holy grail existential operator: value? intead of `value !== 'undefined'`

Yes, JS nil/null checks can be verbose. But, only if you want them to be. You can define a function that does this, or download a library that does that for you (I use ramda.js), so then I just call `isNil(value)`. This has the benefit of being immediately obvious to someone reading it, while the `?` operator you have to, again, know CoffeeScript syntax.

> Insanely better operators

The only two I see that don't have a comparable operator in JS are `in` and `%%`. I've never had to use `%%` for whatever that's for, and you can just use `[3, 4, 5].includes(foo)` instead of whatever they show as the alternative.

> No need to state return, just the value in the last line.

Another personal preference. Typing `return` in JS doesn't bother me, and not having to use it in Ruby doesn't bother me. Some would say though that `explicit > implicit`, but again personal preferences. Also, JS does have implicit returns for single line arrow functions `() => true` returns `true` without having to explicitly return it.

> -> instead of function

So, now if someone is coming from JS and working with CoffeeScript code, first glances they `->` will likely assume that it is the same as `=>` and won't bind a `this` context given that appear to be the same operator. So, again this is confusing for someone coming to CoffeeScript while offering no major benefit. I almost never have to use `function` in any of my JS anyways as arrow functions are good enough, and the cases I do actually want it to bind a `this` context are for object methods, in which case I'd use `{ foo() {} }` which is the same as `{ foo: function() {} }`.

> The amount of time and pain these and other features spared is incredible to me. IMO, it fixed most problems people hate js for, that ES6 didn't fix.

I literally don't see a single thing on that list that isn't in ES6 outside of a few syntactic sugar things like `if then` vs `? :`. Or comprehensions, which I though were a terrible/confusing language feature in Python and I think the same for CoffeeScript, instead you should using JS's bread-and-butter, higher order functions, `forEach`, `map`, `reduce`, `filter`.

> Yeah, so? Isn't ES6 code transpiled when not supported, for example, for browsers?

Most modern browsers fully support ES6 (save for modules), and (eventually) in the future you won't need to transpile ES6 for full browser support. You'll always have to transpile CoffeeScript.

All the stated advantages you've outlined are more-or-less personal preferences, you didn't provide a single thing CoffeeScript decisively does better. That's why people are ""abandoning"" it, ES6 is a great language, does everything CoffeeScript does (just in a non-ruby like syntax), thus it provides no major advantages at the cost of having to learn an entirely new syntax, as well as force others to learn it if they want/need to work on the project. Compared to something like TypeScript (another superset), which has a syntax that is not radically different and provides compile time static typing, which is a huge benefit/motivator for adopting it and learning it's (much smaller) syntax and quirks.",1533158929.0

CoffeeScript was good and the best thing out there for a little while.  

ES6 came in and improved upon what existed.  At the same time, the entire JavaScript ecosystem was rapidly developing and moving in the direction of React/Vue/etc..  People picked up ES6 and the JavaScript community rapidly evolved and matured on the back of ES6.

CoffeeScript 2 launched into a crowded space.  ES6 is well-established, TypeScript is gaining steam, and there are a bunch of other options in the space as well that do sorta similar things (Dart, Babel, etc).  

Its just not ""more better"" enough to pull people away.  Which tbh is kind of saying something, because JS devs seem to love having their own flavor of whatever to slightly optimize against their personal preferences.

patleb,"It really is just a matter of preferences. For me, I think that CoffeeScript is the best compromise between working with both Ruby and JavaScript (being Ruby the primary language). I've done a fair amount of Opal and Javascript as well and I found out that CoffeeScript really brings the mental switching to a minimum. Although, we decided to keep the same code style between CoffeeScript and Ruby and added a bunch of wrappers to core classes and Lodash to make it object-oriented with a Ruby syntax, so we can write Coffeescript as if it was Ruby-like most of the time:

    filtered_values: (query) ->
      values = @cached_values.each_with_object [], (value, label, memo) ->
        unless value.blank() || label.downcase().excludes(query)
          memo.push { value, label }
      values.sort_by('label')

your-pineapple-thief,"Coffeescript has its own quirks and questionable features. What is the value of using \`and\` and \`or\` booleans over \`&&\` and \`||\`? Having just one set of boolean operators means less time wasted on agreeing on code style of your codebase. And if you don't waste this time - congratulations, you now have different codestyle on your codebase, which hurts readability.

Indentation as syntax is also a thing I ABSOLUTELY hate a lot. whitespace-sensitive syntax could introduce a lot of subtle bugs (just one space char in passing anon callback as function param completely changes resulting code - why would I want this?).

Another big reason is that all that react/vue code is in ES now. all the packages on npm, all the documentation, all articles, all books - so if you develop in those you really have to know ES. And if learn ES, why on earth would you then waste time learning coffeescript? There are no important language features which coffee has but ES has not.

On implicit returns - this is really double-edged sword. First of all, if you dont need return value in your function, now you are returning value which is essentially wasted. And depending on your last statement in the function, this value can be nontrivial datastructure, and returning stuff like that from each function call in a big enough project WILL affect performance in a measureable way, and mobile devices aren't that snappy at running lots of code.
At really, is it really THAT hard to type SIX characters? I don't think so. Explicit is always better than implicit.

I don't think that trying to pretend that your javascript is ruby will improve your understanding of javascript internals, how the language and VM works. Cause javascript isn't ruby and will never be. It's a functional language with some bizzare prototype inheritance thrown in, and you would do yourself a favor by actually learning and understanding bizzare inheritance and true nature of the language. And note, this is coming from a man who's full-stack ruby on rails developer (4 years of experience). 

Bastard nature of the language. Coffeescript is very clearly not Ruby. And it isn't quite Python. It's a bastard child of both, and in my opinion the language just isn't designed well enough. Features are not coherent or consistent or well thought, it was an experiment which caught rise in popularity. It feels to me features were added just for coolness factor without much thinking.

Syntactic sugar is sweet, but too much sugar can cause diabetes. Don't know about you, but I'm alright with few extra keystrokes if it makes things more explicit. And I have, you know, text editor. and this nice little program really helps with typing less in javascript. I dont think your language should try to do work which your IDE can. I enjoy terseness of Ruby, but to me coffeescript is clearly far inferior to ruby design-wise.

ES is a standart. It is standartised language with careful consideration for new features and some actual direction going on. Updates are yearly and you can use proposals if they are really nice without much waiting.

Another example would be if each Task had multiple Notes that were attached to it. In that case, if you wanted to get a list of all the Notes attached to a given User, you could add the following code to the User model:

`has_many :notes, through: :tasks`

Users would still have_many Tasks through the ToDoList, but now the join model itself is a lot more useful and has a reason to exist beyond simply associating two other tables.

You'll have to read through the source, but basically you create a new upload with three parameters:

\- file: file object from your form

\- url: the url to create a direct upload (the controller action that activestorage provides)

\- delegate: an object that implements stuff like ""directUploadWillCreateBlobWithXHR"", and "" directUploadWillStoreFileWithXHR"", which are basically your hooks to configure the XHR it's using under the hood.

The upload doesn't start until you call the create method with a callback. The first argument is for an error, and the second is an object with some metadata about the new blob. The main thing you're interested in here is the ""signed\_id"". You can retrieve urls to the stored file using this, and I believe it's also the id you use to create attachments by assigning it to the macro fields for ""has\_attached\_whatever"".

This is the same JS that would run if you build a form with direct\_upload: true, but the DirectUploadController class would be orchestrating things and resetting the form if something failed.

Big fat caveat: ActiveStorage is convenient, but really inefficient for hosting public files on a website that gets a decent amount of traffic. Each file requires an extra request to your app to generate a signed url that gets redirected to. Each individual client will cache this after the first request, but its still not great.

1. Set up the form. So the form in your view need all the fields that you want from the user. Behind the form you neen a controller with an action that will accept data from your form. (Permit the params, route to post, and tell the form that the data will be submitted to this route)

2. Take the form data and turn it into JSON.
In your controller, take the form data and give to a service class that will serialise the data and turn in to JSON. You can use a gem for the second part. 

3. Send the JSON to MapBox. Back in your controller, take the JSON and send it to the MapBox API. You can use Net::HTTP or a wrapper like HttParty for this. Also you probably need to authenticate against the MapBox API in some way. Please check the docs of MapBox how to do this.

ethboy2000,"Do you mean the test object database ids are increasing on every test run?

This is just your database auto incrementing on each row created. The previously used id information isn’t lost between test runs.

As an aside, your test objects will be just be created in the order you specify, assuming they are actually being executed in order. However if for example you’re assigning each one a variable name in a `let` block then they will get created in the order they are referenced, unless you place a bang in front of the let variable name.

For example:

```
let(:object_a) { FactoryBot.create(:object) }
let(:object_b) { FactoryBot.create(:object) }

it “creates objects as they are referenced” do
  object_b
  object_a
  expect(object_b.id).to be < object_a.id
end
```

The above should pass.

However if you were to change the let blocks to this:

```
let!(:object_a) { FactoryBot.create(:object) }
let!(:object_b) { FactoryBot.create(:object) }
```

then the test above would fail, simply because by using `let!` you’re telling rspec to call these blocks (in order) before the test is run, rather than just whenever they’re referenced.

I switch off from read / working through a certain amount of books / tutorials, then I build a project (or single feature) that is approximately at that level of knowledge (since there will always be things not accounted for there will be growth).  After the project it is completed to whatever specifications, I'm back to reading / testing bits of code to prepare for the next project at a higher level of complexity / professionalism, or building on the previous one.

jhnhrpr,"For what it's worth, here's how I recently approached 'making something I want', starting with a single page... 

1. Thought about the basic version of what I wanted to see: a simple countdown app that shows the number of days to a given milestone date, for goal setting/tracking. Basically a page with a giant number in the middle, showing how many days to go until a certain date, with a title and description underneath it. 
2. Fired up Webflow and designed the page (desktop and mobile/tablet layouts). This could have been coded by hand or with another WYSIWYG editor, but I know my way around Webflow and was able to make what I wanted in 10-15 minutes.
3. Exported the HTML and CSS code from Webflow.
4. Created a new Rails app.
5. Copied the Webflow HTML and CSS into the right spots in my Rails app. 
6. Looked at the page for the parts that should be dynamic (from the database) and created a model with only the attributes I needed to make the page I created dynamic, ran the migration, added some dummy data to the database (can be manually in the console or as db seeds).
7. Added the necessary controller code and changed the static text to dynamic in the ERB template.

Voila. 

From that point, I've been tweaking things, adding other features, etc. It starts with what I want to see (the user experience/interface), actually designing/coding the front end of that, then adding the code I need to make that work. 

You don't have to know what the finished/final state of your app will be. You can start with the 'essence' or core functionality of what you want your app to do and then build from there. 

What's the one thing that is absolutely essential to what you're building? Usually you can identify one thing. Much of the rest of the stuff you build works to support that one thing. 

I also did this with a comedic weather video app I worked on a few years ago. It occurred to me at the time that the really important part of what I was building was querying a weather API and mapping its possible weather conditions to certain pre-determined weather categories (based on the videos that my friends had already shot). This seemed like the toughest thing I had to do, which in retrospect after more experience/comfortability with programming seems fairly trivial. Anyhow, once I figured out how to make that work, the rest of my job was tacking on other stuff and making it look good. 

For your property listings page, it sounds like you may be able to get started with a Rails scaffold (specifically the index and show pages, for a master-detail sorta thing) and customize them to your liking.

djfrodo,"As others have said I think writing something you want is the *best* way to learn how to program.

How I would start is by figuring out something you want to make. Doing ""Todo List"" tutorials is pretty meaningless - it's basically copying someone's homework, you don't know the material, you just followed a recipe.

Look at your project from a data perspective. How will you store your data? Probably in an sql database - so, what tables, columns, and fields will you need.

Learn how to write at least a little bit of SQL by hand, so you'll know how sql databases work.

Active record in rails is pretty awesome and makes 80% of the work pretty trivial, it's the last 20% that will drive you crazy (basically that's programming in a nutshell, db or not, the last 10-20% is always the hardest).

Next I'd define the interface. Do you want an SPA, or do you want an old school html template site?

Third I'd learn jQuery AND vanilla Javascript. jQuery has gone out of fashion, but for the most part, coupled with good old plain javascript jQuery can do whatever you want.

Why I say this is because jumping into something like React if you don't understand Javascript is a very bad idea.

So, once you've learned sql (and just skip the NOSQL stuff and use Postgres - not MySQL), HTML, CSS, and Javascript it's really up to you what you want to do next.

Personally I'd go with Redis or Memcache for a caching layer to give Postgres some relief.

Get a good design/designer, and you're off.

In order of most simple to most complex:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
SQL

Part of the process is making mistakes and learning from them. If I can give you some tips just to avoid unnecessary pitfalls:

* Get a solid foundation of Ruby before you get deep into Rails. Namespacing, keyword arguments, blocks, etc. Trust me.
* Testing. You need to understand how to test both objects (models, etc.) and requests. Just use RSpec.
* POROs are your friend. Complicated logic? Don't put it in a view, controller, or (most of the time) an ActiveRecord model.
* If you have a bunch of JS, get an understanding of how the asset pipeline manifest files work, and see if you can break it up so only certain pages load certain JS.

Start small. Really small. Solve the smallest problem people are willing to pay for. It’s easy to try and build more and more features to satisfy every customer request. Resist that urge and focus on solving problems well.

Talk to potential customers. Do this before writing any code. It’s advice that gets repeated over and over and so often ignored. Talking to businesses in your target market will help you understand the problem and how to solve it.

As others have stated, start with tutorials. Then build a few small apps to see how it all comes together. One issue you’ll face is choosing which gems to use. There are gems for all sorts of things and often you’ll spend more time deciding which gem to use than implementing the one you choose.

And everyone has an opinion on what’s best. Some love Devise, some say it’s overkill. Some say ActiveStorage is all you need while some swear by PaperClip, CarrierWave, Shrine, or a couple I’m forgetting. They all handle file uploads but in different ways.

EDIT: You can even include the font-awesome icon w scss https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/sass",1532423005.0
LeastProfessional,"Take everything with a pinch of salt, i'm only *new* to Ruby on rails and theres probably a ton of other ways to do this.

Why don't you add company type into the div class and then use CSS to change the font-colors? Try something like this:

`<div class=""card shadow p-3 bg-white rounded <%= company.company_type %>"" style=""width:20rem; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"">`

This is assuming you are storing the company type within a database. You will need to sluggify the class which can be done through gems or just by creating a method yourself to do it!

If you use a framework like SCSS, you can use nesting to your advantage to write cleaner code! Although, just chaining classes is good enough! For example;

`.card.startup { color: red; } .card.e-commerse { color: blue; }` etc...

As for the font-awesome stuff, i've personally never used it but I know that you can use the 'content' property in CSS to do this. To do this you simply put the unicode value of the font-awesome icon.

`.card.startup { color: red; .fas { content: ""\f000""; } }`

`.card.e-commerse { color: blue; .fas { content: ""\f008""; } }`

This page will tell you all the Unicode values. [http://astronautweb.co/snippet/font-awesome/](http://astronautweb.co/snippet/font-awesome/).

If this doesn't work, just make a helper method that will look at the company type and return the correct font awesome icon

`def get_fa_company_type`

`case company_type`

`when ""Startup""`

`return ""fa-bookmark""`

`when ""...""`

`end`

`end`

and place this inside the <i> tag as such `<i class=""fas <%= get_fa_company_type %>"" style=""font-size: 20px; color:#F08C2D ""></i>`

What this will do is it will go into that helper method, look at the company type and return a string and place it into the class!

Just a tip, you can use your validation (if's and unless's) inside the rails tags, for example:

`<%= image_tag company.logo_url(:thumbnail), style: ""width: 40%; height:40%; margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 50px;"", class: ""img-fluid"" unless company.logo_url.nil? %>`

You should store the variable in the data property of some HTML node, for example <body data-user=""<%= user %>"">. Then in JS const user = JSON.parse(document.getElementByTagName('body').dataset.user);

Or something like that I can't remember the js syntax off the top of my head.


You could also make an AJAX request for the variable. Please whatever you choose, don't use global variables, and please DON'T share random data in a non-explicit way between files. You can make global classes (/functions), because if you have an object initialization somewhere the person reading your code will know they have to look for the class in some file, that's the standard practice. With variables it is not. People will have a very hard time finding it. Also there's the potential issue that if you accidentally change the variable in one file, it may break stuff in very subtle ways in another file.


Also, you should be wrapping all your JS code in (function() { /* code */})();. It's an anonymous function, immediately invoked at load. This will prevent accidental pollution in the global space. (Wrapping it in parentheses is important, won't work otherwise.)

The MySQL server runs as a daemon, which means that it's a process that doesn't intend to be killed often, so it's almost always running in the background unless you specifically kill it. Depending on how you have it installed, you may need to restart it every time you reboot your machine (tools like Homebrew automate this for you.) The local rails server OTOH, isn't daemonized and is usually restarted several times throughout the course of development. 

If you're starting out with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other major DB technology, I highly recommend getting comfortable accessing your DBs and writing queries from the terminal.

This allows you to synchronize changes between your model and view on the client without reloading a page. Rails has [action cables](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html) since version 5 that you could use for this between server and client.

Another way to approach this (before Rails 5) is to simply make the change in the UI (JavaScript) and post to your rails server that this has changes (ajax). This is why people are pointing you to JavaScript.

Alternatively just using Rails and JS without action cables or ajax, you can create a hidden form element, toggle that when the button is clicked on and submit the form to rails. This is untidy however in that it requires a whole page reload for a simple change on the page. But it can be easier to implement and learn. :)

You can call $.ajax() to one of your paths to do a POST and update a model within the same $on() function that's manipulating the button class. Then you won't need the actual URL in the link_to method, and you should then understand why so many links are ""stubbed out"" with ""#"" when using these sorts of techniques. ;-) You can grab a return JSON string, rendered by your API endpoint, to put back in the page DOM when you do this.

• Application-level lock tables as you described - but the main problem is when to release the lock if the user abandons. As another reply suggests, websockets/actioncable are one way for a) the server to detect a client disappearing/timing out, and b) for a client to be notified that its lock was broken.  
• Use a revision control system e.g. git as your document store and try to merge the diffs.  
• If the data permits, use a [conflict-free replicated data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type).  
• If your domain model enables this, record changes in the [event-sourced](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) style.

One I've never used:

• Use real-time collaborative updates via an [Operational Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation).

in0pinatus,"I run a marketplace written in Rails that shifts millions of dollars a year.

I can tell you that the software elements of running a marketplace are the least of my concerns. I use a straightforward implementation of double-entry book-keeping for polymorphic entities that does most of the heavy lifting for audit and accounting purposes.  Take a look at [plutus](https://github.com/mbulat/plutus).

The financial, legal and regulatory concerns are the far more complex part, especially in regard to acceptance of payments as an agent. I am complying with (and ensuring that my principal entities comply with) the agent-principal tax rules, the anti-money-laundering laws, the privacy regulations and more besides. These are not easy hurdles for a small company and the consequences of screwing any of them up are severe.

The biggest ongoing concern we have is refund risk. It only takes one provider to fail in their obligations to leave us exposed to some potentially very large claims. We carefully manage the release of funds to minimise this risk. Basically we sync our cash movements with our opinion of what everyone's revenue recognition policy should be. One of the first things I splashed out at founding was a really good lawyer to draft a really strong Agency Agreement.

For the mechanical parts that move money around, I think Stripe Connect is very capable but also way too expensive. I do not use it, preferring a local fintech (here in Australia) who do something very similar. However it will simplify some elements for you, including the know-your-customer elements of AML and ensuring that you get to clip each ticket and thereby have a reliable revenue stream.

I recommend you have an availability plan or strong SLA because if you are down then your providers are losing money, and it will be your fault and your problem.

Whatever you do, make sure you're on top of the additional complexity of running a marketplace service. If you don't have an accounting or business management qualification yourself (or equivalent experience), I recommend making sure you're in cahoots with someone who does.

Nrdrsr,"For me personally, this is a very annoying problem right now, particularly from a performance point-of-view.

Let's say you are building a restaurant review site like Yelp or a Hotel booking site like Hotels.com

Your front-end engineering is important. There are going to be a lot of little interactive components, popups, meters, toggles, etc. that you want to show to your user. To keep your front-end engineering team happy, you want to let them use their favored frameworks.

You also want to do client-side routing for snappy page-loads, so that visitors can quickly browse between Hotels or Restaurants and make their selection. The front-end calls the API and asks for hotel-specific information and renders the page with templating.

At the same time you want to provide a great personalized experience. Most of your traffic will come from Google. Most will land on an individual category page or landing page, like ""Hotels in Dubai"" or ""Restaurants in Ann Arbor"". You might wanna show different content to an American visitor when they visit Hotels in Dubai, and different content to local who visits ""Restaurants in Ann Arbor"". The vast majority of content will be the same, but there may be parts of the page that you cleverly generate based on what you know about the user - like location, previous purchases, etc. You might even have a little snippet on the hotel page that highlights hotels which the user has stayed at before.

So how do you navigate the various use-cases here, assuming you use SSR.

One use-case is if a new user lands on the page via a search engine. In this case you know their location and you want to send them some promotional content, local currency pricing, etc. this means that your server now needs to do a whole bunch of logic and store lookups before the templating step, and then serve the rendered page to the user. You can also opt to complete the personalization logic on the client-side. What that means is that the user will first see a page that shows dollar prices and then after a few seconds it does an ugly flash and shows Euros (assuming the user is from Europe). This is even more complicated if you factor in internationalization or localization of languages.

I suspect some folks opt to go with the ugly post-server-load morphing here, where the currency toggles after the page has loaded. This will also take effect if the user has bookmarked the individual hotel / restaurant page and visits it later. This time the client-side currency toggle and other personalization (language, etc.) would be quicker.

For others who choose to do it on the server, you could potentially pre-render and cache certain parts of the HTML and store it as strings in-memory or on disk, and then append those raw strings to each other to generate a template, but that sort of solution seems very inelegant given an otherwise fairly well-engineered approach. Templating on the server for a site with a reasonably high amount of traffic is going to increase your hardware and concurrency requirements on the server, in order to enjoy the benefits offered by your front-end framework.

Templating on the server-side is also painful in terms of performance. The server has to run a rendering engine that can read your templates and spit out HTML. Ideally frameworks should make it simple to mix server side rendering with server-side pre-rendering, where a lot of the repetitive parts of rendering can be cached and assembled together. This is painful to accomplish in most frameworks (would love some suggestions here if anyone has good strategies for this).

Performance matters a lot where SEO is concerned, and more-so where users, particularly mobile users are concerned. In many domains, it's very common for visitors to be on 3G or 4G spotty connections, and they will leave your site if it doesn't load in 4 seconds, or if it takes time to become interactive. If your page has a bloated JS file or a long time to first byte time (likely if you are doing personalization or something like that), then you are going to be penalized in one way or the other.  

Fortunately, as of this year, Google actually allows you to serve a different version of your page to Googlebot, which contains only the content that you want to index. Unfortunately apart from a passing mention about this during a talk at Google I/O this year, I was unable to find a clear policy on how Google plans to enforce the obvious avenues for abuse as a result of this relaxation of policy. The worst thing that can happen is that their bot will find that your page is too different from the version you are serving users, and flag your entire site - and then your engineering team is not sleeping until the problem is fixed. Google hasn't done a good job of being clear on this, or I haven't found any clarity on this policy change.

This really needs to become an area of serious concern for the front-end framework folks. This is my #1 issue with an otherwise beautiful ecosystem of front-end engineering tools.  I don't know if I am just unaware of less painful + smarter approaches to solving these problems from a performance-obsessive point of view, or whether they genuinely exist, but thus far I have found that few frameworks offer first-class support for these use-cases. As a result you end up compromising or writing your own caching / pre-rendering pipelines which just seems like a lot of unnecessary work when you are dealing with multiple products.

The sweet-spot seems to be using Rails primarily, and relying on Vue or React ONLY for interactive components like booking widgets, calendars, filters, menus, etc. which don't really need to be indexed.",1531079357.0

* Default colour could be handled on the database level with a default value. 
* If you want to handle assigning colour in the model `self.color.presence ||= DEFAULT_COLOR` would account for the fact that someone might *set* the color to `""""`, which is truthy.
* I find this style of validation declaration somewhat unfortunate. I would bet that the question ""which validations are set for *this* attribute"" is asked way more often ""I wonder which attributes have a numericality validation"". Therefore I prefer the attribute-focussed declaration: `validates :username, presence: true, uniqueness: true` - now I know immediately what's going on with the username, and don't have to scan twenty declarations if the symbol appears anywhere else.
* The default organization should probably not be part of the user generation, since it's obviously conditional/optional. A form/service object for ""new account creation/signup"" and another one for ""adding user to existing organisation"" would reduce the User's responsibilities, make testing easier, and make business logic more explicit (at least that's what I assume the context is). 
* Also all the `on: create` validations should be in those form objects, or else you're messing around with them in every unit test. 
* Also also the `create_organization` callback, if you really want to use a callback, should probably be in `after_create`, not in `after_save`, because it really needs to check only once, I assume (but that depends on your specific business logic). I doubt someone would create an org in an update action to an existing user.
* Username is stripped before validation, but at that point it may (still) be nil and you'd get an exception. Better handle that possibility with a guard clause.

Instead of creating the organization when the accessor is set, I’d prefer to see it done in the form class or controller. If it needs to happen in multiple places, you could keep the method, but just call it in the code that creates the user instead of relying on the accessor and callback. 

IMO accessors that control validations and callbacks are a code smell. It’s hard to reason about code that uses them. 

The moment I start needing different validations in different contexts, I usually move them out of the model into form classes. Much easier to reason about. Easier to test.

* Create the organization on my UsersController. If the creation logic exceeds 10 lines, I would extract it into a service class.
* Create a separate model for user colors and wrap it in a service. Then I could do `ColorService.color_code_for(user_record)`, this service can then encapsulate the default color and only create record for users with a customized color. This I do because I assume that color is not a central part of the user model, but that's just my assumption.
* Group the validations by attribute rather than constraint. `validates :address, ...`
* Put the logic regarding terms and e-mail validation (write the same e-mail address twice) somewhere else. Probably in the controller that deals with it. Maybe even client side.
* Remove moderation mode logic and validate the presence of these attributes in the controller that deals with them.
* Keep the username normalization because it's universal when working with the model (Nobody - not even admins or API calls should not be able to set uppercased or unstripped usernames), also the code is fast, simple, useful (solves a real and frequent problem) and doesn't hit the database. I would probably normalize the e-mail too, though. :-)
* Look condescendingly at the `geocoded_by :address` call, because it hits the effing internets as part of saving a user, but probably keep it, because it's really easy to understand and implement thanks to the geocoder gem. If the geocoding service appears to be unreliable, I may want to put the geocoding in a background job. That way, I can save users faster and if the third party geocoding service is down, I don't risk timeouts or internal server errors on my part because the saving operation fails.
* Definitely not put any logic or constraints into my database. I don't get why people have a thing for that. DHH has discouraged this on multiple occasions. Database constraints hamper database portability, it fails to produce useful user feedback (You cannot easily map a database exception to a validation error) and it hides the constraints from the developer, because constraints show up in the autogenerated schema (which I never look at) and not the model (where I look). The only case where I would consider adding a database constraint is if my application is behaving unpredictably (unlikely) or if theoretically violating the constraint could have catastrophic effects on the business.
* Now the `attr_accessor`s would be gone and the model would focus on the essentials. That users have usernames and e-mail addresses and they must be present, lowercase and stripped of trailing spaces. Furthermore a user can have an organization, but that is optional.

Blimey85,"Need more info. The three parts is most likely due to image format. You can have a progressive image for example. I doubt S3 is the problem. Image size is going to be the main issue. Smaller images load faster. That aside, you can do various things to make them appear to load faster. One method I like is doing a very small image and stretching it. You start with a 2x2 or 3x3 version of you image. So only 4 or 9 pixels. Then you stretch that to the size of the original image. That’s inlined in your html and replaced once the full-size image loads.

I used this on a project a few years back and it worked great. Everything was automatic and it looked a bit nicer than just having a placeholder. If you want to do placeholders without the small images, you calculate the average color of the image and show that. It looks pretty good.

I’m on mobile and don’t have my bookmarks handy but if you google how Insta and Pinterest do placeholder images you’ll see what I’m talking about. For either of these methods, I store the info, either the calculated color or the 3x3 image (code for the image, not the binary file) in the database. Don’t want to add additional trips to the server.

Another option is to load assets from multiple domains so more can load at the same time. This is less of a thing now than it was years ago and not something I do. If you have a whole lot of images then it might be worth looking into. I’m not sure how many connections browsers will make concurrently to a domain but it hasn’t been an issue for me.

Edit: Something like this: https://github.com/zouhir/lqip-loader/blob/master/README.md but I would cache the result in the DB and only call this on images the first time. ",1530817872.0

HelloAnnyong,"The easy/traditional way of paginating records in SQL is `ORDER`, `OFFSET` and `LIMIT`. (See my suggested scope to put in `ApplicationRecord` in a comment below.)

Your SQL query (and ActiveRecord query below for comparison) would for example look like:

    -- SQL
    SELECT * FROM widgets
    WHERE user_id = 123
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
    OFFSET 10
    LIMIT 10;

    # Rails
    Widget.where(user_id: 123).order(:created_at => :desc).offset(10).limit(10)

The client would pass in a page number (above that would be `2`) and your backend code would translate that into an offset and limit.

And very importantly, make sure you have an index on `(user_id, created_at DESC)`.

As essepi pointed out, also """"""it doesn't scale"""""", a scary sounding phrase that has some kernel of truth to it, but you probably shouldn't take too literally. If you're paginating over queries with thousands of records, you're almost certainly fine. Get up to millions and maybe you should measure performance, but you should do that anyway at that point.

The reason the offset/limit approach is so popular is because it's dead simple, works with any ordering, and requires basically zero-configuration.

One downside is that ""it doesn't scale"", but a bigger one IMO is that if a record is inserted in between queries, you may end up seeing a record on page 2 that you already saw on page 1, for example.

The more complicated method, getting to be more popular nowadays, is also to use a `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, but instead of using `OFFSET`, you use a `WHERE` clause to return records where some field is greater or lesser than a value. For example, imagine a page size of just two records. When fetching page 1 you perform a query very similar to the one above:

    -- SQL
    SELECT * FROM widgets
    WHERE user_id = 123
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
    LIMIT 2;

    # Rails
    Widget.where(user_id: 123).order(:created_at => :desc).limit(2)

Let's say this returns two records. Imagine these are full timestamps and not just dates, too lazy to write out times.

- Widget A, created_at = 2018-06-02
- Widget B, created_at = 2018-06-01

To get the next page, the client doesn't ask for ""page 2"", instead it asks for ""records before 2018-06-01"". Typically this would be a query param `before=2018-06-01`. To get this page of results, the backend query will look like

    -- SQL
    SELECT * FROM widgets
    WHERE user_id = 123
    AND created_at < '2018-06-01'
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
    LIMIT 2;

    # Rails
    Widget.
    where(user_id: 123).
    where('created_at < ?', '2018-06-01').
    order(:created_at => :desc).
    limit(2)

Which will return another two records, and so on.

Make sure you have proper indexes for all the possible orderings used on this page, or else it doesn't matter one bit whether you use the offset/limit approach or this one.

This way is also a bit tricky in that your `ORDER BY` field damn well better be unique, or else you may miss records while paginating over them. For example, consider what happens if you have two records with the same created_at timestamp. The naive approach above could possibly miss one of them.

This is, in theory, potentially a problem with the offset/limit approach too but in practice much less of an issue because (1) the ordering your DBMS uses probably won't change between queries, but even if it does (2) it's super easy to fix simply by adding a second ordering field, so instead of `ORDER BY created_at DESC`, just do `ORDER BY created_at DESC, id` and you can guarantee the ordering won't change.

[Where I work](https://tonsser.com) we also used AMS for a couple of years but eventually ended up making our thing. Our implementation has the same API as AMS 0.8, so we could transition easily. [At plain serialisation our version is something like 30 times faster.](https://gist.github.com/davidpdrsn/a825732c41a6bbc4251952752fbe9819) It can be so fast by eliminating most of the features that we never ended up needing.

Another feature we really wanted was proper nested caching, similar to [Rails views.](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#russian-doll-caching) At least until a couple of years ago AMS had a very poor caching story. Caching is tricky but our implementation is pretty battle tested by now and we use it a lot.

ActiveModel_Dirty,"Good question. Here's a long answer because I'm bored and this seems like a fun one to write about:

Theoretically from a high level yes, if you wanted to make a site like that you would pull the information from an external source. But more importantly, no, you would not do it by hand; never do anything ""by hand"" in the context of programming. Or, more accurately, only do things by hand if it's in service of learning how you can automate the process in your code.

So now to the context of your application. It sounds like you're treating this as a learning experience and less so a business opportunity (at least I hope so), which is good because it's an example of an application that can scale in performance and ability as you learn with it. The first version can be written with very little programming experience (and will be absolute, barely functioning garbage from a practical standpoint), but it can eventually touch some of the most complex areas of web development if you decide to keep going with it to, maybe, a production codebase. But that's a long ways away.

I digress.

There are generally two ways of pulling data from an external source:

1. Via public-facing API (which would be the eventual solution for you)
2. Scraping the data (which is a more realistic place to start in this case)

Now, what's the difference?

You can think of scraping as your web application getting the information it needs ""by hand"". It's one of the most inefficient and cumbersome ways to collect data. Scraping is basically you telling your computer ""Go to this website and pull all of the html off of the page and send it back to me"". So it does that. It goes off into the internet, visits the site, and sends you back a really big, incomprehensible string of characters. To illustrate this, go over to the eliteprospects link and right click somewhere on the page. Click ""View page source"" and look at what it shows you. Now, every time you want to populate your database with new stats, you send your computer off to grab that file, and it gives it back to [you.](https://you.So)

So say I want to know how many goals Chris Terry scored during the 2013 NHL season. Let's assume we just magically know all of the urls to the website (although you wouldn't; this would also require engineering) so we know to go here to find that information: [https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/14370/chris-terry](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/14370/chris-terry). Now, we—as humans—know exactly where to look. We look to the middle of the page, we look for 2012-2013, and we find the ""G"" column to learn how many goals Chris Terry scored in 2013. When you think about it, it's actually quite a lot of steps. You have to look at several different things and find them on the page. It takes milliseconds, obviously, but it is several steps nonetheless—1. Find the link, 2. Find the table on the page containing the information. 3. Find the right row, column, read the information, etc. Think of all of those steps as an analogy for scraping. It's a series of basic, ""manual labor"" tasks.

Now, the corollary analogy for a public-facing API would be asking your friend ""how many goals did Chris Terry score in 2013?"". Now, they being the huge Terry fans that they are for whatever reason, respond back immediately saying ""One goal"". That is, at most, two steps: 1. Ask a question, 2. Receive an answer. In the context of your website, you can think of eliteprospects as your friend. An API provides you with a means of communicating directly with the EliteProspects databases where that juicy information is stored. Generally with sites like this, you don't even have to ask it a question, you basically just tell it once ""whenever literally any stat changes, let me know"" and it does exactly that from then on. So that means you could have continuously updated stats on your website, and you theoretically wouldn't have to do *anything* after writing the code once. They spit out data, you capture it and package it in whatever design you want, and share that with the internet—maybe you add additional features or you create a charting application that uses the data it gives you as a source--who knows, the sky is actually the limit.

So why not just do that? Why did I tell you you'll likely be scraping the data? Well, for one, APIs like this cost money in order to get them to talk to you. Their friendship doesn't come free. EliteProspects does offer a robust API, but even for non-commercial use it's going to cost you 200 Euros per month to get access. Likely not what you want to be spending right now.

So that's where scraping comes in. Scraping is free. However, many websites generally don't want you scraping them (especially when they offer an API, they want you to pay for that instead), and it is likely a violation of the terms of use you agree to by visiting their site. But that only becomes an issue at scales of greater than thousands of requests per day (or minute). When it's just you working and chipping away at code, nobody cares and you should not feel bad about it (also worth noting that not all websites care if you scrape, some are explicitly okay with you doing it).

So that's one drawback, the ethics/TOS violation of it all. The second drawback, which is arguably equally as important in some contexts, is the performance. Scraping is slow and annoying. Remember, it's a lot of manual labor steps for the computer. All *you* have to do is the initial set up and some maintenance here and there so it's easy coding, but the computer has to go through a series of steps each time it wants data, compared to the API that gets data without even asking for it. This, obviously, has major implications for site speed and the ""freshness"" of your data.

For using Rails, you want to check out Nokogiri, which comes with Rails by default. Here's a good tutorial that you can follow along with to get started: [http://www.mattmorgante.com/technology/webscraper](http://www.mattmorgante.com/technology/webscraper)

You are definitely on the right track, and that should be your first instinct as a programmer: ""can I cheat?"".

fiveguy,"I've been in a similar situation. **They know they're understaffed - and thus are shorting *you*.** They're going to have to pay (in terms of time) for being cheap and not hiring a properly sized team. This isn't an excuse to slack off - you are going to need much more time to learn the system and to write - you have to be more careful when developing since you are in isolation (no code reviews, etc). Edit: some of this post is about *managing expectations*.

Assuming the code isn't a complete mess, you *can* figure out the system, but it's going to take longer. If this isn't acceptable for both parties, bail and find a new gig before they fire you :)

Some tips for keeping your head above water:

* Subscribe to [Rails security issues](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubyonrails-security) (they're usually posted on this subreddit, too). You need to do this for every part of your stack. Security should be priority #1 (assuming you have anything of value)
* Look for problems using automated tools - linters, rubocop, etc. They may quickly point out some massive problems you may easily miss
* Don't be afraid to be behind in versions of tools and external APIs - as long as you are keeping up with security patches. For example, upgrading from Rails 4.2 to 5 (or higher) can be a massive time suck depending on your gems and just how old your legacy code is. 4.2 is still being maintained, so stay on it if you have to.
* Write tests for critical functionality as soon as you can. You'll get a better idea of how it works, and the assurance that it will continue to work as you mess with the app. If you need to, pad your hours a bit (on your assigned tasks) so you can take a few hours a day/week to do this.
* Whenever you touch code, add test for that code. Make yourself do it. Be disciplined.
* You don't have backup, you don't have a second set of eyes, you don't have someone to review code. So, try to keep things simple, and take your time. Don't get too clever.
* Don't be afraid to say ""I don't know"", or ""this [legacy] feature is a complete clusterfuck"" or ""it'll take longer than you and I want"" - but follow it up with ""but I'll figure it out"" or ""I'll make it happen"". 
* When you get that moment of clarity (holy crap, I finally understand this class!), if you don't have time to add tests, at least add some comments in the file (or outside the repo) to help you next time. I'll often very very lightly refactor a class in-place by simply renaming methods and variables to be more descriptive.
* Write good, readable code. If you have the luxury of hiring more people, their transition will be easier because of it (and those comments you added in the repo, in the previous bullet)

With this I'd simply react on option selects and let Turbolinks change the page to the new, filtered one. No further AJAXy behaviour to implement, still bookmarkable. By using Turbolinks there's no full page reload happening, so it still feels snappy.

Here's an example, erb:

```
<%= select_tag :type, type_select_options, id: 'type-filter', class: 'filter' %>
<!-- more filters here -->
```

And the JS:

```
$(document).on(""turbolinks:load"", function() {
  function applyFilters() {
    var filters = {};
    var type = $(""#type-filter"").val();

    if (type)
      filters[""type""] = type;

    else

  $("".filter"").on(""change"", applyFilters);

1. When the view renders, include that API data in hidden inputs in a form. When user submits the form (clicks save), that data is available (in params) in your next controller action. Disadvantage: the user could potentially modify the data in the DOM. Unlikely, but it's a common approach for bots and/or others who might want to fuck with you. Also, all that data is exposed in the DOM, which may not be what you want.
1. Store the data in the session, which persists (in the user's cookie), which you can access in the next action (or until you clear it out, or the user ends their session). Disadvantage: you can't store much data in the session.

I don't know your exact use case, but I am imagining fetching a list of repositories from GitHub that the user is searching for, and then the user chooses a repository to add to his account to track in some way.

In the case above I would create a `GitHubRepository` model, and upsert (create or update) GitHubRepository records when I fetch them from the API. That way they always have an ID in the database you can refer back to.

Then when the user wants to add the repository to their account somehow, you could model that with a `has_and_belongs_to_many :github_repositories` relation on `User`.

One important note that applies regardless of how you are loading configuration data... routes aren't reloaded automatically as a result of configuration values changing in development so you may have to restart rails or save `routes.rb` to trigger a reload to see the effect of changing a configuration value that is consumed in `routes.rb`.",1529855405.0

HellzStormer,"I would assume this is an example, but that your actual use case is that you receive params and pass them directly to your object's create. Now you worry that a random person can choose the id.

It used to be exactly as you describe (create, update_attributes, etc) ignoring the :id and other attributes by default. It changed in Rails 4 when they changed to [strong parameters](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#strong-parameters).

The idea with strong params is that you should restrict at the controller level which parameters are acceptable. This way the `id` doesn't reach the `create`. Basically, you say in the controller that ""It's okay to receive the height and the width"", and any other attributes are ignored.

If you want the old behavior, called [protected attributes](https://github.com/rails/protected_attributes), you might be able to get it from that gem. But it doesn't seem to be supported for Rails 5.

With it, you can specify a whitelist and/or a blacklist of attributes that you don't want to be assigned by mass assignment. This is how things were in Rails 3.2.

Your database is not your application. It's a storage system. Things like types, constraints, and foreign keys at the DB level are good for absolute requirements for data integrity. They're good for generating exceptions, which should only happen exceptionally.

Rails validations are designed to protect and help advise the user on errors, and are not exceptional, but common cases.

Having both for the same purpose is a code smell.

No controller, service, view, or anything else should talk to the database later directly. Need some database optimizations? Use scopes, joins, custom queries, or DB views on the model layer. Not all models need to be backed by AR:Models.

erandros,"I think these are very valid questions.  
But since these are many questions in one paragraph, I would ask them either in a newbie friendly ruby/rails chat room (such as a rails IRC, or a rails slack channel), or I would enumerate them like:

1) Is this what you call backend?  
2) What else can I do on the backend?  
And so on (I'm leaving two spaces at the end of each line to make the next line a new line, it's the reddit format ).  

To answer some of your questions, backend is a bit loose term.  
Nowadays it means the ""server side"", as opposed the frontend which is also known as the ""client side"".  
But backend also used to mean the ""admin"" part of a website where admins would log into and administrate their site (you shouldn't care about this, but know some [old sites](https://www.warriorforum.com/website-design/257578-what-does-back-end-website-mean.html) have this definition).

No, you can't just display your CLI tictactoe game because it's running in a terminal, and terminals can't easily be shown in a webpage (it is possible, in this case it would be very cool, but also very unusual and odd, so no).  

I liked the way you described erb tags as semi front end. Technically though, it's still the backend.  

In your case, think of the backend as the ruby/rails environment, and the frontend as the javascript environment running in your browser (js is practically the *only* programming language running in browsers)(also, javascript has nothing to do with java).  

Backends, or servers, don't necessarily need to be in a computer locked away in a facility. You could host your own server in your house, it's just more convenient to have a company take care of it.  

How do you write code that runs in remote servers? It used to be as nasty as writing the code in your own machine, compiling, and updating the binaries to the web server through FTP. Nowadays in modern normal servers, you write it in your machine, version it with git, and push it to the git repository of your web server, and the web server compiles on its own. Try **Heroku**, it has a free webserver/backend tier and Rails is a first class citizen there.
  
So no, you don't write the code on that machine, you just upload there the code you written in your own computer.  ",1529522150.0

toobulkeh,"To piggyback on /u/genericsteele:

I love all of their points on advice on how to find a job, except the last one. If you don't currently have a job, finding a job is your job. Spend as much time (up to 8 hours) a day looking for one (if you can)!

As far as value of work, as a hiring manager, I look for the following on a resume, in this priority:

1. Paid work history. It's a catch 22, but this is always the preferred experience to see.

1. If you can't get paid work, make sure the work you do is with other people (team work). Work in a bubble is next to nothing, as no paid work is in a bubble (someone is paying you).

1. I personally prefer work for non-profits (real users) over open source software (other developers). This probably has to do with my personal industry (consulting for non-tech startups), and may vary with other employers.

1. Open source software is still software that's used (hopefully) and shows teamwork. Don't just open source a pet project (that's next), contribute to existing open source. Become a T shaped person on that OSS -- understand the breadth of it, but specialize in a section of it and understand every detail.

1. Pet projects / personal projects. Something you did on your own - outside of a class / group requirement. Bootcamp class projects suck because your git history is often terrible and it's difficult (as an employer) to really know who did what, and why you did what you did.

Some other notes that might be worth while, in no particular order:

*  Polish the work that you're showcasing. Things like: Use good commit messages, explaining the changes and the reason behind the commits. Use PRs and Squash-Merge them. Rebase don't do merge commits. README documentation and build scripts go a long way to helping someone ramp up on a tool you've built. Make it YOUR work, not your team's / group project.

* Customize your environment. Dotfiles, automation scripts, preferences... if you don't have preferences, you're too fresh / don't care enough about your process. You should want to do this.

* Learn a little about a build pipeline / some ""DevOps"" stuff -- go through a deploy process -- document it or automate it. Any is better than having no knowledge of this stuff

* Research the job you're applying for. The recruiter (or first person you talk with) shouldn't have to explain what the company does or what team you're joining.

* Customize your resume to the job posting. Any keywords the job posting has, try to reflect them in your resume. If you can't, realize that that's a gap between you and the job. Don't list the kitchen sink. A technique I personally use (with a decade of experience now) is to have a ""master"" resume with as much detail as possible. It's about 20 pages long of bullet notes and paragraphs explaining things. Then I delete everything that's not pertinent to the job (down to 1 page) when applying. It's much easier to ""apply"" this way.

* Don't rate yourself on your skillset. These little ""progress bars"" in resumes are stupid. If you don't feel strong enough in a technology to sell yourself, then just don't list it.

* Find the job where you want to be in a few years. Find other people that have gone from where you currently are to where you want to be and learn how they did it. It probably won't be your exact path, but it will show you options you can take (when all brought together). It'll also show you some keywords to learn today

* Look at and follow some thought-leaders in the community you want to be in (all jobs are part of the ecosystem of communities). Learn their names and what they're known for. Start trying to see where they're headed, new technologies. They give this stuff away and it'll keep you ahead of the curve. Books are dead, Twitter is ADD, Conferences are great, Blogs are about as formal as we get.

G4rsid3,"don't do it! It's terrible. It will eventually bite you in the ass for so many bizarre reasons. Ex:

If you go to `/question/1/message/45` but `message#45` is actually under `question#2`, what should your system do? Break? 

It's okay objects have structure, but think of your application as you building little views into the objects you are storing.

It doesn't matter that `purchases` have `questions` to your router. Maybe in the future `messages` belong to `questions` and also to `refunds` and it's a shared association to the object.

What would you do in that case? have 2 routes, one for `/purchases/:id/questions/:id` and another for `/refunds/:id/questions/:id`? Seems janky.

Also gets super tedious to manage templates and you basically are just always wading thru shit. 

Also the above mentioned situation of multi routes makes the same appearance as the problem of you changing the structure in any way. As your system grows in complexity, you don't want to tie your router to that structure because it might not always be that way.

I guess the other way to say it is that these relationships and how you think about them are always subject to change. Especially for any reasonably complex system, the less amount of info you need to go somewhere the better it is.

let's say for instance you're a CX representative at your company here and want to look up an order someone is chatting you about, purchase #37121.

What would be better? Them being able to type in `/purchases/37121` into the URL bar or having to ask the customer if they know the order number also?

(Also yes I know you could built a little query interface that looks this up, but that's beside the point).

edit: source; did this before with a learning management system. regretted it direly as the system grew and changed. (we use to have subjects > topics > lessons > activities) and routing that matched that. when we wanted to go to add a second system of organizing lessons by tags, the routes got all sorts of complex, because the tag based lessons didn't use subjects or topics but pointed at the same lessons, so we had to re-invent a lot of wheels to get the `lesson` page to render as it's own route, which called into question the entire design decision for us of deeply nested routes, and we decided as a team we hated it!",1529382723.0

   * Process groups
   * Threads

      * Traditional certs (e.g. RapidSSL)
* PostgreSQL
   * Access control (pg\_hba.conf)
   * Replication
   * Backups
* CDN's (for storing user uploaded files)

Postpone automatic load scaling until you feel confident in more of the above. If you want to start managing many servers, you'll want some configuration management platform such as Puppet, Chef or Ansible.

Anyway, as stated, this is just improvised and therefore incomplete.

In regards to firewalls, I have never really gotten the fascination. If you don't want your applications to speak to the internet, don't bind them to the public IP interface, just use the loopback interface. ([127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1)).

I guess firewalls are useful if you want to block specific IP's or only whitelist specific IP's, but historically I have put that kind of logic at the application level. That way other developers (who don't mess with the servers) also have a chance of knowing what is going on in regards to blocking out users.

I also want to mention that the vast majority of ""freelance"" programmers are really contractors who are, for all practical purposes, just employees. They work the same full-time schedule as an employee, go to all the same meetings, get paid a similar amount, etc. The only difference is the compensation structure.

My goal when I started freelancing in 2011 was to find a client for whom I could work 20 hours a week in perpetuity. It took me until 2016 to find a client that was okay with fewer than 40 hours a week. Incidentally, I've worked for three other clients since then who have all been okay with fewer than 40 hours a week.

I will throw one more option in the mix here -- if you'd like to get to successful uploads of your assets _quickly_ and not deal with configuration, writing code around the library, etc, then check out [Shubox]. If you have an AWS IAM account set up for an S3 bucket, and don't mind putting a little javascript on your site, you can get stuff uploaded to S3 rather immediately.

I'm of the opinion that [send and public send](https://github.com/tkz79/naivebayesgender/blob/master/app/controllers/predictions_controller.rb#L17) should not be used unless absolutely necessary.

More [public sends](https://github.com/tkz79/naivebayesgender/blob/master/app/services/prediction_service.rb#L30) and these lines are a bit too long, helper functions would be nice.

There's a few places where you don't check for invalid arguments. For example you don't verify that [params has an entry for prediction here](https://github.com/tkz79/naivebayesgender/blob/master/app/services/prediction_service.rb#L11).

~~Big problem. [There](https://github.com/tkz79/naivebayesgender/tree/master/test/controllers) are [no tests](https://github.com/tkz79/naivebayesgender/tree/master/test/models).

[Slight typo, wikipedia spelled wrong](https://github.com/tkz79/naivebayesgender/blob/master/app/views/verification_tools/index.html.erb#L8)

Your check to see if the database is initialized relies on the [Classification model](https://github.com/tkz79/naivebayesgender/blob/master/app/controllers/application_controller.rb#L13). What if there is other data that isn't a classification?

You have built a whole part of the app to initialize test data, but perhaps you could have used the [seeder](https://github.com/tkz79/naivebayesgender/blob/master/db/seeds.rb) instead?

The [verification tool](https://github.com/tkz79/naivebayesgender/blob/master/app/models/verification_tool.rb) should be a service, not a model since it doesn't correspond to anything in the database and all of the methods are static.

You have a bunch of code marked with [remove me or disable me](https://github.com/tkz79/naivebayesgender/blob/master/README.md). You could potentially use the `Rails.env.development?` function to not require big code changes when deploying to production.

ActiveModel_Dirty,"I don't have a huge amount of time to get into specifics, but I do have some high\-level feedback for you, if that strikes your fancy. 

* In one of your controllers I saw something like: `SomeClass.all.map{ |c| [`[`c.name`](https://c.name)`, c.whatever] }` Instead, use [#pluck](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Calculations/pluck), which does not require loading entire objects into memory just to get a few attrs (and thus is way more efficient): `SomeClass.pluck(:name, :whatever)`
* The law of demeter, while not a hard\-and\-fast rule, is a great one to follow. There's all sorts of theory and speculation when it comes to what it actually means and why you should use it. I tend to just think of the rule as simply ""don't use more than one dot in an action"". For example, [`Person.company.name`](https://Person.company.name) while common, breaks the law of demeter. What that should *actually* look like is: `Person.company_name` where `company_name` is a method defined on `Person`
* A lot of your code is packed super closely together from a visual standpoint, and line length (80 characters is the preferred limit) does not seem to be a concern for you. For the sake of readability, I would spread it out a little so it's easier to discern what is happening in any given situation. 

Say you have something like:

`Person.do_something(some_argument: some_hash[:a_value], second_argument: some_hash[:second_value].to_i, time: Time.parse(some_hash[:timestamp])`.  

It can be really hard to keep your place while reading that line, especially if it's surrounded by characters above and beneath it.  A solution would be to go this route:

`Person.do_something(`

`some_argument: some_hash[:a_value],`

`second_argument: some_hash[:second_value].to_i,`

`time: Time.parse(some_hash[:timestamp],`

`)`

Another easy win is to break your methods apart by whitespace when they're doing a bunch of stuff.  Usually three distinct chunks are good enough. Each complex method usually follows a basic pattern of: set up, do stuff, return value. 

I tried illustrating, but reddit's editor makes it all look weird. Point is, whitespace as a linebreak between two distinct variations in logic are always appreciated. define your methods, linebreak, do some stuff, linebreak, close it all out with your return value or the last action the method should take.

There's nothing, in my opinion, overtly wrong about your code. But as an employer, I'm looking for someone that writes maintainable code that will play nicely with other developers be it now or in the future. This codebase just looks a little too much like it was written by (and for) one person.

Also, method documentation. Not so much necessary in your controllers where you have `#GET /classifications` above `def index` in `ClassificationsController`. Anyone can assume that's what that method does. 

More useful, is in your service objects and one\-off method definitions with complex logic. Usually I follow a pretty simple format for method documentation:

`# Public: Enqueues a sidekiq worker for scraping a given product listing.`

`#` 

`# listing - An instance of a product listing`

`# domain - the domain name where the listing originated (optional)`

`# account - An ID representing the account the listing is bound to.`

`#`

`# E.g. ProductScraper.scrape(listing, ""amazon.com"", 314)`

`#`

`# Returns a String (Job ID).`

`def scrape(listing, domain=nil, account)`

`#logic`

`end`

\- ""Public"" generally refers to public methods, ""Internal"" is the corollary to private methods.

\- A section that defines the expected values of any arguments you expect and whether or not they are required.

\- Example usage. Mine is a naive example, but how to call the method and ways it may be used are helpful here.

\- What the method returns. I.e. an Array, String, or Nothing.

How does the router workout which controller to call?
How does rails even know about your controller file?
Why do you need to put your files in certain directories?
Getting the gist of how all this fits together will make you much more comfortable with the framework and remove a lot of the magic.

If you haven't already really play around with and make sure you know how foreign keys relate models together. Get very comfortable with using join tables/models.
Also try and workout how you would go about reimplementing some of the model macros. How would you make it so just writing `has_many :comments` in the post model's class magically give instances of post methods like `post.comments` etc.

Also have a look inside the config directory and workout what the different files are for.

I always recommend beginners follow along with small tutorials that can be completed in an hour or two. And follow them to a T. Because if you mess something up you may not be able to fix it.

SminkyBazzA,"This is covered in the Rails routing guide, have a look at the following section to see how to restrict a set of routes to a particular subdomain, for example:
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#request-based-constraints

This would let you split your app into logical chunks, where certain paths only work (match) on certain subdomains.

To address another point you may not be clear on: each route has two helpers, one returns a relative path, and one returns an absolute URL. For example root_path and root_url.

Have a look at what gets put into your HTML and you'll see the first will output ""/"" and the second something like ""http://yourdomain.com/"".

I can't recall the exact configuration options but if you look in /config/environments/*.rb you'll be able to see where the default host (domain) and other routing options are set, and these can be overridden in your code at runtime, globally or as keyword options passed to your routename_url helpers.

A note on your Heroku example, I'm pretty sure they don't use www.dashboard.heroku.com, but instead just dashboard.heroku.com. It may work with the extra www, but that's more of a function of how DNS works. Not all URLs have to start with www, it's just a conventional default subdomain for a website.

demillir,"Your question is spot on.  Here's an overly simple explanation of how MVC maps to website elements:  


Models \- one per object\-oriented class in your architecture, including one class for each data table in your normalized database  


Controllers \- one per RESTful resource in your architecture.  A resource may comprise a single model, a virtual model comprised of associated models, or an atomic business process (e.g. an insurance claim filing).  More on resources below.  


Views \- zero, one, or many per RESTful resource/controller  


One way to architect with MVC is to focus on nouns in your application domain, e.g. account, claim\-filing, user\-registration, event\-venue, etc.  Prefer to proliferate nouns instead of verbs.  For example, rather than having many verbs that apply to an account (e.g. ""registering"", ""canceling"", ""transfering"", etc.), make a verb phrase that is a noun, e.g. account\-registration, account\-cancellation, account\-transfer, and then create a RESTful resource for each on those nouns.  If one of your nouns has more controller actions than the classic list\-of\-seven (index, new, create, show, edit, update, destroy), then consider splitting the noun into multiple, more specific nouns.

jibbit,"the other answers are spot on saying you are right:- you don't always need a controller + views per model, but playing devils advocate for a rounded take.. 

On amazon there absolutely is a page to look at all my orders, and then drill down to any individual order. Yes the orders also appear on other pages, but cancelled orders, pending orders etc. is the same page (/orders/show) with a different parameter (/orders/show/pending /orders/show/completed), so this is what the orders controller (if the parameter == 'completed', show only these orders, etc.) and views are for .

ShippingOptions is maybe a model that doesn't need a controller, but then again maybe it would be useful for customer support to be able to look at the shipping options given an order id (but 403 if incorrect permissions)? Or maybe it would be useful to be able to fetch/update just the shipping options via javascript for the frontend?

I have mine setup to not generate things like factories. If I need a factory I’ll create one when I need it.

Rails is very flexible. There’s no requirement to have a view and you can render in json for example, with no view. Or you could have a model shared by multiple controllers or maybe it’s used by another model. That’s entirely up to you and what you’re trying to accomplish. ",1528528731.0

I wrote a post the other day on attempting to relieve this by monkey patching the representations controller. In effect this would force Rails to return the content of the asset rather than perform an expiring redirect to it. This would allow a CDN (like CloudFront or Cloudflare) to cache the asset. It would mean that the initial request to your app is slower as it fetches and returns the file from S3 but it does alleviate the load of subsequent requests.

I've only used it in the content of representations/variants - I still require fetching the underlying file to go through an expiring redirect.

There is also an additional HEAD request to S3 before redirecting to the S3 object URL, to check whether the processed file has already been generated.

creativeintent,"As most comments aren’t trying to add any value, I’ll offer my thoughts from a UK-based perspective...

I’m a Rails developer and former CTO of 3 years. I ran tech for a London-based startup built on Rails and React.

When it came to hiring team members, we really struggled to find anyone with any reasonable Rails experience to join the team. Often we resorted to hiring great PHP developers that showed an aptitude for learning new languages and we’re looking for a new challenge. 

It wasn’t ideal, due to the initial learning curve, but it was a means to an end. 

Anyways, why is it so hard to hire a Rails dev? In my experience, most of the experienced developers are happily contracting. The UK has a thriving market for Rails contractors, particularly in and around London. 

We interviewed many experienced developers whilst hiring and more-often-than-not we found that they weren’t really looking for a full-time gig unless we could offer them a salary in the region of £100,000.

That’s simply no an option for most young companies and so you either hire a multitude of contractors or you retrain a developer from another language. However, we then found that these developers would eventually leave to work as contractors anyway because the money on offer is much more than we could ever consider. 

As much as it’s a PITA as an employer, it’s a great market for us as developers. So much so that I’m the end, I resigned as CTO and am now happily contracting (mostly Ruby and Elixir) myself!

wmjbyatt,"I'm an American Rails Dev who worked as a senior in the Gold Coast for about six months, and here are some of my observations. They're localized to the SE QLD area, I don't know if the generalize to wherever you are.

It seems that developer training in Australia is still pretty weak. Anecdotally (I can't find data), it really seemed like Australian universities are still designed to churn out engineers into mining-related industries first and foremost. QUT has huge and robust civil engineering, process engineering, and mechanical engineering programs, but there wasn't a lot of CS or software engineering presence on campus, and where it was, it really focused on embedded and systems development (again, for mining first and foremost).

On top of that, software really benefits from a strong startup culture, and I didn't see much of that in Brissie or Gold Coast areas. For example I didn't meet many people who were working on startups, and I didn't see a lot of startup-focused community resources (like coworking spaces and the kinds of workshops they tend to offer). Back stateside, a lot of the Rails devs that I know are people who learned Rails in order to launch some personal project, and either they exited or the project failed, so now they're looking for more stable work.

Third, there's a lot of really competitive options for the good devs out there (because the talent pool is so small). When I started applying for work in Bris, I had three offers inside two weeks, and I was able to negotiate up to a strong A$100k salary, *after* employer contrib to super, despite having zero Australian references for the employers to call. And this was at an established company where I genuinely wasn't asked to work a minute more than my 37.5 and I got all that freakishly enormous time off you Oz folks get--I don't know how the culture is for studios there, but in the States, you'd expect to have to burn past those norms for deadlines every now and then.

So that's just some thoughts. If you want to attract talent, you'll have to invest real money in them, and try to find ways to plug into the developer education pipeline, by either getting in close contact with a local boot camp (if there is one) and being willing to train juniors, or do the same thing at local universities.",1528386721.0

0x7E3,"You actually said every thing you need to know. You know this, it just hasn't clicked. All the Invite class does is serve to connect an event with an attendee. Each attendee gets their own invitation for each event they attend. So, an invitation has to track two things; it keeps track of which event it is for and which user it belongs to. You use the primary key (the id) from one of each of these objects to link them in the invitation. There are a couple of ways to do this. In the simplest form, you can simply assign them directly. Assuming you already have a relevant user and event object assigned:

`Invite.new(user_id: user.id, event_id: event.id)`

In your controller you might use something a little more direct:

`invitation_params[:event].invite.build(:user_id, current_user)`

Either way, the result is the same. So, suppose you want the User with the id of 5 to attend the event with the id of 3. You could assign `Invite.create!(user_id: 5, event: 3)`.

Even faster development speed?). Don't get me wrong, I love Rails, but developing on Rails right now is as much a game of what not to use as what to use.

janko-m,"When a file is submitted via a HTML form, the parameters including the file content are sent in the request body in [multipart form data format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST#Example). Rack, the webserver interface that Rails is built upon, automatically parses the multipart form data encoded request body and saves results in `request.params` \(just like it does regular POST parameters\).

However, since the file parameter has multiple information with it \(filename, content type, actual content\), Rack saves it in a Hash:

    {
      :name => ""file"",
      :filename => ""cats.png"",
      :type => ""image/png"",
      :tempfile => #<Tempfile:/var/folders/3n/3asd/-Tmp-/RackMultipart201-1476-nfw2-0>,
      :head => ""Content-Disposition: form-data; ..."",
    }

The file content is what gets saved to the Tempfile object \(which is very similar to a regular `File` object\). What Rails then does is it wraps this Hash in an `ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile` object, providing reader methods such as `#original_filename` and `#content_type`, while any other IO methods such as `#read` and `#size` are delegated to the underlying Tempfile object.

So, the purpose of the `ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile` class is to wrap the Hash of file data that Rack creates on file upload requests.",1527852126.0

* Naming convention.  Often overlooked and a few strong indicators of how maintainable someone will keep their code.  Good naming of model/classes/method/even variables can make a huge difference in debugging/refactoring.

* Size of code.  By this, I mean how big are methods/classes/controllers.  IMO a good dev will have a lot of extraction already done and if possible DRY to the point of reusing code where it makes sense.

* Infosec and privates.  Are they keeping their privates private?  Are they serializing info where possible?  Are they using public IDs for 3rd party interfaces?  These things could matter more or less depending on your business.  It could mean a whole lot with HIPPA info and not much at all with a stupid little game.  Still, it's a good indicator when someone does it regardless.

* Performance.  This is kind of a no-brainer.  From things like short circuits to maybe bloated ActiveRecord calls.  There are countless things here that could be taken into consideration.

* Metaprogramming, not even once.

* Polymorphism, if it makes sense, and they did it well, kudos.  On the other hand, if it could have been implemented obviously but wasn't, anti-kudos.

I do some work with a charity for a few month of the year at a heavily reduced rate. This client found me actually after I worked for an agency and did a bunch of work on their site, when I left they approached me (with approval from my previous boss) I accepted them as a client.

I also have my own personal side project with about 5000 users and about 4 years old now, it doesn't make much profit as again mostly used by emergency service volunteers it does cover its own costs.

The reason I recommend finding a side project, especially one like your own with at least a paying customer is you will learn so much more for example some of the things I have learnt doing my own side projects and taking ownership include:

- Managing code of a long period of time
- Living with your good and bad code

2. [This ruby wrapper](https://github.com/rapheld/pluot) to their API. It's a bit old (3 years) but having never used WA before, I'm not sure if that's a problem or not (Lots of APIs don't change in that much time). Even if it does, this wrapper may provide some suggestions on how to write your own.

That said, I would highly suggest writing an API wrapper and putting it into a lib place of your own app. While you're writing for WA right now, your org might decide to change to another Membership Management Software tomorrow, and you'll want to make the transition easy for your custom app. Putting it into it's own namespace will help delinate responsibilities in a domain-driven manner so there's a minimal interface you'll have to replicate for other replacement systems.

DerekB52,"I'm gonna say none. Vanilla HTML/JS and jquery is enough for you to build anything you need. Bootstrap is nice and you can use it. But I'd avoid stuff like vue and angular. The time spent learning one of these frameworks could be spent simply building your frontend in HTML/JS. And by building your UI yourself, you'll know what all of your code does, and won't have too many black boxes. 

You'll also know your code will continue to exist. Frameworks come and go and Angular or Vue could be dead in a couple years. React probably won't be dead, because of Facebook, but really anything can happen.

I'm not telling you not to use a framework, there may be one that you can learn quickly and will work for you, but you should really consider that you don't really need one.

homemadepecanpie,"As others have said Angular, React, and Vue are the big three right now (though there are plenty of other things out there). I think it really depends on how complex you expect your front end to become. Angular is probably the most complex and standalone of the three. If you are going to use Angular you will probably find yourself writing your entire app in Angular and just using Rails as a JSON API. Vue and React are much easier to just drop small components into an existing Rails app (though they can also be scaled up to the point the majority of your code is React/Vue).

In all honesty, you probably don't need to use a frontend framework for your entire app based on your description. You can probably get away with using mostly plain JS, but if you find yourself needing to keep track of state a few Vue/React components could probably help. I keep mentioning Vue and React together because they are very similar. https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html has a good comparison.

_matthewd,"The version that makes the ruby source most closely match your original query is:

    base = VolunteerRecruitmentStatus.where(""override_recruitment_process != 't' AND dbs_number = ''"")
    base.where(""(override_dbs_process != 't' AND dbs_number = '')"").
      or(base.where(""application_form_returned_on IS NULL"")).
      or(base.where(""(references_process_completed != 't') AND (reference_1_returned_on IS NULL OR reference_2_returned_on IS NULL)"")).
      or(base.where(""interview_date_at IS NULL"")).
      or(base.where(""induction_date_at IS NULL""))

The actual executed query will be messier (the first condition duplicated into each OR branch), but they're logically equivalent.

Closer to what you currently have, rearranging the order of the source yields a simpler query by putting the ORed parts first, and then applying the common conditions afterwards:

    VolunteerRecruitmentStatus.where(""(override_dbs_process != 't' AND dbs_number = '')"").
        or(VolunteerRecruitmentStatus.where(""application_form_returned_on IS NULL"")).
        or(VolunteerRecruitmentStatus.where(""(references_process_completed != 't') AND (reference_1_returned_on IS NULL OR reference_2_returned_on IS NULL)"")).
        or(VolunteerRecruitmentStatus.where(""interview_date_at IS NULL"")).
        or(VolunteerRecruitmentStatus.where(""induction_date_at IS NULL"")).
        where(""override_recruitment_process != 't' AND dbs_number = ''"")

Either way, once you have the ORs behaving, you'll probably want to hashify the conditions, e.g.

    base = VolunteerRecruitmentStatus.where(dbs_number: """").where.not(override_recruitment_process: true)
    base.where(dbs_number: """").where.not(override_dbs_process: true).
      or(base.where(application_form_returned_on: nil)).
      or(base.where.not(references_process_completed: true).yield_self { |x| x.where(reference_1_returned_on: nil).or(x.where(reference_2_returned_on: nil)) }).
      or(base.where(interview_date_at: nil)).
      or(base.where(induction_date_at: nil))

Finally, these are a lot of conditions, and they feel like they have some higher-level names that can be applied. Named scopes will help with readability and reduce the amount of detail piled into one ""line"":

    class VolunteerRecruitmentStatus ...
      # I'm obviously making up names here, you know your domain better
      scope :not_started, -> do
        where(interview_date_at: nil).or(where(induction_date_at: nil))
      end
    
      scope :references_not_completed, -> do
        rel = where.not(references_process_completed: true)
        rel.where(reference_1_returned_on: nil).or(rel.where(reference_2_returned_on: nil))
        # or use the reordering trick again:
        where(reference_1_returned_on: nil).or(where(reference_2_returned_on: nil)).
          where.not(references_process_completed: true)
      end

in0pinatus,"> how many of you here are self employed? 

I've been an independent consultant and contractor. I've also been a senior consultant in a successful boutique dev shop. Currently I'm running a startup I founded, and I'm the majority shareholder so you could say I'm self-employing, indirectly=)

> do you recommend it?

Only if you already have a good network and don't mind feeling quite alone much of the time. Contractors/consultants are often not considered ""part of the team"" so emotional resilience is essential. You also need a decent financial buffer for the downtimes; consulting income is pretty lumpy. It helps to have a supportive/understanding spouse/life partner who doesn't mind that I'm spending next week in Singapore or taking a conference call with Seattle at three in the morning. It also helps me a great deal to have a dedicated home office space.

>How do you score clients? What business sectors do you target or make apps for often?

I have a network of people with spending authority that've worked with me before and will ask me to help out or recommend me to others. The word-of-mouth recommendation is worth ten thousand cold calls.

I start from a default position of ""happy to work with anyone"" but apply black marks for unethical behaviour, harmful products, appalling culture and so on. I ruled out defence and big oil long ago, telcos and financial institutions are often borderline, and I tried government sector once and said ""fuck that never again"". Life's too short to give your waking hours to people or organisations you don't respect. Not everyone has this luxury, but good developers in first-world nations do.

> What are ranges you charge for a project?

I charge by the day. It's a *lot*, but I'm super experienced in multiple tech fields and can pitch myself as a CTO for hire, not just a developer. But even as an freelance dev I was always by the day. Fixed price work I think is toxic, the incentives are poisonous on both sides of the deal. Also note that even with the best market conditions you should anticipate considerable gaps between gigs and you're responsible for all your own insurance, training, travel, tax/regulatory compliance, medical, equipment, self-care and so on. You should overestimate these costs; the overestimate is always less than the reality.

>How much experience should one have before they even start thinking pursuing Rails as a freelancer / consultant?

You don't *need* any if you're supremely confident and spectacularly good at self-promotion. Then you might be able to get yourself in the door as a warm body keen to learn. That was me at fifteen when sheer gumption & hubris (and luck) scored my first casual programming job at a science education center. Your negotiating position is basically nil and you'll earn peanuts. You're doing it for the experience.

I didn't follow this path, but I've seen people find mentors at tech meetups that taught them the ropes of running yourself as a business. I personally didn't go freelance until I was thirty and had a professional network and some experience as a business manager.

CrimeInBlink47,"I wasn't going to answer this, but then I saw the answer from /u/inOpatus and figured it would be nice to throw another opinion into the hat.

I'm self employed for the past year and a half. I'm an individual consultant with my own 1 man LLC. I pitch myself as more of a generalist backend / DevOps engineer, but Rails is the first framework that I learned and is how I got into the industry. I look for work in Rails often, but have somehow only worked one Rails contract out of a handful or so. This doesn't mean Rails work isn't out there, just that I find a lot more DevOps and JS related positions for whatever reason.

Would I recommend it? Most definitely. I work much less overall than I did back when I worked in the startup world and that leaves me room to live well.

Scoring clients is all about network as /u/inOpatus mentioned. I have sent a couple thousand cold emails and got nothing. I've worked with all clients I have through mainly a small tight network of folks from the first startup that I went to. When you work tightly with people and you're good, they'll end up hearing about work and thinking of you first. I'll talk about this more in second. 

Rate. Again, the other guy nailed. Charge by the day, not by the project. I do charge by the hour as well, but I usually push for my daily rate as it is so much easier to track and bill. DM me and I'll tell you rates and what you can expect through different levels of your career. 

How much experience... this is where I'll diverge from /u/inOpatus. I'll agree that yes, you can start as a freelancer without any industry experience and get junior jobs for low hourly pay, but I wouldn't recommend it. My suggestion is to go to your nearest city, apply to a bunch of startups and get a job there. I say startups because they'll force you to wear a bunch of hats and you'll have to absorb knowledge like a sponge if you want to do well there. Hopefully you'll also get a mentor there. 2-3 years at a job like that will give you enough experience that you'll feel confident in your abilities and will give you a start to a good network if you play your cards right. Then you can become a individual consultant.

That was my route expect the startup I worked for got acquired, I moved across the country, became head of the project, and then started managing the team. That was all useful experience as well because now I can run a meeting like nobody's business and I can talk much more confidently about how certain things should run.

In fact, if you were to inspect the browser page of some of the javascript examples of this select field and strip it of its identifier, often times it'll just revert back to a simple select field with a multiple select attribute.

For example, let's say you were to use this JQuery plugin: [http://loudev.com/](http://loudev.com/)

If we were just trying to write the end\-result HTML after you had loaded that plugin, it would be:

    <select multiple=""multiple"" id=""avengers-select"" name=""avengers-select[]"">

and the JavaScript:

    $(""#avengers-select"").multiSelect();

ethboy2000,"Rails will automatically look for a NewsController when you define news resource. 

At the moment, that controller is uninitialised (because you’ve defined an ApiController).

Either rename the controller or tell the news resource to look for the ApiController instead.

Personally I would create an API namespace and then a version namespace within that. Then within that I’d have NewsController. So it would look something like

Api::v0::NewsController

If you want generic API methods available in all api controllers, either create a base controller within your Api::v0 namespace and inherit from that, or create a module that you can include in your controllers.",1526479893.0

mayorsan,"It's been 2 days since I've been working on this task and I wanted to share my progress and see if I can still get help from anyone out there. 

In my Task Model I still have this:
`accepts_nested_attributes_for :tasks_test_methods, reject_if: :all_blank, allow_destroy: true`

In my template form I have this:

```
= f.collection_check_boxes :test_method_ids, TestMethod.all, :id, :name do |box| 
   .form-group.row 
      .form-check.col-md-3
         = box.check_box
         %span.ml-2 
           = box.label
```

This was able to display the list of checkboxes in the browser. 
The Only problem I have now is how do I convert this into something that TasksController will accept and persist into the database?

The desired behaviour is this from trying in the console, this created the data in and I was able to get the test_methods for a single task by doing this:  
```
2.5.1 :176 > params = { task: { name: ""Test"", client_id: 1, tasks_test_methods_attributes: [test_method_id: 1]}}
 => {:task=>{:name=>""Test"", :client_id=>1, :tasks_test_methods_attributes=>[{:test_method_id=>1}]}}
2.5.1 :177 > task = Task.create!(params[:task])
2.5.1 :196 > task = Task.last
2.5.1 :197 > task.tasks_test_methods
  TasksTestMethod Load (3.8ms)  SELECT  ""tasks_test_methods"".* FROM ""tasks_test_methods"" WHERE ""tasks_test_methods"".""task_id"" = $1 LIMIT $2  [[""task_id"", 16], [""LIMIT"", 11]]
 => #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy [#<TasksTestMethod task_id: 16, test_method_id: 2>]>
```

I have no idea how to integrate this collection checkboxes into the field_for kind of format that is required for me to persist to the join table.
```
= f.fields_for :tasks_test_method, @task.tasks_test_method do |task_test_method_form|
  = task_test_method_form.collection_check_boxes :test_method_ids, TestMethod.all, :id, :name do |box| 
   .form-group.row 
      .form-check.col-md-3
         = box.check_box
         %span.ml-2 
           = box.label

First, why not use this as an opportunity to learn a JavaScript framework? You’ll have a new skill to use. 

Second, if you really want to go this route, keep the model layer, and use it as your interface with the api. Keep your controller for business logic.

dom_eden,"I have done something very similar in the last 2 months and it's working perfectly in production. I've edited for brevity and there are some code formatting issues with pasting into Reddit but here's how I did it:

**Frontend**:

Base Axios instance that API calls use:

`import Axios from 'axios';`

`const cookies = new Cookies();`

`const axiosInstance = Axios.create({`

`baseURL: '/api/v1',`

`headers: {`

`'Content-Type': 'application/json'`

`}`

`});`

`axiosInstance.interceptors.request.use(config => {`

`config.headers['Authorization'] =` `Bearer` `${cookies.get('user_jwt')}`

`return config;`

`});`

`export default axiosInstance;`

Example API module using the above instance:

`import axiosInstance from 'api/base';`

`export const getNotes = userId => {`

`return axiosInstance.get(\`/users/${userId}/notes\`\);\`

`};`

Example API call using the imported module above:

`import { getNotes } from 'api/notes';`

`getNotes(this.props.user['uuid']).then(response => {`

`// do something with response`

`})`

**Backend:**

In the Rails API, write a before\_action callback in a higher level controller that checks the JWT for every request. Make all your API controllers inherit from this controller.

`class Api::ApiController < ApplicationController`

`before_action :check_user_authentication_token`

`private`

`def check_user_authentication_token`

`begin`

`jwt_token = request.headers['Authorization'].gsub('Bearer ', '')`

`decoded_token = ::JsonWebToken.decode(jwt_token)`

`# Verify the user using the UUID in the decoded token.`

`@current_user = @user = User.find_by!(uuid: decoded_token[""sub""][""uuid""])`

`rescue`

`render(json: { error: ""Could not verify token. Please log in again."" }, status: 401)`

`end`

`end`

`end`",1526306906.0
multiplegeorges,"Are you sure you're correctly sending back the token in the `Authorization` header when you do the `fetch` to get the current user?

For the fetch API, making the header will look something like: 

    let headers = new Headers()
    headers.append('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)

A JS HTTP library like Axios can make this a lot easier.

Once you're authenticated, you need to send the `Authorization` header with every request you expect to be authenticated. The token in the header identifies the request as authenticated and identifies which user is making the call.

Is there a specific reason you are using JWT for authorizing your frontend?
Cookies can work just as well and might be a better fit for your use case.

hardwaregeek,"My suggestion is to store the jwt in local storage, then make part of the startup process (either with componentDidMount or something else) taking the token and putting it into the redux store or whatever you’re using. 

One combination Id suggest is graphql-ruby with Rails and Apollo with React. You don’t need to use it, especially if you’re not doing a lot of data fetching, but it’s really worth it if you need to do some complicated fetching logic, like getting articles with comments and users, or getting a store with their products and customers. Graphql-ruby is amazing cause it hooks right into activerecord so you can use activerecord relations as resolvers (basically if I ask for articles with comments in graphql, Rails will know what you mean and fetch the comments). Apollo is amazing because it makes fetching super simple and caches everything. ",1526268386.0

As far as storing it, this article is great and comprehensive. https://stormpath.com/blog/where-to-store-your-jwts-cookies-vs-html5-web-storage. Cookie will be simpler as its passed with each request automatically and on the rails api side you can check via `cookies[:access_token]`. ",1526276477.0

ActiveModel_Dirty,"Nope. There shouldn't be either. To address each point:

\>What kind of stuff is ok to put in models?

This really, really depends on your team and the way you want to work. I'm of the belief that the only thing that should be placed in models is things that relate to the behavior of the data for one instance of a model. I.e. validations and associations. Maybe a few methods that give you more detail about a model's behavior. I don't think that scopes belong on a model. Because at that point you are not working with an object, you're working with a collection of objects and the logic you're writing is actually query logic. So I personally think queries should be their own objects \(known as query objects or finders\). But the flipside of that is that scopes are chainable, and can be extremely convenient.

\>What gems are fine to use and which ones should be avoided?

There's no way to keep a catalogue of gems with reviews that make sense for your project. Each review would be biased towards the reviewer's use\-case and yours may be different. For example, I see absolutely zero reason to use a gem like Devise in a small application. It adds way too much overhead. For something small I'd recommend Clearance. Does that mean Devise is bad? God no, it's one of the most long\-standing and best\-maintained gems out there, it just does too much for certain use\-cases. An easy rule of thumb is to just visit the GitHub for whatever gem you want to use. If it has a \*lot\* of valid, open issues and nobody is actively maintaining it, maybe stay away. Otherwise, you're probably fine to use it. But every gem you add adds extra overhead and adds extra potential for breakage, so use them sparingly if possible.

\> What do we do when there is a really complex business logic?

There are tons of answers for this. If it's moderately complex, use a Service object. If it's so complex that it could be considered its own application, use an Engine.

\>In which situations is it fine to use concerns

I use concerns as extensions of models, where I put certain logic that affects the behavior of my interactions with models but not the data itself. For example, if you have a ""soft delete"" functionality in your application. A soft delete means assigning a kind of ""deleted"" classifier onto an object, but not actually deleting the object from your database. Usually this is done through a ""deleted\_at"" timestamp. I would use a concern to specify the logic that ""if this instance has a deleted\_at timestamp, we consider it, for all intents and purposes, to be deleted"".

But the reality is that these are just my opinions. Why should you listen to me? Because these solutions have worked for me in the past in the applications that I've built? I have no doubt that if you follow these patterns they can work well, but there could also be a thousand other patterns out there which will also work well for you. Who am I to say that you should do it my way?

The same applies to the people that are a part of the Rails core team. They have no grounds to tell me or you how you should be using your application. And moreso, it's actually detrimental if they do. If the people at Rails make a bad or inefficient decision, they may prevent someone from doing things a better way because they've set precedence for code reviewers everywhere to say ""Well, rails core does \_\_\_"". But the fact is the people who develop rails are developing rails. They're not developing your application. While it is their baby, they have no idea how people are using it and the solutions that will come to light from hundreds of thousands of other developers out there. They need to leave it open to interpretation, so it can maintain its flexibility and opportunity for evolution.

Truthfully, best practices are very nice. But practically speaking, you're going to have to make sacrifices to code quality along the way. Don't stress too much about doing everything the best possible way. Just do it in a way that works for you and your team. ",1526055879.0

lift_heavy_things,"> What kind of stuff is ok to put in models?

Business logic, but it's important to understand that under even a small amount of codebase growth you can get a lot out of using additional abstractions to just MVC. 

> What gems are fine to use and which ones should be avoided? And why?

This is as complicated as asking ""what kind of food is ok to eat?""  It DependsTM.  I read the majority of most gems I use.  It doesn't take long, usually about an hour, to get a decent sense of how the gem works.  

> What do we do when there is a really complex business logic? Where should it go?

A matter of taste, but if it only acts on a single model, it's usually fine to keep it in that model.  If it acts on multiple models there are various tools available to you that vary in structure from basically none (PORO/plain old ruby object) to things like the Interactor pattern.  As mentioned above, MVC is not the be all end all.  

> In which situations it is fine to use concerns?

Again, a matter of taste.  I personally don't love concerns because I think multiple inheritance is difficult to reason about.  I still use them very sparingly in places where there is a huge amount of duplication and not much change (change is risk when you have a ton of things coupled together).

Refactor complex logic until the behaviour arises from a composition of much simpler objects.

Use classes liberally and concerns (modules) in abundance to extract domain concepts. Invert dependencies with composition and injection. Remember than modules, like classes, are subject to the SRP, so make their boundaries by capability/scope of action, not technicalities like method count.

- What merge variables to interpolate. E.g. your marketing team might use the placeholder `Hello %FIRST_NAME%` and you can programmatically pass in the first name for each email. 

The header fully describes the email and the HTML / CSS is already defined in the template so Sendgrid will have everything it needs to build the email. The body/subject you send with the api call can be some fake value. 

PM if you have any difficulty setting this up.

However, I always recommend against this practice in general. My personal opinion is that the product/eng team needs to demand that email templates be defined in the application. If marketing really needs control over the email, there's numerous marketing management solutions they can use that don't require engineering's time and input. 

A few reasons -

1. Sendgrid uses different template ID's for staging and production. Managing this list of template id's across multiple environments will be trickier than you think.

2. Marketing will find this solution ""easy for them"" and will expand its use. Now you're working on programmatically managing 10+ email templates

3. Humans make mistakes and email mistakes are costly. Someone will type `Hello %FIRST_NAM%` and the template will break. A bad email will be sent to hundreds of users. You want things to be tested and programmatic, not at the whim of anyone who can change the template in a heartbeat

4. From a product design perspective, emails can get complex. Mixing in-app email templates with sendgrid templates will lead to a lot of code complexity (spoken from experience here). You also want to make sure emails are limited from a user's experience and that your product is focused on sending *product* emails, not *marketing* emails. Again, they can use their own software for that and manage it themselves.

I always thought it was the other way around. Ruby got pretty damn fast compared to several years ago, so it's probably a wash when you start comparing Python to Ruby.

Rails has way more development activity compared to Django. 

It's been a number of years, but last time I worked with Django I always was annoyed how its ecosystem was not even on the same level as Rails. Felt like I was building stuff in Sinatra. Maybe it's better now.

BaconGlock,"i recently went thru this quandry myself. i already knew a lot of python from working with flask for a couple years and needed a more feature-rich framework and django was the obvious choice but...man did i hate it. i really tried to give it a chance but it seemed like every single step there was some sacrifice i had to make (for example, the django template language is very limiting, they say it can be switched out with jinja but this is a joke as doing so makes it ridiculous and super hacky to work with contexts/variables/etc). by the time i got to setting up a way to merge all my css/javascript and serve them as one file, it became so painfully obvious that django just...isn’t fun for me. in almost every context, there is one or 2 popular add-ins that both quasi-do what you want but then fall short and you really have no alternatives besides just living with the annoyances.

rails was calling to me hard simply because it was doing everything just how i wanted (ERB, asset pipeline, file structure). everything was just well thought out and done in a way to make it enjoyable and productive without having to jank around with literally every little thing. i ended up making the investment to learn ruby, and then rails, and now i am further along in my project than i ever got with flask or django and its been a joy to work with.

so tl/dr; if you like having to fuck around with absolutely everything just to get it wired up and learn a dozen difference DSL’s for forms, for templates, for ORM, etc && do a ton of research to make sure the one of 2-3 popular add-ins is going to be the right choice to achieve the basic functionality you need && buy a $40 book (two scoops of django) to get the “best practices” way to setup your entire app structure that is totally different than the way django defaults to &&  having to subclass things like the built in user model of which you have no way of knowing exactly what the base class looks like && a dozen other similar types of nonsense, django will be awesome for you. if you just want a fun time sitting down and getting actual shit done in a super pleasant and well thought out and cohesive way, Rails is the top dog.

The only reason I'd start with Django is if I was building some special software that required easy integration with Python libraries (Python is much more prominent in math/science/stats fields than Ruby is).

Neither Ruby nor Django are particularly performant or scalable compared to other choices, however:

* Both Ruby and Python are interpreted, rather than compiled languages (Ruby is experimenting with JIT compilation, but it's far off, and even then it likely won't match native compile speeds). 

* Both Ruby and Python have Global Interpretor Lock preventing multi-threaded parallelism.

* Neither Rails nor Django have native support for the more modern performance or scalability oriented patterns, such as async processing (Node), actor model (Akka/Scala, or Elixir), or channels (Go).

If you need a highly performant or highly scalable application, consider some of the above alternatives. Note that they don't come for free both in terms of learning and in terms of complexity/maintenance for even an experienced developer.",1525891812.0

defmacro-jam,"> i would love to know your opinions

I find it easier to read and understand Python and Django -- and I find Ruby and Rails more pleasurable to write.

Django is getting a little long in the tooth and these days pretty much everybody uses Django Rest Framework for the backend and something like React for the frontend.

> it is not clear which one i should learn

IMO you should learn a little Ruby and a little Python -- just to see which language you like more.  Then go through the tutorials for Rails and Django -- to get a feel for which framework you prefer.

If this sounds like I am not answering your question, it's because I'm not.  I use both Rails and Django (though I do generally choose Django for personal projects because I prefer Django models as a starting point for exploratory programming).

For my next project I'm going to try Elixir and Phoenix framework.

> i have read that Django is more modern but rails is fast

This separation of concerns will save you a whole world of software defects and painfully leaky abstractions later.

Broadly speaking this is also how background jobs work. However background jobs have a particular lifecycle, which may not fit your intended uses.

ziptofaf,"I have tried both approaches actually - a separate front-end and back-end vs webpacker + react-rails gem. They both have pros and cons. 

Personally I have found the latter to be a really good solution when you have an already existing application. I couldn't justify rewriting easily 10000 lines of code and getting rid of rendering HTML in favor of JSON so React could function on it's own. However react-rails + webpacker combo lets me literally embed React components anywhere inside my application. Like for instance in the middle of the form generated by Rails cuz you need 2-3 fields with custom behaviour. That way I got the best of both worlds - routing, helpers, all necessary middleware (like Devise) handled with Rails and ability to create a live application with React. It also means less knowledge necessary to get React to work correctly - if these are all smaller individual components which are de facto serving as ""views extensions"" then you don't need to install 30 libraries and care about sophisticated state management and whatnot. Personally I do find Rails structure and convention over configuration approach to handily beat that of React environment at the very least. 

Building a separate application with React has the main advantage of being able to split your work - as long as you provide a decent documentation of your endpoints and parameters accepted you can pretty much focus on back-end alone and let someone else do the front-end (or the vice versa). Overall codebase size is visibly bigger but also easier and faster to test (concept of integration tests in Rails is now gone, it's just json after all, it doesn't even require a ""real"" web browser anymore).

Let's say I've got 2 models only, `Doctor` and `Specialization`

I could write something like:

`@doctors = Doctors.joins(:specializations).where(:specializations => { active: true } ).all`

and this would return an instance variable with all doctors who specialized in a particular area.

How do I extend the @doctors variable to hit the other models `School` and `Service` i.e. get all doctors who not only specialize in X, but went to school Y, and offer services Z?

# 1. Is search setup correctly?

Does it work? If it works, even with manual human intervention, then it's 'correct'. Does it scale? Probably not easily.

You continue on to ask the right question though -- You Ain't Gunna Need Scale ([YAGNI](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html)) until people start using it. Don't sweat it now, unless you just want to learn!

# 2. In the future, can the AI recognize foods from photos with this approach?

No, as AI/ML is a totally different approach / stack / database. Google offers this in a [no-coding interface](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) now on their public cloud, has ways for you to train new systems through [other interfaces](https://cloud.google.com/automl/), and releases a lot of this technology as open source. It's a fun experiment, great for a resume and future large enterprise work -- but most (99%+) companies and projects don't come anywhere close to needing these approaches. If you want to stay relevant in the work force, I'd recommend [learning this stuff](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro) in the next decade though. (I don't work for google, but they release a lot of good content! That advertiser $$!)

# 3. Can I autocomplete user searches based on their history and preferences?

Since you use [searchkick](https://github.com/ankane/searchkick), it has some cool techniques built in to support stuff like this. There's also plenty of other ways to [handle searches](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/rails_search) and other ways to [make recommendations](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/Recommendation_Engines).

One thing to look into is how you're creating the session to sign in the user. Modern Devise will not, by default, sign in a user on registration, nor even on confirmation. That means that you're probably manually hooking into the Devise controllers to override that behavior to sign in the user. If you're not doing it exactly how Devise wants, that might be causing the problem.

Here is what my confirmations controller looks like to sign-on on confirmation. I would assume yours should look similarly, and also be similarly in your registrations controller too:

    class ConfirmationsController < Devise::ConfirmationsController
      # GET /resource/confirmation?confirmation_token=abcdef
      def show

Ronald-Ray-Gun,"If I had to guess, the `_attributes` is what tells Rails it should treat those params as described in `accepts_nested_attributes_for`. As opposed to a column on the parent model.


`cars = Car.new([{ color: 'black' }])`

`Garage.new(name: 'Home Garage', cars: cars)`

Rails handles this no problem, since it's got *instances* of `Car` and it `belongs_to :garage`.


But if you're submitting a form, you'd need...

`accepts_nested_attributes_for :cars`

`garage_params = { name: 'Home Garage', cars_attributes: [{ color: 'black' }] }`

`Garage.new(garage_params)`

That way it can turn those attrs into instances of the `Car` model.

I'm not aware of any packages to handle this manually. I've just modeled my forms to include `_attributes` OR you could filter through your incoming params in rails and append the proper names. A bit of a hack, yes, but the `accepts_nested_attrs `seems to be mostly catered to Rails' form helpers.
",1524892418.0
in0pinatus,"> Also, does anyone know why Rails requires params to be named that way?

It is because the mechanism works by creating a special setter-like method called `yourmodelname_attributes=` which is called like any other setter by methods such as `#update` when you pass them attributes to set. So the parameter name is chosen to specifically match the special attributes-handling setter's method name. 

If you alias that `_attributes=` method to some other setter-like name you can use that instead for your nested form parameters. However I don’t think this qualifies as “better” unless you’re trying to mask the fact that it’s a rails app, or implement a specific predefined protocol. Note that you can’t just name it after the association directly because ActiveRecord creates and uses that setter already for regular assignment.

seriouslyawesome,"I personally am not a huge fan of naming things like `assigned_to`, because an ""assigned to"" is not a noun that can have properties or attributes like a ""name."" If your `ServiceRequest` model belongs to two different users in different capacities, you could do something like this:

    class ServiceRequest < ApplicationRecord
      belongs_to :requester, class_name: 'User' # requester_id in your table
      belongs_to :assignee, optional: true, class_name: 'User' # assignee_id in your table
      # ...
    end

Then when you start referencing the association elsewhere in your code, it will read like `service_request.assignee.name`, which IMO reads much more naturally than `service_request.assigned_to.name`. 

On the other side, you might have something like this:

    class User < ApplicationRecord
      has_many :service_requests, inverse_of: :requester
      has_many :assignments, class_name: 'ServiceRequest', inverse_of: :assignee

So now your user model is referencing the `ServiceRequest` twice, but with context-aware names that properly distinguish the service requests that the user requested vs. the ones that have been assigned to them.

Your issue is that you don’t have an editor set. You need to either set it in a config file for your shell, or just pass it in like the line above. ",1524691658.0
ignurant,"Hello,

Do you possibly have `EDITOR` set to `editor` by chance? Or a string that starts with it like `editor hotdogs!`? The message you are receiving is what you'd expect to see if you tried executing `editor` from the command line. You can see your current env vars by executing `env`: take a look at what may already be set there.

The easiest way to set an env var in Windows is using the GUI. I usually just type `env` in the start menu, and select `Edit environment variables for your account`. You can also select the system env vars, depending on how saucy you feel (and your environment in general).

In the GUI, select `New` and name it `EDITOR` and for the value, use the Browse File mechanism to find your favorite editor. Some small changes you will want (need) to make: Your editor probably has a ""Wait for the file to close before returning"" option. This waits for you to actually edit and save the file, instead of immediately resuming. You probably also need to wrap the command in `""`s (but not the flags). It's much easier if you happen to have your editor on your path.

As an example, mine would look like this:

    ""%PROGRAMFILES%\Sublime Text 3\subl.exe"" -w -n

Except I have `subl` on my path to open it quickly, so for me, it's actually just

    subl -w -n


Aside from the GUI, you can also set it from command line. There are two commands you could use: `set` and `setx`. `set` will affect only the current shell session, and `setx` saves it more permanently. Sadly they have slightly different invocations. 

    λ set EDITOR=""%PROGRAMFILES%\Sublime Text 3\subl.exe"" -w -n
    λ rails credentials:edit
    New credentials encrypted and saved.

I've always had issues related to getting the quoting right when using `setx` so I just use the GUI for permanent settings.

Unfortunately, if you do not have the quoting and filename exactly right, Rails will still display this ""success message"" but it's a trap! You will not have actually seen the editor, and no message to make you think it went bananas.

Finally, there is very little magic what is actually happening here. The line that actually powers this is [pretty straightforward](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/commands/credentials/credentials_command.rb#L51)

        def change_credentials_in_system_editor
          Rails.application.credentials.change do |tmp_path|
            system(""#{ENV[""EDITOR""]} #{tmp_path}"")
          end
        end

As you can see, it's literally just calling whatever that ENV var is set to, with a filename. Knowing how Rails is invoking the editor should help you understand how to appropriately set the `env` var.",1524708727.0

Your team / managers set this deadline with a certain amount of developers, and you lost one. Don't beat yourself up. Look at it this way: you lost an important member, and you have the opportunity to show how valuable you are by picking this up.

Now, Devise is terrific. It's crazy easy to install, it's tried and true, and used in many massive web applications. Another day when you have more time you can build your own auth system, but for now just go with Devise. Its GitHub page has all you need to get it going.

As far as authenticating w/ react on the client, there are lots of guides out there and I'm sure you'll figure it out.

Senior devs have tons of experience and, naturally, a large network. Many I’ve met can usually land a job prospect through word of mouth during their lunch break. 

I remember hearing somewhere that about 80% of job openings are filled this way and the following 20% rely on postings on job boards, recruiters, etc.



So what if you targeted junior developers instead?

There are many companies whose development work doesn’t require reinventing a wheel yet still have problems finding the right developers. 

They may not be convinced that a junior dev has the necessary skills solve their problem, or maybe they can’t budget for a mid-senior level developer salary. If they choose wrong, they could blow their budget and not have much to show for it.

Frequently, employers don’t even know exactly what they need or what they should be looking for when hiring a developer.

I’ve been paid by a venture capital firm to help their portfolio companies without tech founders vet junior dev candidates, it’s a long and annoying process, but without help they can find themselves with a bloated and messy unrecoverable codebase (I’ve also been paid to try to fix those).



On the flip side, there’s a large amount of junior devs who are very talented, resourceful, and quick learners but don’t have experience to show for it.

Without experience their best option is to simply write a list of programming languages they’ve used (maybe once) and hope someone comes along with a position that matches a random tech stack like “Rails, MongoDB, and AngularJS”. 

It’s a total crap shoot and it takes a lot of work for junior devs to differentiate and get real experience.

Many go to coding bootcamps not to become better developers, but to leverage the bootcamp’s network and get their foot in the door somewhere.



I’d seriously consider focusing your efforts on creating a different kind of site that can help junior devs show off their abilities, and help them communicate their value to companies in a way that a business can clearly see the ROI.

Start by contacting 10 employers posting jobs on job boards and ask them their 3 biggest pain points during the search process. Start innovating there.

It could manifest to a job board that shows off candidate’s sample apps, code challenges (described to employers in plain English and why a solution is better than others), courses to level up devs, etc.

I’m clearly just spitballing ideas and rambling at this point, but a lot of companies are salivating for a better solution than giving a recruiter a handful of buzzwords to do a LinkedIn search for.

Ronald-Ray-Gun,"> I only wish to incorporate specific things from angular into existing views, etc.

From my experience, this isn't one of Angular's strengths. It's a more full-fledged single page app framework. The reason running `ng new app` gives you a ton more than you expected is because it comes with its own build process which can include complex things like source maps, typescript compilation, ahead of time compilation, server-side-rendering features, etc. Some of these things are more tuned to be run on their own Node server.

Now, this doesn't mean you can't use the two together, but if your goal is to keep your existing rails view code and sprinkle in some components (I use react-on-rails for this), I don't think that's feasible. Other libraries are much more suited for this, like React or Rails' own Stimulus framework.

If, however, you'd like to have some views be Rails generated (perhaps an admin dashboard) and others be a SPA (public user pages, cart checkout, etc) you can split things that way. In this scenario you'd essentially have 2 sets of routes: Rails' and Angular's. I've used this exact setup for a Rails + Ember application. Unfortunately, I don't know how it would be done with Angular -- my current company's setup is a Rails API + a separate Node server running Angular.

I used it through the beta. There were a lot of pain points but I figured they would smooth out. They didn't. Our team built out a full piece of end\-to\-end functionality with it \(with Rails\) and at the end concluded it just isn't good tech. Extremely difficult to use, verbose, heavy and broken in may places. I honestly can't say enough to discourage people from considering it. Personally, I would recommend sticking with 1.x over using 2\+.

In the end we made the choice to move forward with Vue. Template wise it is similar to Angular 1.x, which is handy for those familiar with it, but simpler, but at the same time it is also smarter, faster and easier to use. It also has some great tooling.

smittles2003,"2 things - as mentioned above, writing the CSV to a temp file and then returning that (or streaming the CSV response) should reduce overall memory usage. I would also look at not instantiating each Order as an ActiveRecord object. Because you are calling ‘read_attributes’ on them, you shouldn’t need any of the helper functions that AR provides - you’re literally just trying to get volume out of the database. Something like:

‘’’
Columns = [:codigo, :ubicacion, ...]
Order.where( conditions ).pluck(*columns)
‘’’

That will give you an array of arrays (each containing the value of the column in the database) in the order you specified in the columns variable. You can then write that to CSV, etc. 

Also, if you’re in Postgres, I believe it has a function you can call to automatically create a CSV - that’s probably going to be even more optimized than any Ruby code. ",1524359033.0

Maybe add a `GC.start` at the end of the request to force Ruby to release the memory.

Is it the CSV or the Excel that’s causing the problem?

Think of it this way. Every time you use a Hash, a fairly complex algorithm finds the value for you, every time you allocate a new object, a fairly complex algorithm finds some free memory for you. Understanding the consequences will give you a good foundation.

Anyway, I've never been a big believer in having to be able to write good algorithms even though it is a part of old school job interviews.

gelfin,"So not to pick on your use of terminology, but if you’re talking to other developers it’s going to come up: the way you’re using the term “algorithm” is a little off.  In short, you don’t “solve an algorithm.”  The algorithm is the solution, not the problem.  An algorithm is an explicit step-by-step process for solving a problem.

For a given problem, say, “sort this list,” there are a LOT of algorithms that will solve it, with different performance characteristics in terms of time, memory usage and so forth.  For instance, this is a working sort algorithm:

1. Shuffle the list randomly.
2. For every item but the first, test that list[n] >= list[n-1]
3. If not, repeat from step 1.

I hope it’s entirely clear that this is in fact a *terrible* sort algorithm, but you could implement it in a computer program and it would (eventually, sometime within the lifetime of the universe) produce the correct result.  It’s just that practically any alternative you could come up with would be better.  If you can appreciate why that is so, then you can appreciate why computer scientists study algorithms.  It gives us a common basis to talk about how a given solution will perform, and to compare solutions to select the best approach for a given execution environment.  We often use the term “algorithmic complexity” to refer to a rough estimate of how much work needs to be done to produce a result relative to the size of the data.

Particularly as a novice developer, you aren’t likely to need a highly formalized understanding of algorithmic analysis to do your job, but it definitely helps to informally recognize when you can solve a problem without walking a whole list multiple times for every item in the list.

As for something like CodeWars, most of what that does is sharpen your skill for solving problems *at all*, which is something any developer needs.  Learning how to assemble a Rails app is one thing, but pretty much any real project that does something useful is going to have a few interesting problems to be solved under the hood.  Think of the difference between implementing the Google home page and implementing Google *search*.  The former is an hour job; the latter is beyond the capabilities of *almost everybody*.  As a beginner, doing CodeWars will start to develop your instincts for identifying problems, breaking them down, and knowing the tools at your disposal to solve them.

What I wouldn’t necessarily suggest is comparing your solutions to the top performers for any given exercise right out of the gate.  You’ll sometimes see solutions that are difficult for even very experienced developers to tease out how they work.  As a novice that can just be baffling and frustrating.  You’d learn more by comparison with more middle-of-the-road solutions that you can understand without too much effort.",1524149316.0
Serializedrequests,"Most real-world programming jobs have much more to do with organizing complexity, clarity, and maintenance of said complexity. I see it much more as a writing job than an engineering job. I have hardly ever used anything I got from my degree, except the unit on multithreaded code, and *maybe* the hardware understanding I got from assembly and C programming.

That said, the reasons you want to know about algorithms are:

1. To know what solutions to hard problems are already available.
2. To understand the performance cost of the libraries you are using.
3. To understand how fast certain database operations are.

Most real-world applications are usually IO bottle-necked, i.e. waiting for the database or network. You can write really shit code that allocates dozens of more arrays than it needs to and have it never be a problem in a Rails app. Where you will get into trouble is doing too many slow database queries.",1524156767.0

dvogel,"Algorithms are programming boiled down to it's essence: trade-offs between time and space (aka CPU and memory). The reason that sorting algorithms are the quintessential example is that sorting has so many possible combinations of those trade-offs. That's why we have so many sorting algorithms. Most other areas have two extreme choices. E.g. you can count things in the database or fetch every record and count them in the application.

Evaluating these time vs space trade-offs is required in every form of programming. Simple 1992 HTML authoring required considering how long it would take a page to be downloaded and rendered. For example, breaking an image up into multiple pieces allowed them to be downloaded and cached separately. If one section of that larger image had to be updated the browser would only download that section. Yet, tracking multiple images instead of one required more metadata storage and more CPU time to parse the extra HTML. This is a crude form of programming (the browser is like a strange virtual machine) but even here these trade-offs have to be made.",1524146964.0
Kuhnmeisterk,A lot of these answers hit some good points but the most important in my opinion is minimizing effort.  Algorithms have been studied forever.  Not just when computers were built.  Algorithms are tools to solve a specific type of problem.  The usefulness of knowing algorithms that are commonly used is avoiding trying to repeat coming up with a solution to a problem.  In fact many algorithms would be nearly impossible for you to come up with on your own unless youre a genius.  And the geniuses who did come up with them spent a long time finding them.

gelfin,"Disclaimer: My Rails-fu is about a year out of date, so I have not worked with ActiveStorage itself.  But this sounds like a REST problem, and it seems like you’re on the right track with the direction you’re going.

Ignore ActiveStorage for a minute and think about how you’d do this with a regular subresource.  Depending what you need, you might need to implement some nonstandard routes.

This ought to be the simplest operation to purge one attachment:

DELETE /resources/:resource_id/attachments/:attachment_id

That route would cover the case in your gist, but you might want some nonstandard routes:

DELETE /resources/:resource_id/attachments[?query]

You’d implement this much like you would with query params on an index method as a search/filter.  The only gotcha is on an index method calling the endpoint with no query params would return *everything* where you’d want the equivalent delete method to delete *nothing* in the same circumstances.

If you want to purge multiple attachments across multiple resources, that looks like it might get hairy.  In REST logic, just the fact that you’d want to access attachments independent of their controlling resource suggests attachments should have a top-level controller, and then support a query string in which :resource_id *might* be included as a value.  But it looks as if ActiveStorage might make it hard to implement something like this:

DELETE /attachments?created_at=<2017-04-17T00:00:00Z

(URL encoding omitted for clarity.  Also, I pulled a query syntax right out of my butt, but you get the idea.)

At a cursory glance it appears that might be tricky to implement using ActiveStorage, since there’s no true database relation there, and you might not even have metadata like that in the first place.  If you need something like that, my gut tells me what I’d end up doing is making a proper attachments table containing attachment metadata, attaching the ActiveStorage blob to *that* as a has_one, then giving it a belongs_to :resource.",1523972811.0

Depending on your application it may also be unwise to have single-role users; surely some buyers are also sellers? I know when I last bought a property I also sold one to fund it.

I recommend write your ideal Pundit code first, then implement the domain model to suit this. This intention-revealing approach always helps me shape my implementation ideas.

I might want to write:

    class OrganisationPolicy < ApplicationPolicy

I'll always ask the Role about the status of its granting to a given user. Not the other way around.

So for me the initial structure would have a STI Role model class with grant lookup by user that returns a Grant object that we can query. Including possibly an InvalidGrant that returns false for `valid?`.

The simplest I'll go is that User `has_many :roles`, although a richer and more flexible model has `users`, `grants` and either one STI `roles` table or (actually my favorite) one table per role class, with polymorphic reference from the grant. 

This isn't quite the same as Rolify because Rolify models each role as a table row not a class. This conserves the number of rows in the `roles` table but I find that a bit anemic since to me a Role isn't just a label, I need somewhere for role-specific logic (with Rolify this gets pushed up to your service layer), and I also want to include metadata on the grant itself like expiry or created_by.",1523926761.0

Basically, you should be checking the user's session on each request. Gems like Devise and Clearance will do this for you once a user logs in and out. If you're rolling your own authentication system (which I don't recommend), you'll need to add some kind of hooks to check the session on each request.

1. Yes, you need to do something like:

    current_user = User.find_by_id(session[:current_user_id])

2. Session info is stored in a cookie, within the browser, so they would not be logged out of other sessions. If you wanted to log them out, you'd need to save session data to the database.

jb3689,"> My issue more specifically lies in a case where a user has multiple tabs open (all on the same account) and they decide to log out from one of the tabs. The problem is on the other tabs- the user is still regarded as being signed in. I believe the key to fixing this is verifying if the session has been destroyed before performing actions and redirect the user to the login screen if the session was destroyed.

The first thing I would do is check the session cookie each tab has. You have access to the server, so you have access to the secret and can decrypt the cookie if need be (say if a random string was added to each payload before being encrypted). Are the session tokens the same? If so then you're not properly invalidating sessions

> 1) How do I go about checking sessions in rails? I have seen examples using sessions(params [:user_id]) but it doesn't seem clear to me how this works and how sessions work in rails.

Each application is different, but there is usually a database backend (usually Redis or some RDBMS). This article explains it pretty well: https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/how-rails-sessions-work/. You should probably take a look at your middleware stack (see `rake middleware` for which module to dig into)

> 2) What happens if the same user is logged in on multiple computers? I think that there are different sessions for different browsers so does a user have multiple sessions or are sessions just linked to a specific browser?

Generally speaking different browser instances have different cookies and thus different sessions, but it all depends on the implementation. Tabs generally use the same cookies (incognito does not). In order to support multiple concurrent sessions on multiple devices you need a session strategy that allows for this (i.e. you can't just have a `current_session` token on your User record or anything like that)

If you're really interested in sessions, I highly, highly recommend reading The Web Application Hacker's Handbook. It has an excellent overview of how sessions work, what their vulnerabilities are, and the challenges associated with designing session management as well as how to do it correctly and safely. OWASP has some good articles on sessions as well, but I recommend them as supplementary material for specific questions.

Rails is actually not terrible with Timezones. Check out the tzinfo and tzinfo-data gems. 

I'd recommend having the user pass their timezone to the server so that rails can do the conversion, otherwise you'll have to rely on some JS to do it and thats not nearly as nice (read: run, screaming). Once you have the time and the timezone, you can convert to and fro using the tz-info methods.

Essentially how I've handled it in the past is.

1. User submits local time and timezone.
2. Convert time to UTC and save in DB
3. When user wants to view the time, ensure you know their timezone (ie save it to the user model). 
4. Get the time from DB, convert it back from UTC and send it to them.

markrebec,"OK, so you've ruled out DB queries, and you've verified that converting the object to JSON (using the built-in `as_json` method) in a console is ""fast"" (at least fast enough).

That leaves a few options. Maybe there's a slow serializer library overriding the `render json: ...` in your controllers. Or maybe there's a JSON view for this route that iterates over the object(s) and tries to load association data (resulting in more queries that aren't generated when just calling `as_json`).

Is there a `app/views/campaigns/index.json` template? If so, look through that to see what additional data it might be querying and try preloading that with `includes` on your associations.

Does this project use any serializer libraries? I'm betting the app might be using something like [active_model_serializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers), which could be the source of the problem. Similar to the view mentioned above, look around for something like `/app/serializers/campaign.rb`, and see if it's defining/serializing any additional attributes that might be triggering associations to be loaded or additional queries to be executed. Again, preloading some of your associations might help speed things up a bit.

As someone else mentioned in the main thread, it's also possible that at least a chunk of the time isn't being spent in ruby at all, but in transport. If the JSON data is *huge* it might be taking a few seconds for the client to load the response over the wire.

Question to ask is really - what kind of application are you building and how specific are your needs? I personally don't think twice on throwing bootstrap and text editor via gems to my codebase if I am building a CRM system. I will be spending PLENTY of time on actual logic, not going to battle (and then remember to update them) with integrating such things manually.

If you look at high profile Rails applications like Discourse:

https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/Gemfile

Their gemfile is quite big. That is an application with front-end being de facto separate written in Ember.js meaning they don't need to use much helpers in this regard baked into Rails. 

Now, if you looked at GITLAB's source code (which is one of the bigger Rails applications out there):

https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/Gemfile

Wohoo. 445 lines of gems. 

So ultimately most projects do use libraries when it's applicable. Don't go into NodeJS territory however, you don't need a library for 4 lines fo code ([I wish I was joking](http://www.haneycodes.net/npm-left-pad-have-we-forgotten-how-to-program/)) but when it's something that will take you a while to develop and then requires additional maintenance - sure, check out existing gems first. 

At the end of the day it's up to you to decide. I would choose a well maintained and documented gem that solves a problem I am encountering completely over my code any day personally. But the opposite holds true too - I won't use a gem if it requires shitloads of customizations to fit and seems to be rather unpopular in the first place since this means I will sooner or later need to fork it and keep it updated on our company's repo and that kills the point.

tjdracz,"Apartment is great for SAAS type of websites where you are running multiple versions of the same thing from one codebase.

Using just foreign key works out fine for smaller-scale data fencing but can get fairly convoluted when you scale up. Apartment is kind of set-up-and-forget type of thing. Scaling can get difficult and it all depends on MySQL/Postgres/whatever situation you're running.

I've worked on the apps built in both ways and I do prefer the gem route. The problems I've seen with the apps that tried to roll their own solutions:

* default_scope everywhere (big no, it's great until you don't need it, which is more often than not)
* global variables to figure out what the current tenant is (even bigger no)",1523477680.0
hcsteve,"There's pluses and minuses to a shared database for all tenants vs a separate database or schema per tenant. It really depends on your application and use case.

Shared database

* Single database to manage
* Schema changes are easier / faster
* Low overhead to create a new tenant

Database per tenant

* Can backup/restore per tenant at database level
* If you have multiple instances of the application (say in separate datacenters) it's easier to move a tenant from one DC to another
* Security ""story"" is easier to understand for clients

I'm in the process right now of moving a fairly large app from a shared database to a database per tenant for the reasons outlined above.  FWIW, it's looking relatively simple so far to move in that direction (from shared database to database-per-tenant) by just copying the full database to each tenant's copy and then running a DELETE WHERE tenant_id != this_tenant_id (or doing a tenant.destroy with cascading deletes if your model associations are set up right).  Moving in the other direction would be a lot harder, especially if your associations are based on auto-increments - your foreign keys would almost certainly conflict if you try to just do a straight database dump/import.",1523481130.0

etagwerker,"I'm using it for a client project (SaaS in the education space) in production and it works quite well. It might be considered ""over-engineering"" depending on the context. 

As u/hcsteve said, there are pros and cons. The pros that I like the most: 

- There is a clear separation between SaaS clients. You need to try really hard to fuck up your code to end up with a record in the wrong tenant. 
- There is a simple Rack middleware you can use in your application. No need to reinvent the wheel there. 

The down side is that there is some weirdness when you have records in the public schema which are related to the tenant schemas. ",1523485983.0
ActiveModel_Dirty,"I use it regularly for clients that have a lot of clients of their own. It's great for these purposes because you don't have to worry about scope as much. Calling \`Post.all\`, for example, from within the context of a tenant is will yield the same result as \`Post.where\(tenant\_name: ""example""\)\` without the Apartment gem. 

If your codebase is large enough, that sort of thing can dramatically reduce the amount of things you need to think about each time you're creating new things. ",1523501983.0

systemnate,"The bad:  If you are deploying using Heroku (with Postgres), the backup utility cannot easily handle backups with many schemas (past 30ish or so IIRC).  It's another dependency to maintain (maybe you want to update to Rails 5.2, but support does not exist yet).  Maybe there is a use case not supported by the gem that is hard to work around.



The good:  I've found several good tutorials online that go into setting this up (even with tests).  Once it is setup, you don't really have to think about anything.  Once a user signs in, their ""tenant"" gets set and after that doing something like SomeModel.count will always be scoped to that tenant/subdomain without you having to really ever think about it.  It would be extremely hard to do something where data can ""leak"" over from one account to another.



With that said, if I were starting a new app, I'd be more inclined to either roll my own or go with a solution that scales a little better.  This is probably largely due to just growing as a developer and feeling more comfortable with Rails.

I used to avoid multi-tenant database architecture when creating new software, thinking that the added complexity of handling individual schemas wasn't worth the trouble, but these days you're really not going to complete the sale of technology into a healthcare organization (at least in the US) without the ability to offer separate databases for each customer.

Additionally, I think the usage of an authorization gem like CanCan(Can) or Pundit becomes infinitely less complex with multi-tenant database architecture.

I agree with most of the comments here saying that this kind of database segmentation isn't necessary for 90% of applications, but from a healthcare vantage it's all but required these days.

jasonswett,"> I am a relatively new to development

If you're new to development, it's hard enough just to learn Rails by itself. In addition to the Rails concepts (e.g. ActiveRecord, view rendering, etc.) there's Ruby, databases/SQL, servers, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Even if you're already comfortable with all those things, it's pretty hard to throw testing into the mix. When I first got started my question was, ""What do I even test?"" Do I write unit tests? Integration tests? View tests? Controller tests?

My advice would be to forget about Rails for a little bit and just practice testing Ruby by itself for a while. Then, once you're comfortable with testing Ruby, it will be easier for you to go back and try to write some tests in Rails.

> What is your recommendation on if I should focus on rspec vs minitest?

A person could make technical arguments for either. Deciding which testing framework to use depends on your objectives. If you're teaching yourself testing to become a more marketable developer, then I would definitely recommend RSpec. Almost every Rails project I've worked on (20+ production projects) has used RSpec. Having said that, it's less important which tool you choose and more important that you have a solid understanding of testing principles. I personally chose RSpec and I'm glad I did.

Here are some testing resources I often come across:

modnar42,"I’ve helped a few companies migrate off heroku and I’m not sure there’s a typical way. The best answer depends on the motivation for moving, but here are some thoughts. 

Many of the heroku add ons are dead simple. For example, when I last checked the sendgrid add on basically just added a text file with your api key. Not much migration necessary there, just some work in getting independent accounts and figuring out the format of the relevant config files. 

In my experience, Digital Ocean is generally more user friendly than AWS or Google Cloud. They have a specific focus on ease of use. OTOH they have far fewer features, which puts more of the service migration in your lap. For example, AWS has a hosted elastic search service and has providers in their marketplace that will just add to your bill like Heroku. 

AWS has basically every option under the sun, but it’s complex. I can’t tell if you’re familiar with AWS, but I’ve seen many experienced devops people fall into the “which services do we use and how do we compose them” trap and spend a lot of time there. It helps if you’re already opinionated about the AWS services and have some basis of automation. If not, expect choosing AWS to suck up more time than you’re hoping it will. 

I mentioned Google, though I’ve never used it for a production system, in case you’re cost sensitive. They contact my company once a year and offer _huge_ discounts to migrate to them. On paper many of their services seem better for less money than AWS. They have a wide service offering and marketplace like AWS. Depending on your circumstances, pressing them for discounts could offset some of your migration cost. 

tl;dr The easiest/best way depends on a bunch of stuff, so I rambled on.

ImageProcessing is a gem with awesome helpers that make it super easy to resize and process images. If you're using an existing attachment gem like Paperclip, you're probably just using whatever resizing helpers that the Paperclip folks wrote.

But the goal of ImageProcessing is to create a shared set of helpers that any attachment gem can utilize. That way, we keep things DRY and every attachment gem author doesn't need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to resizing images.

Also, in this new version, ImageProcessing has added support for resizing images with the libvips library -- which can resize images 5X to 10X faster than ImageMagick.

jryan727,"I often add an app/services folder and toss service classes in there (that's probably where I'd put your Twitter and Facebook classes).  

When I have a specific kind of class that's heavily tied to my application's domain, I'll sometimes create a folder specifically for them under app/.  For example, I have an application that sends various SMS text messages, so I have an app/sms_notifiers folder.

You don't want app/ to become a junk drawer, so I personally set a high bar for what should be nested directly under it.  On larger apps, I'll heavily organize app/services and place a lot of classes there.  

I make heavy use of form objects on complex apps, so I'll stick those in app/forms. 

After many years of writing software, I can tell you that the best answer is whatever is most easily understood by you and your team and most easily maintainable.  You can reach for all sorts of patterns and search for specific ""rules"", but the bottom line is that every application is somewhat unique, and you can feel free to customize its layout a bit.

I also mention most basic ways of ensuring private information don't go inside log files and what you can use for auditing (but it's not implemented yet). 

Frankly it was nowhere near as bad as one might think. The only breaking change is per-row encryption (since it pretty much means you can say bye bye to any fast lookups unless you also separately store hashes, all kinds of database groupings are also going to be broken) and there can be situations when you get away with NOT relying on it (although it heavily depends on your backup policy and it's not like you can just leave this data lying around forever in plain text). 

So if you are building a brand new application that has to adhere to GDPR then overhead needed is relatively small (my MockOrder model shows pretty much everything needed to get it compliant with GDPR once you have your core logic done and it's like 10 lines of code total). This can get much worse in existing applications however, you will need a clear list of which field holds personal information, how long can it exist in the database, do some profiling to see how performance changes once you add encryption (AES is fast enough to ignore it in most cases but turning O(1) lookups into O(n) can be destructive) etc. Still, hopefully this is of use to some of you.",1522824700.0

janko-m,"> I want everyone on the website to be able to listen to the audio files but no one outside the site (so i dont get killed with charges).

In this case setting public-read access is probably not what you want, because that would allow users outside of the website to listen to the audio files, if they're able to get their hands on the S3 URL to the files.

I think what you probably want is to stream the audio files through your app, and add authentication/authorization before the download. That way you can keep the the private access, because every time the audio file is requested the app will generate a new expiring S3 URL to download from, but only authenticated/authorized users will be able to access the audio files.

I don't know if you're using any file attachment gem, but with Shrine you can use the [`rack_response`](http://shrinerb.com/rdoc/classes/Shrine/Plugins/RackResponse.html) plugin, which does all the heavy work of streaming, handling [range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests), and setting the correct response headers for you.

If you're using something else, you can still use Shrine just for this functionality. The following example should work:

    # config/initializers/shrine.rb
    require ""shrine/storage/s3""
    Shrine.storages[:s3] = Shrine::Storage::S3.new(
      access_key_id: ""..."",
      secret_access_key: ""..."",
      region: ""..."",
      bucket: ""..."",
    )
    Shrine.plugin :rack_response

    # app/controllers/audio_controller.rb
    class AudioController < ApplicationController
      # ...
      def show
        # ...
        uploaded_file = Shrine::UploadedFile.new(""id"" => s3_object_key, ""storage"" => ""s3"")
        file_status, file_headers, file_body = uploaded_file.to_rack_response

        response.status = file_status
        response.headers.merge!(file_headers)
        self.response_body = file_body
      end
      # ...
    end

tadrinth,"Either stream the file through your website server, or redirect users to a presigned expiring url. Latter is more performant.",1522678128.0
worldDev,"So the key to your issue is knowing that your rails server has access to the s3 resource and your users do not.

To have full control of auth in rails, you would need to load the file into rails, then serve it to the user after auth, but this is terribly inefficient.

To have full control like that in a reasonable manner, you would ideally use a media server, in a messier manner you could be creating aws permissions for each user individually and try to manage it all through the AWS api but this would be a bit of work and seriously bad if you did it wrong granting permissions to your aws account.

A half way solution is to use expiring presigned tokens for access. This isn't fool proof and a link could be shared for a short time, but that may be a reasonable risk to ignore depending on the case and your priorities. The presigning of urls happens when you want the expiry period to start (on url request usually) rather than on upload as you mentioned, so you may need to go back and review the documentation on how to accomplish that. The flow of that goes... user asks rails for link to file > rails asks s3 for token that will expire in x seconds to resource > s3 gives authed rails server token > rails gives user presigned url with received token.",1522692378.0
jryan727,"As others have noted, if the S3 file is public, then the whole Internet can access it. Not what you want. 

You could stream the files through your application as others have noted. That would solve your problem, but it’s harder to scale and removes many of the benefits of using S3 in the first place. 

The way I’d solve this is with [S3 pre-signed URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html). 

When your user wants to access an S3 object, it asks your application, which asks S3 for a pre-signed URL for the object. It then passes that URL back to the browser, which it can use to directly request the object from S3. The object is only directly accessible by your application (it’s not public). The pre-signed URL is public and grants the holder of that URL temporary access to the object. The key is that you can set the pre-signed URL to expire.  Yes, the user could share the URL with someone else, but it’d be short-lived (relatively).

This approach puts minimal load on your application and lets you continue enjoying all of the perks of letting someone else host your data.  ",1522698810.0
djfrodo,"As others have said, use presigned urls.

Basically you get a token that's good for x number of hours, which let's you access the file.

After a week, it expires, but RSS feeds really don't need more than that.

The first solution would be to scale your database hardware up, so it would not slow down due to the heavy load. This is a quick and easy solution, and probably cheaper than the engineering cost to maintain a complicated optimized process, but that depends on your situation of course. The downside of this solution is that at some point it might start breaking again and you would have to scale again.

In my opinion the only proper solution is to work on a mirror or snapshot of the database. So you provision a separate database, that you keep up with all the changes of your master database, and you use that mirror for querying your newsletter data. I admit that's a bit heavy handed, but the result will be that it's impossible for your batch operation to have performance effect on your regular users experience.

For example, Micropost.all will get you all of your created Microposts.

But yeah, basically what I believe is that sqlite does not need to be spun up and run like PG, MySQL and Mongo... It’s just documents saved in a certain structure that you can query using SQL queries... But active record takes care of that.

I consider myself intermediate level as I haven't had the opportunity to get much mentorship yet. All of my personal projects are at linode (with Capistrano and Passenger) since I am not a fan of heroku pricing, and prefer not to support A to the Z. Heroku however does deserve some props for helping me get projects deployed in the early days of learning. I'm using postgres for all my projects so far, and also Bootstrap for the front end, though will likely replace it with something leaner soon.

I have three of my own projects so far... 

The CMS for https://sexinfo101.com (NSFW). A site I started back in 2001 in flat html originally. Eventually moved on to Drupal... which started out as a blessing, but ended up being a curse... especially after the fork of drupal that integrated with vBulletin died a couple of months after I adopted it. One of my main goals when I started learning rails was to build my own cms for it... the new site launched in Oct 2017 and it has become a pleasure to work on again. It includes a simple forum with a custom avatar system I made that lets user combine 4 image layers to make a custom avatar for themselves, a bucket list / checklist to help people keep track of what they've tried, their favorites, etc... and a lot of 3d rendered illustrations of sex positions and better sex guides.

My newest project is a social bookmarking site that just went into open alpha a couple of days ago: https://webmarks.org  It allows people to collect bookmarks and optionally share them with the rest of the community. Members can follow other members, or just certain folders. I was inspired to build this because of all the censorship happening by the gatekeepers... 

The last that is currently public, http://sagetube.com, is a site that extracts my fav youtube guitar teachers into a stand alone site so that you can search for guitar lessons without all the rest of youtube getting in the way. It isn't very pretty, and has been getting neglected for the past year, but a few friends and I prefer using it over youtube directly when having guitar sessions.

I'm open to all feedback... the only question I have at the moment is more on the JS side... Webmarks is using paperclip with papercrop (a wrapper for jcrop)... It works great on desktop, but it isn't responsive... so kind of a pain to deal with on mobile.

How about notifying users of changes to something they care about? Or creating an object to represent a concept that involves multiple database tables? (Could be a decorator or Domain Model.)

thibaut_barrere,"It's hard to provide a full answer just based on available information, but roughly you have many different ways to achieve what you have in mind.

Some families of ways to handle this:

* ETL (Extract Transform Load) -> extract from CSV, during the process transform / clean / remap any field, if you don't do incremental reload you could also dedupe in the transform step, then load a ""clean dataset"" into either Postgres, ElasticSearch, etc
* ELT (Extract Load Transform) -> extract from CSV, dump right into ES or PG (mostly unchanged), then modify there (or query a ""temporary dataset"" to do a sort of ETL, clean / filter etc, and pour the data into a more ""final"" destination in the same datastore

What's the most adequate way to do this depends on various factors:

* Do you want to deduplicate inside a single CSV (which can be achieved in memory before loading), or cross-CSVs (in which case you need a business key, with unique constraint, and do ""upserts"", or at least verify if you must drop the rows by checking id presence before)
* Do you have many different CSV formats or are them quite different? (if they are quite different, it's often more easy to go ETL, to have a very flexible & well tested way to verify the mappings & conversions etc)
* Are the outputs mostly largely similar with a bit of different fields, or mostly completely different?

Finally, here are some tools which can help:

* My own gem https://www.kiba-etl.org (which I use both for ETL & ELT scenarios)
* Ruby Sequel https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel (which is actually used by my upcoming Kiba Pro offer for database related tasks)
* pgloader https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader
* embulk http://www.embulk.org/docs/

Well, Elasticsearch can handle a *lot* more data than Postgres. In my current job we're using it to handle time-series data, and we receive about 500 million new records each day. It's true that in our situation query optimizations are just a never-ending task.

But with your tens of millions of records in total Elasticsearch should have absolutely no problem handling that efficiently. Count queries are also much, much faster.

Another way and i wish someone had told me so earlier is to stop marketing yourself as an individual software developer but to team with a designer, a solid front end dev or two and may be another backend dev to present yourself as a small dev shop that can tackle a project from start to end (even better if someone in the team has some de ops expertise). Finding your first client won’t be easy but you’ll land better/bigger gigs than what you would have as an individual and you’ll be able to markup your hourly rate by at least 30%. One last thing and it goes the same as a solo dev or if you work in a team and this is to NEVER accept fixed bid projects unless you need that to bootstrap your consulting business and in that case be ready to work for free toward the end to finish the project and make your client happy.

The authorization/ability for Update might say, ""If Document is in X state, User must have Y role to edit"", but I think the logic handling ""This is automatically approved"", ""This requires 'Bob'"", ""This requires ""Alice"" needs to be handled at a higher level.

So a User uploads their document. Part of the processing involved should be ""Does this require authorization?"" and then stamp the appropriate state on it.

On the approval side, you might consider using scopes so that either Bob or Alice see corresponding documents that require their approval.

blueflame9t9,"I think you should stick to building the simplest solution first, which is a form POST that validates quantities only on checkout, and shows a flash error message if the quantity was recently depleted.

I think you're underestimating how hard this feature is to build (I'd estimate 15x to 50x more time to build than a simple flash message on checkout POST as I described). I think you're also overestimating how important this particular feature is. If this is something a product owner or designer thought of, I'd send strong pushback their way.

The scenario you're thinking of, is not going to happen more than once in a very very long while. And even if it does happen, the business impact is nil in the simple solution. Your system shows an error on checkout because of 0 quantity in the database.... So really you're never going to have any business impact because of the problem (i.e., the restaurant's customers will never get affected... And the waitstaff are internal, so they won't really mind seeing the error on checkout as long as your UX and messaging leading up to that point is appropriate). Therefore it makes no sense to predicate your architectural choices on this edge case.

And also, once the qty hits 0, you can grey out that item on the menu, so the waiter can never select it until replenished. The waiter won't have the problem you described more than once per replenishment.

If you observe how waitstaff place orders, it's highly unlikely that two waiters will place the same order at the same time for an item. Its MUCH more likely that they will access the system a few minutes apart, at which point your system will show a greyed out menu item to the 2nd waiter because the 1st waiter has already depleted the stock.

TL;dr: don't worry about the case you're describing.

nielsbuus,"I have been trying a few times to adopt webpacker on new projects in favor of the asset pipeline in an attempt to adopt what appears to be the future.

However, each time I have ended up thinking ""this cannot be serious"" and I ended up postponing the adoption, because it felt clunky.

First of all, when I install something through npm, it seems to include a astounding chain of dependencies. I tried Bootstrap 4 and I believe I ended up with thousands of node modules taking up hundreds of megabytes.

I feel like you must take a leap of faith as a developer to adopt this. With such a complex dependency chain, it seems difficult, if not unfeasible, to audit the code or determining if the authors are trustworthy. And as the dependency version requirements are often open ended, you really have little chance of tracking what is happening when you bump your assets.

Comparing this with dropping a set of assets into the vendor folder once and seeing what you are adding, it really feels like giving up a lot of control for an untangible benefit.

On top of the swirling torrent of dependencies, it also seems that webpacker/yarn itself is harder to get set up with than the asset pipeline. Of course it may boil down to familiarity with your tools, but the asset pipeline comes with Rails when you bundle install, while webpacker requires you to manually install yarn and webpack in recent versions behind the scenes and as such, adds additional steps for setting up the project on a new dev machine.

It's plausible that I would feel more confident about webpacker, if I did a real nodejs project, but so far I'm so accustomed to Ruby on Rails, that I have no idea why developers are jumping to Node/ES6 in droves.",1521377778.0

At my current job, we have a couple of highly front-end projects.

An institutional site, with some data coming from our main project. And an SPA using an API provided by this main project.

Since the main project is a Rails app, we created those other two project as rack apps. And to manage assets(JavaScript, CSS) we use Sprockets.

But if you use a node.js app I'm not sure if Sprockets will fit your problem.

By the way, if you got interested in how we do this. On our rack app, we added two methods to concatenate and minify those assets and serve them at /assets/javascripts/application.js and /assets/stylesheedts/application.css. Actually, those methods are very simple:

    def javascript_include_tag(js = 'application', options = {})
      if ENV['RACK_ENV'] == 'production'
        asset = self.sprockets[""#{js}.js""]

They would replace the operations (and parts of reform) of TB.  
Personally, I wouldn't use either of them over TB, they still add complexity, but don't offer too much over self-written stuff. YMMV of course.

If you want to start simple: create POROs for your ""operations"" with 2 public methods - initialize and run (or call, execute, apply, process etc.). Put your logic in them, create / execute them in your controllers.  
Call them services, workflows, procedures, operations, scenarios, whatever.  
try to put no persistent state in them - let them do their thing, return some sort of result (`true` / `false`, model / nil, small result object).  

This fulfills a number of your criteria: it shouldn't slow you down much at all, it's simple, fairly maintainable and easily unit testable.

If you would like to research a different approach, look into DDD. The [Arkency book](https://blog.arkency.com/domain-driven-rails/) should make for a good start, with the [original DDD book](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/) giving quite a bit more background information.

bhserna,"In my team we have this 5 rules that help us to...

* Keep our business rules clear and separated from Rails
* Make changes fast and with confidence
* Delete code with confidence
* And have fast tests

1 - We try to keep all the business rules behind module functions...

We prefer to use module functions as the interface to our business logic, because there are times when the logic is so simple and there are times when the logic is very complicated. And this let us to decide if we should use an object to solve the problem or just 
writing some lines of code, case by case. 

An example of some functions of a module that we have could be...

    module Projects
      def self.admin_projects_list(projects_store:, instrument_translator:, date_formatter:)
      end

      def self.publish_project(project, current_time:, projects_store:, project_status_cacher:)
      end

      def self.teaser(project, translator = nil)
      end

      def self.rates_for_project(project)
      end

      def self.status_for_project(project, current_date = Date.current, from_cache: false)
      end

      def self.add_termination_date_form(project)
      end

      def self.add_termination_date(store, project, params, project_status_cacher)
      end

      # ....
    end

2 - Call this functions inside Rails controllers/jobs/models/mailers...

Something important is that we try to not call functions of nested modules... so we can call `Projects.publish_project` but NOT `Projects::Publisher.call` or something like that. This is important because this help us to change and delete code with confidence.

3 - In this modules we don't have a direct dependency to Rails stuff...

We can include libraries like ActiveModel or ActiveSupport but all specially all ActiveRecord or ActiveMailer clases should be injected dependencies.

    class ProjectFundingTerminationsController < ApplicationController
      def destroy
        Projects.revert_funding_termination(
          project_id,
          projects_store: Project,
          receipts_cancelator: ReceiptsCancelator
        )
        redirect_to admin_projects_path
      end

      # ..
    end

4 - All our tests are through this module functions

So we are going to test this functions just like the Rails components will use them.
We don't test directly internal clases or methods. This is what let us refactor without changing our tests.

5 - We don't use active record in our tests

This is because thanks to it we have very fast tests, and because we try to be explicit about what we are using from active record.

We do things like...

    before do
      @user = user_with(first_name: ""Maria"")
      @project_one = project_with(
        fixed_annual_rate: 11,
        execution_date: Date.new(2015, 10, 8),
        investments: [investment_with(amount: 100_000, user: user)])
    end

    def project_with(attrs)
      FakeProject.new(attrs)
    end

    def investment_with(attrs)
      FakeInvestment.new(attrs)
    end

    def user_with(attrs)
      FakeUser.new(attrs)
    end

    class FakeInvestment
      attr_reader :id, :date, :user, :amount, :user_id, :project, :project_id, :investment_type

      def initialize(attrs = {})
        @id = attrs[:id] || SecureRandom.uuid
        @date = attrs[:date]
        @user = attrs[:user]
        @user_id = attrs[:user_id] || user && user.id
        @amount = attrs[:amount]
        @project = attrs[:project]
        @project_id = attrs[:project_id] || project && project.id

If these files are required for running tests, I think it's a very poor choice *not* to put them in the repository, where they're safe and can be versioned along with the tests that use them. If you have to change a test, and/or change these files, now you've got version misalignments, just to save a little repository space (but no actual disk space).

Then I can write tests that verify that when this class gets a hash of data, it saves that data to a database record. The fact that the data originates from a CSV is irrelevant at this point.

mrPitPat,"I just started a new rails 5.2 app and i'm glad this was brought up because i've had some recent feelings on it.

On the one hand.. i love rails. I love developing apps in the full rails stack. I think it takes away from the enjoyment when I have to use a front-end framework like React or Angular. Nothing against those guys.. i'm a big react fan. But if I have an app that needs heavy react, i would just do it all in React and have the app digest an API (possibly from rails). Integrating react/angular/vue in an rails app kind of takes us away from the rails ecosystem (no remote: true for easy ajax on forms anymore unless you want to handle ajax:success on your own). Respond_to's everywhere mudding up my controllers, or a completely different set of API routes.

But on the other hand.. it really rubs me the wrong way to send js from the server. Personally, I hate the js.erb technique and anyone that's never used rails for anything looks at you like you have two heads when you explain how to add a new Todo from the list. Not saying it's a bad technique, just personally i'd rather digest json.

I want a powerful javascript front end capable of managing state, ajax, etc.. while also being tied in completely into the rails workflow. I was hopeful that Stimulus would be that bridge, but it still requires you to use the js.erb techniques for server side requests (unless you want all the setup work i mentioned before along with something like fetch or axios)

Maybe it's just wishful thinking.

Serializedrequests,"I don't recommend doing this. Having worked on codebases that did this all the time (and currently working on a really nasty one), I can tell you that the issues are 1) maintainability, and 2) security.

1.) Generated code is hard to debug, period. It's worse if you mix languages, and using Ruby to generate JavaScript to generate HTML is a complex mix. I could barely follow your example until I read it a few times. And now that I know what's going on, I can still tell you that you will not have fun if it breaks and you have to debug it. You sacrifice easy understandability of what JavaScript is being executed and how to work on it with this kind of code.

I have nothing against serving snippets of HTML from the server, and using client-side code to inject them into the page. If you don't need a front-end framework, this old-fashioned technique can be a great time-saver for appending a row to a table or updating an element. **Go SPA if you are doing anything complex.**

2.) Most sites nowadays should be using a content security policy. If you are using a CSP header, you have to allow ""unsafe-eval"" for your script-src policy. Maybe it's not a big security hole compared to XSS or SQL injection, but I'd rather not if I don't have to.",1521214111.0

The way we handle it is to leave the inactive environment in beanstalk running with zero instances. Fresh deployment is then the time it takes to spin and provision the new machine and do the deploy. No new load balancer, alarms, etc.

With packaging and deployment we average 9 min. From start of deploy to swapping the cname.

If we left a single machine running in the inactive instance we'd save another minute, maybe 90 seconds..

The easiest places to reduce time in the process is reducing package size and what gets put in the package. 

Beyond that... You're never going to get rid of the time it takes to provision new boxes, you can pre warm/boot the env while you're packaging and other things that will  help add some parallellism to a serial process.

dark-panda,"Rails apps and ruby in general are fairly leaky to begin with. You may want to start with tweaking the Apache config to reap your processes more often. You can have Apache for instance kill an instance and spawn a new one after performing X number of requests. See https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mpm_common.html#maxconnectionsperchild for instance. 10 hours is a long time for an Apache process to hang around, although that does depend on your load and app, but in general you want Apache reaping processes with some regularity. This will buy you time to either a) figure out where the memory leak is or b) tweak the Apache config until you’re okay with the performance and are reaping processes often enough but not so often it’s a drag on performance. 

To track down the memory leak, there’s all sorts of tools like looking at the ObjectSpace class and using the built in profiling tools and ruby-prof. I’ve written a gem that can make some of that easier, and can use it to profile actions or blocks and see where your memory is being consumed. It works with ruby-prof and GC statistics and such and can dump out a bunch of data per request into any format that ruby-prof supports. See https://github.com/dark-panda/active-profiling for details. You’ll want to look at the memory profiling options in ruby-prof specifically, configure active-profiling accordingly, then start narrowing down the places in code where you’re allocating stuff maybe inadvertently or doing something that you’re maybe not quite expecting.

brainbag,"1\. We do something like what you're asking about, using a serializer on a `jsonb` column.

    class UserOptionsSerializer
      def self.dump(user_options)
        user_options.to_json
      end
    
      def self.load(hash)
        return UserOptions.new if hash.blank?
        hash = JSON.parse(hash) if hash.is_a?(String)
        UserOptions.new(hash)
      end
    end

 This just turns the `user_options` column to and from a Ruby hash from JSON. There's some extra error handling in there that you'll need for that conversion.

We also have an object called UserOptions that handles some other logic, but if you don't care about that, you can just have it return the hash.

2\. Then make a [custom validator object](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#performing-custom-validations) using `ActiveModel::Validator` to validate each key of the JSON, adding errors to `record.errors`.

    class UserOptionsValidator < ActiveModel::Validator 
      def validate
        record.errors['some_json_key'] = ""TOTAL FAILURE""
      end
    end

3\. Finally, add this to your model:

    serialize :options, UserOptionsSerializer
    validates :options, user_options: true

tadrinth,"You're definitely going to want some kind of typing on these. Possibly by storing both the data and the type.

Look into Entity Attribute Value models. May not be quite what you need, but relevant.

How many of these are you storing and how big are they going to be? Because we started off serializing the attributes to a text column and then users started putting essays into them, and we didn't validate that the serialized data fit in the column. Then it truncates and you can't deserialize it and that suuuucks to clean up. Nowadays the nicer DBs directly support json columns which makes this all much easier.

What you may want to do is to make a custom attributes table. If these are totally custom per user, make them put in a field name and a type. Then have columns for user id, attrib id, field name, type, and the actual value stored. Then just join on that table when you load a user. Depending on your needs you might also have separate tables for data types that need different columns.",1520989737.0
brainbag,"You can't inject methods, lambdas, or procs as regular variables in a block **with the exact code you have**. There is a way to do it with `instance_exec` though.

There's no telling *why* you'd want to do this, without seeing the ReportThing code. 

Here are two ways of doing that that I can think of:

    class ReportThing
      def scope
        @scope = yield
      end
    
      def initialize(params, &block)
        instance_exec(&block)
      end
    end
    
    report = ReportThing.new({}) do # no |scope|
      scope { User.all }
    end

---

Slightly different requiring `call`:

    class ReportThing
      def scope
        @scope = yield
      end
    
      def initialize(params)
        # does something with params
        yield method(:scope)
      end
    end

    ReportThing.new({}) do |scope|
      scope.call { ""potato"" } # with ""call""
    end

You could do something easier with this (depending on the use case):

    class ReportThing
      def initialize(params)
        # does something with params
        @scope = yield if block_given?
      end
    end

    ReportThing.new({}) do 
      User.all
    end

I do a ton of metaprogramming in Ruby and this seems weird even to me.

If you're new to Ruby and generally curious about blocks, here's some extra info:

Blocks are commonly used for iteration (like `each`) but not always. You can think of a block as passing in a method that is defined in place. Some languages like JavaScript actually let you pass functions, Ruby lets you do blocks. Here's the same code in JavaScript:

    [1, 2, 3, 4].forEach(function(num) { console.log(num) })

A block really works for anything the method wants to `yield`. Here's a completely useless example to demonstrate:

    def num2x(x)
      result = x * 2
      yield result if block_given?
      result
    end

    num2x(15) { |x| puts x }",1520944193.0

ignurant,"The best thing you can do in these situations, is hop to the source for `ReportThing`. 

I'm not much of a rails person, but `scope` is a common class macro found on ActiveRecord models. I suspect that this class is a bit of meta programming to generate custom AR report classes. You will find something referencing `&block`, `block.call` or a `yield` statement in either the `#initialize` method, or an overwritten `self.new`.

You return a 400 and make your caller give it to you how you expect it.

Your API is a defined contract between you and the caller.  Accepting data that isn't formatted as expected isn't your API's job.

If you are saying the API contract you want to provide isn't a 1:1 match with the schema of how you want to store the data, then you need to provide a mapping layer between your api and your db, this would likely be done in the model.

This is the idea:

So **thing** would be Activity logged by user. **Thing type** would represent ActivityType (Playing Basketball, Reading, Daydreaming). ActivityType would could have many **characteristics** (duration, time units, calories, external_link, etc) specific to the particular ActivityType or even shared among other types (via habtm). Thus, some of your ActivityTypes could have duration field, while others won't.

Actual values (15 min, link URL, etc) associated with specific instances of **Activity** would be stored in **values** table.

The admins would be able to create new ActivityTypes and specify any characteristics these should have.

This might seem confusing and overly complicated, however, it's a pretty robust model to cover many use-cases where a **thing** could have different characteristics/properties depending on the **type of thing** that it is.

To make a case for Rails though, it works a little better out of the box, coming with ActiveRecord as an ORM and supports several SQL databases off the bat.  There's also a lot of great gems that have been produced by the community to help with various functions.
I'm not sure what your needs are exactly for a dynamic frontend, but embedded Ruby can be a powerful tool for making some dynamic content on your front end.  Additionally, the [Gon Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/gon/versions/6.2.0) allows you to access rails variables in frontend javascript code, which can be useful. 

If you're looking for a whole javascript framework for your frontend, [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com/) is cool.  Its conventions are pretty similar to Rails.  But if you already know Angular or React, feel free to use either of those.  Rails 5.1 brought support for Webpack and yarn, so javascript now plays better with Rails than it ever has.

To be fair to Node, it can also do all this but it does take more time to set up everything like connecting to a database, getting an ORM, etc.  Fortunately, there are a lot of guides out on the web to help with this if you do go that route.

What I do differently is I use figaro to populate `ENV` and then use that variable in `secrets.yml` which is later committed to git.

Something like this :-

    shared:
      mailgun_api_key: asljfna12
      mailgun_domain: domain.com
      slack_client_id: <%= ENV[""SLACK_CLIENT_ID""] %>
      slack_client_secret: <%= ENV[""SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET""] %>
      admin_username: <%= ENV[""ADMIN_USERNAME""] %>
      admin_password: <%= ENV[""ADMIN_PASSWORD""] %>

    development:
      secret_key_base: ad705030469137b4d4085a45b575519744bffbc5f61dc5c05c
      default_mail_from: <%= ENV[""DEFAULT_MAIL_FROM""] %>

    test:
      secret_key_base: 29bc8c0e71b6e19086a7b804a392fa9c4a39c8da10e9c058861d39abd30b7d6f5a0a9e576d9d
      default_mail_from: <%= ENV[""DEFAULT_MAIL_FROM""] %>

    production:
      secret_key_base: <%= ENV[""SECRET_KEY_BASE""] %>
      db_password: <%= ENV[""DATABASE_PASSWORD""] %>
      db_username: <%= ENV[""DATABASE_USERNAME""] %>
      db_name: <%= ENV[""DATABASE_NAME""] %>
      mailgun_api_key: <%= ENV[""MAILGUN_API_KEY""] %>
      mailgun_domain: <%= ENV[""MAILGUN_DOMAIN""] %>
      default_mail_from: <%= ENV[""DEFAULT_MAIL_FROM""] %>


In the `application.rb` file, I set `::Secrets = Rails.application.secrets` and then in the code, if I want to use, say, `mailgun_api_key`, I just do `Secrets.mailgun_api_key`.

This approach provides a lot more flexibility, like I can raise an error if certain var is missing, or convert them to int, boolean and use that converted values, in place of `if ENV[""BOOL""] == ""true""`",1520513986.0

ryanbigg,"Hi! My name is Ryan Bigg and you might remember me from [the books I’ve written about Ruby / Rails](https://ryanbigg.com/books) :) 

I've been developing Rails apps for 10 years now and have only recently begun to look at Hanami.

I’ve been toying around with Hanami for a few weeks now and imo it _feels_ better than Rails.  If you want to see some code rather than text, [here's my little example app I've been building with Hanami](http://github.com/radar/hanami-example).

Here are the top three things that I like about Hanami, in long form:

## Repository pattern instead of Active Record
Documentation link: [Hanami | Guides - Models Overview](http://hanamirb.org/guides/1.1/models/overview/)
 
The Active Record pattern encourages you to throw everything into the model. Think: callbacks, validations, persistence, database logic (queries) and business logic. 

In contrast, the repository pattern (through ROM) leads to a cleaner separation between your database and your application. I _especially_ like how validations are handled by `dry-validation`, a completely separate library to ROM. This _enforces_ a separation between your models, persistence and validation layers, allowing you to pick and choose which ones you wish to use.

My _favourite_ part about the repository pattern is that it's incredibly difficult to make database queries from a view. This helps prevent things like N+1 queries. 

Also: ROM has no such thing as callbacks, and that's a huge plus in my eyes too. Callbacks are _way_ too magical and -- using DHH's words -- too sharp a knife for developers to have. Explicitness in code leads to a much better understanding.

## Action classes

Documentation link: [Hanami | Guides - Actions Overview](http://hanamirb.org/guides/1.1/actions/overview/)

Rather than throwing all your actions into the same controller, they're separated out into their own classes.  This helps keep each action isolated from one another, leading to overall a cleaner application architecture. 

If you want to share things across actions, it's very easy to create a module for that functionality and to include it into those action classes. For instance, if you wanted a `find_post` method for `show`, `edit`, `update` and `destroy` actions, you can define this in a module and only include it in the actions you want. 

A Rails controller is typically made messier by the addition of ""helper"" methods like this. It's not uncommon to have Rails controllers of multiple hundreds of lines, due to the complexity of the actions and these helper methods. Separating out each action into its own class indeed makes them easier to work with. 

You're also able to test the action in complete isolation from the routing layer, as it is simply a class. I think this is what was attempted with Rails' controller specs... but those never really felt ""right"" to me and I typically go to Request Specs these days instead. Hanami brings me back to testing the actions easily. I like that.

### Params validation for actions

Documentation link: [Hanami | Guides - Action Parameters](http://hanamirb.org/guides/1.1/actions/parameters/)

Somewhat related to the previous point:

Actions in Hanami also use parameter validation (with the help of `dry-validation`, I think). This means that each action can uniquely validate the parameters. Rather than having `create_project_params` and `update_project_params` defined within a controller -- as you might do in Rails -- you can define what constitutes valid parameters right there in the action class. 

In my Hanami experiments, I've not found a use for this yet, but I can think of several places where I've needed this sort of thing in a Rails app.

## View classes
Documentation link: [Hanami | Guides - Views Overview](http://hanamirb.org/guides/1.1/views/overview/)

Similarly to Action classes, Hanami also has the concept of a view class.  I like these because they separate the logic of view ""helper"" methods and the templates very cleanly. 

In a Rails application, you define a helper in a module named after the controller. I never liked this approach for two main reasons: 1) normally I would only ever use the helper in _one_ particular view and 2) the helper is made _globally available_ across _all_ views in the application, which means I can't have a similarly named method in another helper module. A quite horrible design decision.

In Hanami, the view classes are a _great_ place to put these little helper methods _and_ because they're just small, isolated classes, you can test these without involving the router, controller or model.

## Conclusion

As I said at the beginning: Hanami _feels_ right. It's ""familiar"" enough -- still somewhat following the Model-View-Controller architecture that we know-and-love from Rails -- that it feels comfortable to use. There's a few places where your mind has to change into the ""Hanami Way"" (see above), but ultimately once your mind does that you'll realise that the Hanami way _is_ better.

Hanami has demonstrably learned the very hard lessons of big Rails application development and presents a robust, well-developed alternative web framework for Ruby.  

In fact, it is so robust and well-developed that if I was to develop a Ruby web application from scratch for production use, I would use Hanami over Rails -- despite my 10 years Rails experience.",1520379963.0

And I really can only recommend it. it got better with every major version. As soon as you get your head around it, you'll be able to combine a really powerful, magic and beautiful language (Ruby) with a state of the art web framework (RoR). I can really recommend 'the rails 5 way', from Fernandez.

it's not about the language you learn, it never is. it's the same with natural human languages like French or Russian. all the time you spend with trying to find the best language is kinda worthless. success will come from alone if you just speak it. so just learn Ruby and stick with it for a while. no matter what you learn afterwards, it will be easier, because you already speak one programming language. the more you speak, the easier new ones will be.

monorkin,"**I'd say yes.** Rails has become the defacto standard when it comes to MVC frameworks. Even if you end up not liking it and moving to another framework/language the base concepts are still the same as in Rails.

**Learning Rails has helped me do projects in Java, Elixir and Python without having to go through a major learning curve.**

I have to point out here that **my opinion is biased**. I've been working profesionally with Ruby and Rails for the last 5 years.

If your question is more focused on job security I can just state from experience that it's harder (or at least it was) to get a starting position with Ruby than with say Python, Java or Swift, but it's not as hard as with Elixir or Erlang. Though after a year or two of experiance the job market opens up significantly. There still is a demand for Ruby developers, as other comments stated there are a lot of legacy projects and there are new projects being started all the time. Recently DigitalOcean and Netflix have been hiring Ruby developers for new projects.

**Ruby isn't the hot new thing anymore, but in my opinion, it's here to stay.** That's just the normal cycle of the industry. Look at PHP, I thought it was dead back in 2011 yet here it is, stronger than ever.

Serializedrequests,"**Edit:** This ramble got upvoted a lot, so I really want to clarify that, in my opinion, Rails has gone down a weird direction compared to the rest of the internet with Turbolinks. But, that weird direction does allow rapid prototyping and good performance, so it makes sense for some projects. **I would not recommend that a new developer start with Turbolinks, but instead use Rails as an API and learn a JS framework.** ActionView and Turbolinks really shines if part of your app is very static and simple form driven (say, the customer facing portion). You can still make the admin a SPA.

-----------------------

I have a number of monolithic enterprise applications doing things the old way. I don't see why it would particularly be worth spending hundreds of hours migrating them to a SPA framework.

The Rails guide way is great for rapid prototyping and graceful degradation, and apparently making Basecamp. Once you go API+SPA you lose all these shortcuts that make things quick as you are effectively building 2 apps, but you can definitely do that in Rails using any toolchain you want. You can really go a long way with Turbolinks and UJS, just check out Basecamp.

Personally, I build SPA portions of my apps in **Elm** because I love the language, and because I don't have time for a new JS framework every week. I have elm-make emit a .js file to include in the asset pipeline and call it good. The only other non-standard view components I use are Slim or Haml. I am trying out Trailblazer Cells, but I just don't have the kind of complexity in my view layer that demands being so explicit about my view objects and learning a whole new API with its associated pitfalls. ActionView is fast and easy. (I really like Trailblazer concepts and operations though.)

The problems that you can run into with the Rails conventions are numerous, and detailed in many articles. I've seen every kind of setup and alternative component used in a Rails project (and used many of them myself) and I can tell you that everyone's silver bullet is making some kind of tradeoff, and ActionView + the asset pipeline (as antiquated as it is) can still get you a long way.

**tl;dr** Yes I do use the Rails defaults on greenfield projects, because it is extremely quick to get up and running and still has decent results. However, for a new developer I would definitely suggest using Rails as an API only, and learning a SPA framework like React + Redux, Vue, etc. (Or my favorite language, Elm!)",1520032588.0

DHH leaned towards coffeescript for quite some time (still does?), which I personally find to be horrible. I find it uncommon to encounter a rails developer that doesn't rip out coffeescript (and turbolinks along with other things) as soon as they start a new app. 

For the most part, javascript has a tendency to evolve so fast that its really difficult to follow the standard ""convention over configuration"" as there is no real convention in the javascript land.

These old fashioned terminal programs only send the screen diffs, but you program them as if you're writing the whole screen on each action.

7. Frankly I'd just be happy to have somebody look at it. I hit a wall tonight when I broke my ability to commit new records to the Review table. I know my associations are the problem but :has_many and :belongs_to *should* work. I've tried many more complicated versions of that but no dice. I'm also having issues updating the Balance field in my Accounts table but that functionality is probably a pipe dream.

Anyway, it's all due Thursday (3/15/18) night. I've aced every assignment so far, just adding specific things like log-in or a shopping cart, but taken as a whole the website kind of sucks.

The Reviews stuff all broke down after I added associations. The reviews I hard coded in via seed are still in there but on update ruby notices they're breaking the rules. From shell when I try to commit a new review:
`""review""=>{""customer_id""=>""3"", ""tutor_id""=>""1"", ""reviewdate(1i)""=>""2018"", ""reviewdate(2i)""=>""3"", ""reviewdate(3i)""=>""14"", ""reviewstars""=>""5"", ""reviewtext""=>""""}, ""commit""=>""Create Review""}`

Which is exactly what I intend. But then!
`Person Load (0.5ms)  SELECT  ""people"".* FROM ""people"" WHERE ""people"".""id"" = ? LIMIT ?  [[""id"", 1], [""LIMIT"", 1]]`
`Unpermitted parameter: :customer_id`
`   (0.0ms)  begin transaction`
`  Tutor Load (0.5ms)  SELECT  ""tutors"".* FROM ""tutors"" WHERE ""tutors"".""id"" = ? LIMIT ?  [[""id"", 1], [""LIMIT"", 1]]`
`   (0.0ms)  rollback transaction`
No idea man.

As for accounts, I added an empty ""cart_price"" array to my sessions controller and update it from within the cart view to match totprice. Then in the home controller, where lot's of functionality lives, I have this. It interacts with the Accounts model, but currently it just passes nil.

capn_sanjuro,"Well, from the lack of comments it looks like you are about to be one of Reddit's foremost experts on Devise, payments processing and GDPR.

Keep us posted on what you learn?",1519876406.0
ziptofaf,"Place I work at is  implementing GDPR policies and well, they are quite nightmare to deal with but here are some pointers:

* Firstly, it's not Rails only problem. Proper solutions will require attention from sysadmins and lawyers as well. Keep in mind that depending on a scale of a project extent of what you need to do changes as well. Small company does not have to hold to the same policies as a huge enterprise (but how much is good enough is something you need lawyer to chime in to make sure of)
* Secondly, from technical perspective there are these challenges that need to be tackled:
 * Data leaks and logging. Gems like audited are a place to start with but you might de facto need a short-term log on who accessed which record. So it's at least possible to prove on paper that you can show a leak has occured and employee without sufficient access saw information they should not have access to. 
 * Right to be forgotten - this is probably the hardest part to tackle. As it does not only mean to delete information about a user (save for one you need stored by law) from your live database but also from your BACKUPS. I have seen two solutions. One is to store IDs of users that wished to be deleted and upon recovery you parse this list and remove all records from live database (well, technically speaking it's not ""remove"", it's just ""ensure it no longer identifies them""). This means you kinda keep them but they are not in your application. This will probably fly in a smaller organization. Solution #2 is to have a unique encryption key for each user and their data. If they want to be forgotten then you just delete that key and you are done - data might be physically there but it cannot be accessed by anyone, including you. These are the two most sane ways of doing it, I would not recommend recursively prunning your backups at the very least. 
 * User can ask for all data you have on them. This also means your log files. In a case of a web shop you will likely need to go through their saved baskets, orders they have made, account information, any profiling and export that. This pretty much has to be done on per-model basis, with some kind of .to_text method (so it looks readable), you will need a general function that exports all that for a given user_id as well. 
 * [Nightmare email](https://constantk.wordpress.com/2017/06/30/the-nightmare-letter-a-subject-access-request-under-gdpr/). Any application wanting to be compliant with GDPR should have answers to questions in this example. And they better be readily available. 
 * Check where you are storing your data and if that place IS compliant with GDPR. Storing Europeans data inside US is generally a no-go. 

> Devise compliance with GDPR - how to implement it

This one is actually simple and requires very little changes. You just need additional fields like ""agreed_to_x_at"" as you can have one checkbox per type of data you will get from users and their explicit permission. So just registered_at is insufficient. But save for that you are good to go. 

> How to use Postgres in Rails and be GDPR compliant

Nothing changes on the Postgres side directly. Encrypt your backups, possibly encrypt user information too with unique keys. 

Save for that you need your data retention policy and documentation (you define your goals yourself, just need to explain why). Eg. how long are you planning to store specific type of data and why that long, what measures to protect it you have, who has access to it etc. 

GDPR can become a nightmare on sites like Reddit but it doesn't affect typical applications like web stores THAT much. The reason it's a nightmare for discussion boards is that you will likely encounter ""critical classified data"" like people talking about their health, sex orientantion etc. This means you must have an inspector at your company and you cannot rely on implicit agreement (eg. you don't need to ask a user if it's fine to use their address if you are a shop and they bought something). This is actually a really painful thing for small local discussion forums (I have talked to a lawyer, even non-commercial forum falls under GDPR in my country) but it's not too bad for businesses.",1519894676.0

gelfin,"You’ve got a pretty good starting point there in the things  he’s been asked that have tripped him up.  Your buddy has most certainly used ActiveSupport.  It’s all over Rails by default.  The thing that gets him is he doesn’t *know* he’s using it, or what it gives him he isn’t getting from vanilla Ruby.

Ever noticed how, in a Rails controller, you can refer to URL params with either a symbol (params[:sessionId]) or a string (params[‘sessionId’])?  Ruby Hashes can’t do that.  Why do you think you can in Rails projects?  Maybe step through that code in a debugger (which a mid/senior Rails developer should definitely know how to use — check out “pry-byebug” for a free command-line debugger, or RubyMine has an excellent visual debugger) and see why it works.

ActiveSupport is a collection of utilities so helpful it’s often hard to avoid pulling it into even many non-Rails Ruby projects, and a good Ruby developer should know roughly what’s there so he doesn’t reinvent the wheels it provides.

Gems in Ruby are brutally simple to write.  He should look up a tutorial and write a toy one just to see how the magic works.  Then do “gem environment” at the command line.  Among the lines it spits out is the location of your locally installed gems.  You can dig into any one of those and, once you know how gems are structured, can start to see how they work.  Many of them are far more simple than you might guess.  Just because it’s a published gem doesn’t mean it was written by some super-genius sitting alone on a mountaintop subsisting entirely on Ruby.  One of the great things about open source and the proliferation of modular, interpreted languages is that there is no “secret sauce”. The guts of everything you use is right there for you.  One of the signature skills distinguishing a more senior level of ability is having realized and taken advantage of this.  Don’t be afraid to chase behavior outside the boundaries of your own code to understand why something is happening.  You’ll learn a lot in the process, both about why things happen and how more advanced professionals in the field write code.

In that vein, we don’t just curl up by a fire with the Rails source for fun.  That can’t be a checkbox item, “yup, I looked at it.”  Generally we’ve done it because we hit a weird problem where, say, ActiveRecord wasn’t behaving like we thought it would in a particular case and we needed to figure out how to make it behave.  As an interviewer, I’d follow up “I haven’t had a chance” with, “what in your estimation would ‘a chance’ look like?  Under what circumstances would you take a look?”

In fact, putting on my interviewer hat for a moment, and just given what you’ve said here, here’s what I’m thinking when I look at your buddy’s resume:  His one Rails job has been as the sole developer on a basic website.  He probably hasn’t pushed the limits of Rails in any way because of the nature of the project, and because he’s working alone I’d expect to see code that doesn’t quite conform to the norms of Rails development.  I’d lead with questions intended to confirm or refute that suspicion, as your friend’s interviewers are, and his answers would tend more to confirm the suspicion.  He is presenting as more of a junior developer, who will need a lot of mentoring just to get up to the level of the team.  His experience says more “website developer who happens to use Rails” than “experienced Rails application engineer.”  I’m sorry if that sounds harsh put like that, but that’s exactly the wall he’s running into in his interviews.

And just as a word-choice thing, do *not* say “I haven’t had a chance to.”  That comes across in a subtly bad way.  Your interviewer will hear, “I’ve had neither the need nor the curiosity, but it’s not my fault.”  Come up with a better way to answer things that are eliciting that response.  Even just “no, I haven’t” is a better response for the lack of that little whiff of excuse-making.  Better if he can honestly answer “yes” to some of them, with examples.

From what you’ve said, if I can name one thing that’s going to boost your buddy’s chances, it’s curiosity.  To get out of where he is, he needs to develop and exercise it, and to get to that next rung he needs to prepare answers for interviewers that exhibit it.  That’s often the make-or-break trait for all levels of software development.  You can lack particular skills or knowledge, but being thoughtful, creative and curious, and being able to detail how you’d go about finding out the answer can be as good or better than just knowing it.",1519832439.0

Contracting has its drawbacks and he probably shouldn't do it for too long, but it'd show that he's willing to dive in without much hand-holding.

Option 3 is best as it essentially isolate backend and front end.  You can have them on completely different servers and so forth.

Once you get into a lot of front end JS framework,  SPA becomes very attractive from a coding architecture standpoint.   There is a neatness to concern isolation between business versus user interface.

Option 2 is good if you don't need huge amount of scale isolation and starting out.  I use method 2 to convert large old applications toward a fully SPA state.  Sometimes you have to go in steps and it's possible to convert single feature or small part of your application this way if it is an old and large app.   But this mixes front/back stuff, and I tend to think can create the potential for a greater amount of errors along the way.

Option 2 with Rails 5.1 and up is really simple to use to extend existing applications. You can pretty much send any data you need from your back-end to react straight via a `react_component` helper, it also integrates well with capistrano and rest of your Rails environment. We are currently deploying this approach in an originally mostly back-end heavy application that used basic JS (via remote: true) and some bootstrap for CSS. It makes absolutely no financial sense to rebuild it using API mode and this solution is a good way around it. 

If you are building a new application from the scratch then I would opt for 3rd option. Rails has a good API mode, you can find gems to handle CORS and JWT easily as well.

1) Move note creation to a `notes#new` view.

The backend uploader doesn't matter much as it can be any of the ones you mentioned or with ActiveStorage. When the event is triggered, the browser will make an AJAX post to the application which uploads the file and sends a JSON response. The editor will then insert the URL from the JSON response as a link to the image. ",1519735934.0

pm_me_ur__labia,"Unrelated, but your code is a little confusing to me. I'm going to explain the choices I don't understand, but it could be my own inexperience, and if I'm wrong, I'd be happy to hear it.

First, you're declaring this ""books"" variable in your ERB, but you should probably declare it as a global @books variable in your controller.

Second, your first for loop sets the class as ""klass"" which in this case is a ruby object. I'm pretty sure when you look at the generated source code you're going to see something like:

    <div class=""Object object"">

which isn't useful, and it's also not really a good use of classes. You probably want something more like

    <% [:booklist, :booklist_copy].each do |book| %>
        <div id=""<%='book_' + book.id%> class=""book"">
    <% end %>

which would give you something like 

    <div id=""book_12"" class=""book"">

Lastly, you're running a for loop inside your for loop, which means your'e going to get a list of 5 the same five books inside each iteration of the list.

Now for your actual question. You want the links to be numbered, right? Like ""1. The Taming of the Shrew, 2. Ulysses"". You're in luck because HTML actually provides this feature out of the box. If you use your for loop to generate an Ordered List, you'll get the results you want.

So in your controller, you'll declare your @books instance variable to give you your 5 books in the view. Then in the view you could do something like this:

    <ol>
        <% @books.each do |book| %>
            <li><%= link_to book.title, book, class: ""book"", id: ""book_"" + book.id</li>

Otherwise, you'd need to go through stepwise comparisons; I doubt you're going to find a lot of comparison tutorials that happen to use exactly the start & end points that match your situation.

freakyDaz,"Depends on the app but for most you want to check the database. All queries should be using indexes, and you shouldn't need eager loading. The key is to minimize both the calls to the database and the length of time in the database.

If you get that going well l, then you have a choice. Do you want to benchmark parts of your code, rewrite and shave off milliseconds or do you want to work out the best place to cache. Rails makes it easy to cache both view fragments and data. Locate areas that are most frequently accessed but rarely change and begin caching them making sure you have a strong plan on how to expire and flush the cache correctly. From a macro level you can cache from nginx or whatever proxy you site behind.

So we end up at optimising code for micro improvements. Reducing iterations, allocations and potentially offloading work to threads or background workers. There is no easy answer for this. Every single optimization will be unique to the app and it's requirements.

Last but not least is perceived speed by reducing the time it takes for the end user to interact with your app. So that means try to do the bare minimum to render the page and start loading the rest whilst the user navigates. If it's an API then this of course doesn't apply. Other front end improvements can be found in reducing reflows to speed up CSS rendering and of course compressing and caching static assets.",1519242166.0

I've used all sorts of tools, but most recently my general strategy is to take a look at Newrelic (or some equivalent), and prioritize based on both how frequently endpoints are getting hit, and what the average request times are. Best case scenario, we would refactor slow code. Tied for worst case scenario, we would either offload expensive operations onto asynchronous workers, cache, or look for alternate implementations (e.g. using Elasticsearch for complex data aggregation instead of plain DB queries).

Building from Alpine will save you a couple hundred MB at least. Ubuntu is a great base image for experimenting and figuring out how to run things in a container, but Alpine is the distro you want to base your production images on.

My projects now have a `bin/setup` file that installs specific versions of all Gems named in my `Gemfile` and then runs `bundle install --binstubs --local`. Aside from forcing me to know in detail exactly what I'm building, this has the benefit of future compatibility; I can recreate a build exactly as it was six months ago because I'm installing the same versions of the Gems that I used then (into a Gemset when using `rbenv` or `rvm`). I got burned a few months ago by not being able to rebuild a two-year-old app because the Gem versions had not been properly locked down. Never again. Extra points for having local copies of those historical Gemsets (not necessarily in the same repo as the app itself) so that, even if a Gem is yanked, you'll still be able to get back to Kansas.

brainbag,"I know it can be frustrating to ask the Internet for help with this like this, so I'll do my best to to answer. What you've written out sounds to me like one of those fun data mapping complexity challenges you get in any domain model.

I strongly discourage delegating to associations in models. It makes the code a bit more simple, but at the cost of hidden SQL queries if your records aren't already preloaded elsewhere, which *will* bite you when you inevitably need to reduce your query load. I strongly *encourage* your models to be as dumb as possible with just associations and validations, and use other objects for mapping data access. (""skinny controllers, skinny models"")

Law of Demeter is great when you're designing your own interfaces, but trying to strictly adhere to it with ActiveRecord's bloated responsibilities almost always causes more harm than good. It's much better practice to simply wrap up the complex queries and hide them from the rest of the app than it is to make your models more complex for the sake of less dots.

Here's some ideas on how to do that, I hope they help:

1\. You can compound `has_many :through` if you need to have deep relationships. For example:

    class Driver 
      has_many :routes
      has_many :rides, through: :routes
      has_many :transactions, through: :rides
    end

    > driver.transactions
    => [#<Transaction:...>, #<Transaction:...>]

2\. You can also define methods directly on associations:

    class Driver
      has_many :routes do 
        def closed
          where(status: :closed) # all routes with closed status
        end
      end

      # or via a module
      has_many :routes, extend: DriverRoutesQueries
    end

    > driver.routes.closed
    => [#<Route:... status: :closed>, #<Route:... status: :closed>]
   
3\. You can use a Query object pattern to extend your existing objects so all of your complex queries are in one place instead of in controllers:

    class TransactionQuery
      def initialize(transaction)
        @transaction = transaction
      end 

      def some_complex_query
        @transaction.riders.includes(:billing, :profile, routes: [:driver]).where(driver: some_person).distinct
      end
    end

    # controller
    def index
      @riders = TransactionQuery.new(transaction).some_complex_query
    end

- jwt is a new fancy way to form tokens. It may be used to store arbitrary amount of information like your id, name, age, etc. in a single ""word"", you may think of it like as a serialized json. It may be passed by cookies, as a request param or any other way any id/token may be passed. 
- basic auth is a bit different creature. With basic auth browser will ask your login-passwd in modal, no input form needed. Upon entering it would calculate hash and attach it as an HTTP header. You don't need to create sign in forms by the price of very little control over  incorrect input handling. Normally you would see this on prototypes or intetnal tools only. And again technically it is a mere HTTP header, just like cookies, you can provision it with a custom token and handle differently.

ziptofaf,"> I've heard of JWT and have read a bit about it, but im not sure how I would send the token on the raspberry pi end? Is this even something that's possible?

Why wouldn't it? JWT token is just an additional Header you have to include in your request. Such as ""Authorization: JWT <insert_token_number>. Raspberry Pi is a full fledged device, I see no reasons why it would be a problem, it's not a chip with no internal memory to store it.

This pretty much goes as follows:

- you send your credentials to the server
- server checks their correctness. If this sounds right it sends a token to you. Token not even being necessarily encrypted (and often literally read as ""user_id: <number>""), just digitally signed (meaning you can read it from the client but not alter it).
- save that token somewhere on your client 
- and send it as an additional HTTP header with each request.

It's pretty much as simple as:

`curl --request POST --url https://example.com/log/ --header 'authorization: JWT token_number' --data '{""temperature: 20C""}'`",1518762821.0
in0pinatus,"I'm really enjoying this series. He's illustrating specific ideas using the Basecamp 3 source code, and I'm picking up as much from that, just in passing, as I am from the points being made.

My notes on DHH's style:

* Routinely extracts responsibilities with attributes into has_one associated models
* Very aggressively extracts behaviours into Concerns
* Comfortable including many modules; that `ApplicationController` is remarkable, so's [this](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/964244090224128001)
* Comfortable using what he calls ""globals"" (which are actually thread-locals)
* Routinely uses callbacks for side-effects
* Moves side-effect work into background jobs
* Calls `create!` inside models (presumably also unafraid to update/save)
* Disdainful of service objects / transaction-script classes

Some of this is simply good OO Ruby, such as extracting responsibilities and behaviours; that's not always evident enough in Rails applications. And some of this directly contradicts advice that you'll read elsewhere.

Never_Again_2017,"Rails has been my main framework for 9 years but I'm skeptical of DHH's style here. I'm wondering if this kind of coding — globals, many includes, many implicit side effects — are only practical in DHH's situation:

* He's been only working on project for 10+ years. He doesn't need ""navigational signposts"" in his code because he wrote / managed it. He can know what every single thing does.
* He can choose developers who code in exactly the style he requests.

But for me, this kind of programming is a nightmare:

* As a consultant, I've worked on dozens of Rails apps. I _need_ ways to understand what code is doing, but this coding style offers no help.
* I don't have control over who is developing the apps I work on.

To me, this is the _real_ real world, and pretty much every Rails project I've ever had to jump into (I.e., I didn't start myself) has been awful.

EDIT: I see other coding problems in his videos, which have a real 'cowboy coding' feel. For example, poorly named classes and methods. He talks about it a lot — he seems a little defensive, and spend time describing how fun it is to invent new ""delicious"" words for things. But in my real world, when I (frequently) see mis-named or cutesy-named items, it's very frustrating. They take what should have been a smooth experience of reading code, and introduced roadblocks and ego.

A couple examples from his videos:

* `Access`. It's a join between a user and a bucket, I believe. But it does not represent ""an access"", i.e., an access event. Instead, calling it `AccessRights` would be right on the nose, and eliminate guessing. This is a fine point here, I realize. But language is important, and if we can be clearer, then let's do it!
*  `after_save :remember_to_eavesdrop`. He's showing that in video 2. He's proud of this naming. (Or, on the defensive about it?) But to me, this is very obfuscated. The name only gives semi-clues about what it does. Understanding this code requires a break in flow to go and read more (potentially obfuscated code) to understand it.

- Docker to build and test the image. I use the [Phusion Passenger container](https://github.com/phusion/passenger-docker). On success, build and execute on my staging/main server. I usually use the `script` executor and leverage docker from the shell. I haven't had as good luck using the `docker` executor directly.
- [This amazing nginx reverse proxy container](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) allows me to stand up any sort of container, and quickly get full port/domain resolution off the ground by simply passing in an `-e VIRTUAL_HOST` flag when I start a container. It's YUUUGGE. I have my internal DNS pointed with a wildcard to my CI host, and this guy sorts out the rest.
- When my new container is started, the jwilder/nginx-proxy container sorts outwhat domains map to which application, and all my internal web apps (old and new) just kind of make themselves work with very little configuration.

You want to expand the image after click. To begin, you haven't really explained enough to help you fix it. 

Is the image inside of a container? Do you want the image to expand and push surrounding containers? 

One simple solution is to render the image onto a popup modal after click. For this check bootstrap docs.

Factories are more flexible, because with them you can generate test records dynamically, *and* they can also play the role of fixtures (i.e. created at the beginning beginning of the test suite).

From the user perspective they’d see:

1.	Empty form they fill out and submit. 
2.	model would not be saved, but they’d see validation messages and a “continue anyway” button. 
3.	they click the button and it saves


Another idea is that you could make a Ruby object that includes ActiveModel validations and delegates methods to your model. Then build your view so that it shows “errors” from the Ruby object, but your controller only checks the model itself for validation errors. ",1518386018.0

real_fanpuns,"I wouldn't use your feelings as a form of validation as to whether you ""are there yet."" I would start applying for jobs right away, if that's the direction you want to go. Go on a few interviews and I think you'll get much more objective feedback of whether you are there (you may also get a job). Use that feedback to determine the course for future (personal) development.

If you are looking to take the professional path freelancing then I would say start with something small, but that pays you real money. I remember the first paid project I ever got. At one point, I couldn't believe that someone was paying me money to do this thing that I wanted to do. I built them a rocket ship when all they really needed were some basic pages and automatic mailers, but the experience was worthwhile for two reasons: (1) it made me feel like a professional, I was getting paid to do something and (2) I learned the very important skill of managing a project with non-technical people, which no matter if you end up at a company or working for yourself, you will need to learn to do. Also, this stuff snowballed for me. Do a good job and people will tell their friends and colleagues.

If you have designs on a starting something, I think this a bit of a different ball of wax. All teams require a ""technical person"" who will likely do all the coding and it can be daunting even after the first meeting when everyone is talking about awesome features and all you are hearing is the laundry list of tech that you will have to learn to make it happen. If you find that feeling more scary than exciting, maybe you want to get some more experience in other areas before diving into a startup.

kobaltzz,"If your application grows and you need to start to horizontally scale (Load Balancer + Multiple App Servers), you will then have to plan to migrate the data off into a cloud storage.

You're creating a commitment to a server. Servers are best treated as something noncommittal. This will allow for new ""identical"" environments to be spun up easily and has a number of other benefits. For example, AWS Beanstalk has autoscaling which is really handy for minimizing costs when the environment isn't under load. Also, you can tell Beanstalk to rebuilt a server and it will load a new AMI and run through the continuous deployment tasks.

If it is a small hobby project, then keep it on local. If it is something that will be generating traffic, you may want to move the storage data over to the cloud. If it is something that people are compensating you for, move it to the cloud. Or, if it is important data to you then maybe move it to the cloud.

You can also checkout Minio.io which mimics the AWS S3 API and allows you to connect ActiveStorage to a cloud file service.",1518225424.0

SkulloWorld,"There's a few pieces to this that you need to do together to make this work nicely.

Per /u/midasgoldentouch you can use @client.appliances.build in your appliances_controller, but for that to be possible the following needs to be done:

* Your Client model should have `has_many :appliances`
* Your Appliance model should have `belongs_to :client` - This will also require you to have a migration for your appliances model where it adds the column `client_id` as an `integer` column.
* You should use nested routes similar to:

-
    resources :clients do # maybe use `shallow: true` here as well, left as an exercise for the reader to investigate this
      resources :appliances
    end
 
 * That will then mean in your Client view, you can create a link to your appliances form using `link_to 'Add Appliance', new_appliance_client_path(@client)`
 * In your Appliances controller `new` action, use something like the following:

-
    @client = Client.find(params[:client_id])
    @appliance = @client.appliances.build

 * In your Appliances controller `create` action use something like:

-
    @client = Client.find(params[:client_id])
    @appliance = @client.appliances.build(appliance_params)
    if @appliance.save
      # Flash message and redirection logic

You definitely need to sell him on dropping Flash, for all the reasons listed, and which you already know.  Unless he’s intent on hiring animators to make cartoons from 2002, and willing to accept that half or more of his potential audience won’t be able to watch them, there’s no more excuse for it.  But you’ll need to understand the things he expects to get out of Flash and educate him on the HTML5 way of accomplishing the same things without buying expensive seats of Flash.

The rest of the choices might be okay.  If a themed, off-the-shelf package like Moodle meets his business needs, and there isn’t an alternative in your preferred language, then you will be wasting mountains of time reinventing something you could just install.  And that could require PHP.  It might be less exciting, but it’s the right business choice.

You also need to consider the job market in your area.  If there are basically no Rails or React jobs or developers to be found, apart from you, then your CTO won’t be able to staff up the team, and he will be completely screwed if you get hit by a bus one day.

Git is a better choice, but the really important thing is to make sure he’s using *any* sort of source control.  Git can be a steep learning curve, particularly for people versed in other VCS, because they have a lot of idioms to unlearn.

The great thing about React is you can use it piecemeal.  Use the stock site, but then any custom components you need, you can write in React, and demonstrate how they’re fast, maintainable, well-tested and mount right up in the existing page.  As the business (hopefully) grows, more customizations will make it make sense for larger and larger portions of the app to be in React, so long as the initial efforts are successful.

ryanlue,"### Answering the Question

**tl;dr** You can't pass data structures around between Ruby and JavaScript like that.

    <tr id=""payslips"" data-selected=""<%= @selected %>"" onclick=""test2(this);"">

This line doesn't actually put the array into the `data-selected` attribute — HTML is just plain text. You can confirm this yourself by inspecting the source code of the rendered page in your browser. In order for JavaScript to retrieve an array from plain text, you have to use Ruby to [serialize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) it (_e.g.,_ into JSON), place the resulting plain text into HTML, and then de-serialize it back into the original data structure in JavaScript.

You might want to try the [gon](https://github.com/gazay/gon) gem for that purpose, or check out [this RailsCast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/324-passing-data-to-javascript), which covers the serialization process.

### Fixing your problems

But that's actually not going to fix anything. You're trying to manipulate a Ruby variable (backend) through user interaction on the frontend, which simply doesn't work because HTTP is a **stateless protocol** (_i.e.,_ the value of your Ruby variables gets wiped at the end of every request/response cycle). You're setting `@selected = []` in `#index`, but by the time you `$.get('/payslips/add_to_selected')`, a new request has started, and the old `@selected` is gone. That's why you're getting

    NoMethodError (undefined method `<<' for nil:NilClass): app/controllers/payslips_controller.rb:98:in `add_to_selected'

I can't tell what you're trying to do with `@selected` once it's done (I imagine you'd use it to update some database records?), but your options are either to manage the state about multiple entities entirely in JS and then pass that data to an `#update` controller action as request parameters, or perform the data operations one at a time with separate AJAX calls (again, probably to `#update`) for each one.

The simplest way would be to have a bookings table that has (property_id, date, customer_id) - with a unique index on [property_id, date]. Then you create one row per day of the booking.

Sharps_xp,"You can create a Bookings Table {user_id, start_date, end_date, property_id}. If User A books property A, then a record will exist in the Bookings table. If User B happened to be looking at the same property A, and attempts to book it, then a simple lookup can ensure that there are no double bookings. Like in another comment mentions, you should do this in a transaction. everything is honky dory or bail the whole thing.

On the user experience side of the equation, you can use something like ActionCable to broadcast to anyone looking at property A whether or not it has been bookings for certain dates, along with a list of alternative bookable properties.

So in terms of performance and scalability, you're going to run into issues fast if you have a high traffic site, those DB writes to the bookings table may start to hurt you once multiple users start asking for property A alongside subsequent reads on that table for the same property, 1 person is going to get lucky and the other users are going to be waiting SECONDS on their mobile devices only to find out they didn't get it as well as other similar properties in the seconds they were waiting. One approach you can take is once a user shows intent to book, you can lock that property so that other users don't try to even look at the property, and you can carefully do this in an in-memory DB like redis, with perhaps a 6 minute expiration with a complimenting UI to indicate the short time window to book. If by chance multiple users show their intent to book property A, one of them will get lucky and get the chance to book, while the other simply moves onto the next one, but you won't get angry users thinking they had a fair opportunity and being disappointed when they decide to book. you have to be very careful with this cache b/c if you don't, you might tell people something is about to be booked when there isn't and you'll end up with no bookings at all.",1517990079.0

Heroku get your apps up, it isn't really a superb stack for anything at scale requiring real infrastructure and network security.

Assuming the data center and network availability to your servers can handle it for a smaller attack.  Good network firewall to try and block suspicious connections.  Then the request hit a Web Application Firewall that again checks a lot of the authenticity and wholesomeness of the request with even more HTTP level filters on number of requests, what they are requesting, etc...  Once it's past those filters, then and only then does a request start hitting your application servers.  Which should be able to be served from multiple web servers allowing you to scale up at bit.

At the application layer,  try sending off things like assets to CDN.  Reduce running requirements to as little disk access as possible so you can utilize something like Redis or Memcached.  A lot of application stuff is basically just a lot of optimization to increase your ability to scale up.

    def destroy
      current_user.comments.find(params[id]).destroy

tumes,"On the most superficial level, the one bit of advice I would give is to flip the conditional to be the affirmative case (i.e. that a user may only delete a comment if they own it, then do the error handling in an else statement) or maybe throw it in a `before_action`, but that's not an especially exciting piece of a advice.

I think the real answer you may be looking for, since your hunch is that this feels wrong, is to look at some authorization libraries. There are several options (perhaps most notably Ryan Bates' Cancan), but the one I will recommend is [pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit) since it's relatively well maintained and it's the last one I used. Feel free to look up alternatives, but I think this is roughly what you're looking for.

By way of short explanation, pundit allows you to define policies which can accept a context (in this case, who the current user is) and determine if they may or may not operate on a class (usually a Rails model). In your case, you might write a `CommentPolicy` which includes the method `destroy?` which ensures that a given instance of a comment is owned by the current user. Then in your controller you can call `authorize @comment` before any of the rest of the action runs, and pundit will throw an authorization exception if the current user is trying to delete someone else's comment, which you can handle as you please.

A nice additional feature of pundit is that you can also define scopes in your policies, which could easily replace some code you may have written on, say, a comment index for a given user that only lists their comments. Functionally, it will likely be a matter of copying and pasting what you've already written into a policy, but it terms of code organization, it means that you know that you can just look in your policies folder to figure out where in your code authorization rules are stored.

Edit: To be clear, this may feel wrong, but if you have a simple app, there's nothing wrong with your approach. That being said, there's no harm in familiarizing yourself with an authorization library, since it's a pretty common tool in production apps.",1517903512.0

If the intention is to ensure that a Book model always has an author attribute, this is the wrong place to achieve it. The idiomatic Rails approach is to [validate attribute presence in the model](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#presence).

Nonetheless the following pattern does what you're asking and is documented at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html#method-i-require:

If you really need pre-upload validation, you're probably going to need some sort of validation process. This can be done in JS by hooking into the `direct-uploads` events.

Alternatively, you could send the meta data to the server prior to upload for backend validation of some sort prior to the actual upload. I [wrote an article](https://medium.com/@dwestendorf/roll-your-own-s3-client-side-file-uploads-59f32cf25b69) on this which would allow you to validate mime-type, filesize, per-user upload quotas, etc.

* It reveals implementation details about your application (i.e. class names, model names and table names by extension)

in0pinatus,"You're not an idiot for thinking of it! - but this is not the proper use of SGIDs, which are for cross-system entity references* not authorisation. They are not suitable for authorisation because they cannot be revoked (although they can self-expire). Note that JWTs also have serious revocation issues due to their 'self-describing' nature. Rails's session cookie store has a similar problem.

SGID signatures use strong encryption and you'd be wasting your time with a ""second pass"". As long as your secret_key_base is safe they cannot be spoofed, except possibly by a determined attacker with nation-level resources and knowledge of unrevealed weaknesses in SHA256. However, like any credential, they can be stolen, which necessitates a revocation mechanism.

It is pointless to store SGIDs in a table against a particular entity, because used correctly they are simply a signed reference to that entity anyway. You may as well fall back to issuing random base36 strings as API keys and maintaining a separate table of keys that have been issued, along with their grants and metadata.

The iframes reload each time, but it is no slower than the legacy system.  We will then just migrate one page at a time as we touch them.

2) Start with the stripped down API-only version of ruby on rails. This'll help you with the MVC stuff. You can do a single page application in PHP/Javascript and pull data in from RoR.

3) Docker does not play nice with RoR. The reason for this is that ruby/RoR has its own workflow with regards to development/test/production environments. For example: rvm manages different version of ruby environments on the same system. Bundler manages dependencies. The rake tasks manage setting up various environments. Yes, somewhere down the road where you're working with other people it may make sense to create docker images of your projects, but essentially if you have ruby & github on your computer then you can very simply share projects with other people.

I think the registration form is the most easily relatable since pretty much every app needs one

Otherwise it comes down to the object space of your application.

A checkout form - you need information for shipping and payment - those are probably two models under the covers and an email and some other workflow

doing 'something' as a guest on a website
you need to collect information about the user and the work or process

any complex workflow that you need to add to a form would probably benefit from a form object. aka go look at a controller - if it has anything other than really simple logic in it - that should be a form object. My personnel example is a work order - different users see different information, different types of work get different elements displayed, workflow transitions, routing to different URLs based on the outcome - it's friggen complicated! and the controller behind them before the refactor was hideous. after the move to a form object - free and easy controller code and *stupid* simple model specs instead of horrendous and slow controller/feature specs.",1516993534.0

In my app I use a form object for a feedback form where i'm not storing any info in the database, but im still doing some validation (needs to have a valid email and at least some body text). 

In this case i can do something like `form_for @feedback` and it works just as if I had an actual model.

2. Rails is a framework, You seem to be confusing it with a library.  the basic structure of the application is in place for you. You simply add to the MVC pattern

It didn't take long for people to realize that callbacks at the application level can fail in non-transactional ways (`dependent: :destroy`, for example is just a `before_destroy` callback, which can be halted for a number of reasons).

It's worth mentioning that Rails implements OO polymorphism using [Single Table Inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Table_Inheritance). This is done by adding two columns (object type, object ID) to a table. When querying a related object, ActiveRecord finds an associated record using the `type` to identify the table to join, and `id` to find the record. This prevents an FK constraint, since the constraint can't refer to multiple tables.

SkulloWorld,"My knowledge of the inner workings of SQL isn't great but I've had a few years of writing queries to know how to get the results I want. As a part of that, indexes have been essential when working with tables particularly that get into millions of rows.

Indexes nominally increase write time and by nature of storing more data require more storage, but massively decrease read time. For a majority of applications, the very slightly increased write time is well worth the tradeoff, it's really only very high-write low-read applications where an index may not be worth it.

As an example for the time saving of an index, I had a query that was taking ~30s to run, searching for an integer in a non-indexed row of a table containing approx 10,000,000 rows. After adding the index, the query returned in ~0.01s. Interestingly, the index only took about 10s to fully process and add to the table.

I don't remember what resources I used to learn about how to build appropriate indexes so I unfortunately can't point you in the direction of a specific book or site, but I strongly recommend doing reading on indexes and then apply the knowledge liberally.

For example, if the operation is expensive because it is constructing a large string like an XML snippet then it's probably best to store in it's own model. If the operation is expensive because it is a point in time sampling of your entire system then it might be best to never calculate it on demand and have a process that ensures that the rest of the system always has a sample point no older than some minimum threshold.

is actually true, then this might be a good case for caching. I'd encourage _not_ doing the caching initially until a profiler tells you to optimize that calculation (unless it already is). I would then see if there are other, easier optimizations you can do before caching. 

This mainly just comes from my experience dealing with a cache column getting written to a lot, getting out of sync, and not being a very expensive operation anyway (like multiplying two numbers). We then realized that we can't take this cache column out because customers said ""after I enable feature X in the system, then that column no longer gets updated, so we use it as a historical record.""

,"> wouldn't it be easier to just have the ""Category"" model just ""belong_to"" Articles? and Articles ""has_many"" Categories?

In this case the category would have to store the article_id. How then could a category belong to multiple different articles? You could have an array of article_ids but that gets inefficient. The extra table allows articles to have many different categories AND categories to have many different articles.",1516605523.0
welkie,"In this case, ```ArticleCategory``` is a junction model for which ActiveRecord will create a junction table. Each row in its table represents a particular article belonging to a particular category. This is a more complex and more powerful alternative to using ```has_and_belongs_to_many``` between two models, in which case ActiveRecord will create a junction table for you (which is necessary to track this in the database), but there will be no need for a junction model. You'd simply do queries like ```some_category.articles``` to get all of the articles for a category, and vice versa.

Concerning this approach, with the junction model ```ArticleCategory```, ActiveRecord still creates the junction table in the database to store these relationships, except this time it's created explicitly because you defined the model for it.

This means you can add more attributes to that model and now you can store data that pertains to this relationship, like a date field representing when the article was added to the category. (Kind of a dull example, usually these junction table rows have more interesting properties.)

Usually, when you're creating these junction models, you'll choose a more interesting name than simply concatenating the names of the junctioned models, but sometimes language doesn't have a good noun to describe them.

A classic example where this is possible is when you're junctioning ```Student``` and ```Course```, naming it ```Enrollment``` (a particular student being associated with a particular course is an enrollment). This example also has more interesting relationship data. You could have the date their enrollment begins, the date it ends, the grade they end up with... etc.

The ```has_many_through``` you see defined on the non-junction models in your code are there as a convenience for you, so that you don't have to go through the junction model manually if all you care about is data about an article or a category (but not the relationship between them). Without this helper, you would have to do things like this:

    categories = []
    article.article_categories.each do |ac|
      categories << ac.category

But instead, you can do this:

We really shouldn't leave such unexploded bombs lying around.

More conventionally, you could fake a left outer join in memory using a hash e.g. via

    grouped_products = Product.where(user: current_user).group_by(&:category_id)
    Category.all.map do |category|
      category.as_json.merge!(""products"" => grouped_products.fetch(category.id, []).as_json)
    end

There's much to dislike about this, though. It's ignoring the framework and doing your own loading and joining, outside of domain models, in an imperative style that's riddled with code smells.

With Rails 5 there is a more framework-based way, using with the *[Convert scopes to associations](https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/how-to-preload-rails-scopes/)* manoeuvre that I picked up from Justin Weiss.

First, create a scope on Product for products matching the current user:

    class Product
      scope :current_user, -> { where(user: Current.user) }
    end

Second, create an extra association on Category that's narrowed by this scope.

    class Category
      has_many :products_current_user, -> { current_user }, class_name: ""Product""
    end

Now you can simply preload that association and use it:

    Category.includes(:products_current_user).as_json(include: :products_current_user)

NB: if this is for an API where the JSON consumer expects a ""products"" field, then I'd write a jbuilder view that serializes to spec, in place of as_json. Structurally speaking that is better than pushing a client's expectation of field names down into our domain model.

However, keen-eyed readers will have already sensed a rat. Where is `Current.user` coming from? The answer is that Rails 5 allows us to make request-specific data available to models, as in e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/a/2513456/2118053, so if you haven't already, this solution also requires:

    module Current
      thread_mattr_accessor :user
      def self.reset
        self.user = nil
      end
    end

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      around_action :with_current_user
      #..
      private
        def with_current_user
          Current.user = current_user
          yield
        ensure
          Current.reset
        end             
    end

In the upcoming Rails 5.2 this approach will gain even more framework support via the introduction of [ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes](http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/CurrentAttributes.html). To some folks [the pattern is controversial](http://ryanbigg.com/2017/06/current-considered-harmful), since it sets a thread-specific global value.

So what you want to do is pass an array of `category_ids` from the form.  First, update you `shop_params` method in the controller by removing `shop_categories_attributes: [ :shop_id, :category_id]` and replacing it with `category_ids: []`.

in0pinatus,"Cumulative execution of multiple migrations is well known to be hazardous to your database structure. The Rails migration guide says ""*schema dumps are the authoritative source for your database schema*"" and it's for good reason: each migration is written with a specific revision of code & database schema in mind.

I've seen (and written) all too many migrations like this, adding a new column and populating it with calculated values:

    class AddPriceToItem < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
      def up
        add_column :items, :price, :integer
        Item.reset_column_information
        Item.all.each { |item| item.update(price: item.category.base_price) }
        change_column_null :items, :price, false
      end
      def down
        remove_column :items, :price
      end
    end

This works when initially written, but then a week later someone refactors the Category class to no longer have a `base_price` method because only Item was using it.  All the tests pass because tests don't cover migrations. Now the migration above is still in the codebase—but it throws a `NoMethodError` for the next device that checks out master and tries to run it. Boom.

Quite possibly boom in production, because you were doing integration deployment to test & showcase environments but not to prod. It's another reason to do continuous delivery all the way to production with Rails.

As a result, my deploy sequence requires migrations to only run in production against the git reference for which they were checked in, unless overridden by specific annotation from a tech lead. We also have a coding standard such that changes to data in a migration are only by SQL statements and not with invocation of application code.

I would advise that you avoid names that are too descriptive or straightforward, simply as a general branding practice (_e.g.,_ it’s “Chrome” not “Google WebBrowser”).

The software industry in general favors names that are memorable but not too explanatory; one reason this is important (in any industry) is that it allows competitors to enter the product space without having to compete over who gets the genericized name.

In the Ruby community, it’s common to name your project something a little cheeky, obscure, off-kilter, or otherwise clever. [It’s a practice that evokes strong opinions](http://unethicalblogger.com/2011/11/13/ten-poorly-chosen-gem-names.html), but I like it, personally.

For instance, here's the top comment from the article I linked above:

Of course, there are (as always) exceptions to this rule, and it generally applies less to web applications (for use by the general population) than gems (for use by programmers). Bundler comes to mind. GitHub also. FactoryBot is another, though it began as FactoryGirl, which was wordplay.

MidgetAbilities,"My company struggles with this, as we are approaching 500 models. This may not really answer your question, because it is more an organizational strategy and philosophy rather than class design pattern, but we are starting to use what we call ""concepts"" instead. The Rails default organizational model of grouping code by type (e.g. model, controller, etc.) is fine for a small application, but I don't think that scales.

Instead we have a folder `app/concepts`, and under that you put folders grouped by ""concept"", i.e. some feature of your application or business domain. Concepts can be nested of course. Under each concept you put all of the code for that concept, with whatever directory structure you need. This differs from how `lib` is used, because we put *everything* into a concept. This includes models, controllers, views, services, presenters, routes, abilities (for CanCan), etc.

We've found this has a lot of benefits:

1) When working on a feature, you are working mostly in a tiny part of the code base, so navigating the code is simpler.

2) Understanding the entirety of a feature is much easier when you know virtually all of the important code is in a single folder that you can easily explore. This helps onboard someone to the feature.

3) You can test an entire feature by just running the spec folder which mirrors the contents of your `app/concepts` folder. It's nice to be able to regression test a feature real quickly after you make some changes.

4) This approach makes you think harder about the concepts/domains in your application when creating new code, and hopefully you will be more thoughtful about how things are named and organized instead of just plopping a new model into the models folder and a new service into lib or the `app/services` folder if you have one.

5) We put a README in the root of each concept, which explains the basic concept/feature in business or product terms, as well as giving you the important entry-points to the code and maybe troubleshooting tips or pointers for running things locally.

6) We treat each concept as a sort of ""state's rights"" situation instead of having the federal government tell you how to do things. You want ""controllers"" and ""services"" modules inside of your concept? Go for it. You want to organize your concept such that each module is a logical sub-component of your concept instead? That's fine too (it's the way I prefer it). We don't want to be too prescriptive, and depending on how big or small the concept is, different organization may be simpler to follow.

7) If you have sub-teams which own features or logical parts of the code base, this organization could help.

I think the bigger picture benefit here is that you start to build out boundary lines between pieces of code. If concepts talk to each other, it should ideally be through a limited set of classes or entry-points. Someone at my company has even proposed an ""interface"" class you could have at the root of each concept which exposes all of the public functionality for that concept.

clumsy_shaver,"A few opinions (YMMV):

Two main issues I see are haphazard application state management and the conflation of the domain code with presentation code. The symptoms of this are conditionals littered through every layer of the codebase and overloaded domain classes.

**State Management**

You can think of any application as a giant statechart (finite state machine + concurrency, synchronization, orthogonal regions, etc). The database contains the current state, urls are used to trigger events (state transitions), and the app executes the specific actions corresponding to the state transition.

Unfortunately, state in most applications is overwhelmingly complex and so we don't explicitly track ""we are in state X, the available transitions are {a,b,c} and the resulting state is Y. Instead, we litter conditionals throughout the code to ascertain the current state and then execute the corresponding actions. This makes understanding the possible execution paths extraordinarily complex, as you have to be aware of every possible permutation spread across many files.

One way (the oft-recommended way) to eliminate these scattered state checks in OO is to use composition and dependency injection for representing the different execution paths. Pull as much of the state checking as possible to the boundary of your application and have that boundary layer choose the correct dependencies to inject into your domain classes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE (Sandi Metz)
https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries (Gary Bernhardt)


**UI Entities vs. Domain Entities**

Domain concepts are separate from their UI counterparts, even when the underlying data is the same. Creating separate entities to represent each (when needed) helps prevent overloading your classes by having them cater to both contexts.


**Other**

Many models are not top-level concepts, and only make sense within the context of a parent model. Only allowing these child models to be updated via the parent can greatly reduce the surface area you have to think about on a consistent basis and prevent Demeter violations/inappropriate coupling. Organizing your files and object hierarchies accordingly helps maintain ""bounded contexts"" which are easier to grok than huge global domain spaces.

awj,"TL;DR: I've gotten a lot of mileage out of Trailblazer-style operations, also it's worth your time to see if you can figure out how your team didn't address this *before* everything got ""terrible"".

I started down that path before Trailblazer started out (or at least before I came across it). At the time I was really worried about preserving the ActiveModel workflow/interface as it related to controllers. My take on it (called ""interactions"") uses `ActiveModel::Model` and `ActiveSupport::Callbacks` to provide much of the relevant pieces of the interface. So if you have some model `Foo` that needs an email sent whenever it is created you can capture that in a `Foo::Create` interaction, but it's still easy to substitute into code that was trying to instantiate and save `Foo` directly.

That said, and I honestly do not mean any insult by this, I think it might be a good idea to step away from tools/techniques and consider *why* your project ended up in this state. Do people on the team need more training in separation of concerns? Are you setting deadlines too short and finding yourself cutting a lot of corners with no post-rush cleanup? Is this consideration part of code reviews? What does your code coverage look like (unit testing is a great way to force this point)?

You likely do have a level-of-abstraction problem, but it's equally as important to try to figure out why your team didn't see that before now as it is to solve it now that you have it. In your own words you labelled like 2/3rds of your project (and nearly 100% of the business logic) as ""terrible"".

scotch_bright,"I think the architecture that works best is roughly described as follows:

1. Rails as an API only app

2. React as the front end

3. Everything is a CRUD operation. 

4. There are no other routes other than routes associated with resources. (Roy Fieldings REST, not the version of it that Rails projects usually have.)

5. The only resources in your app are NOT those backed by ActiveRecord models. There may be other resources (virtual resources) if you will and everything is a CRUD operation.

The most controversial among these is, ""How can everything be a CRUD operation?""

For this, you need to see point ""5"" from above.

Let me take an example: The use case you want to deal with is that a user wants to update his password. When the password is updated, if the user is of a particular role then you need to send him an email and an SMS. If the user is of some other role, you need to send him only an SMS. Finally, if the user is of a third role, you need to just update the password and not send out any communication.

This is a complicated use case with a lot of silly business rules. How do you implement this?

Now, you might shove this action into the User controller. But do not. What if there was another resource called ""user_password""? And that resource had the CRUD action of Update only?

Even though UserPassword is not a model, that has a ActiveRecord class, you can still have a route and a controller for it. It that controller you put in all your business logic in nice short functions that have a max of 3-5 lines per method and you will be golden.

Keep doing this and you will have a manageable app.

This idea is a little hard to appreciate. Also, it seems like surely not every use case can be handled this way. Let us take an extreme use case. One where there is no ActiveRecord model that can be clearly associated.

Extreme Use Case: When a button in the UI is pressed, a user retention report for the last 30 days has to be sent to a manager. (Now the user retention report can only be made considering 5 different models and there is no clear idea which model is more important)

Here too, you can have a resource like ""user_retention_report_request"" with a ""Create"" action. (By clicking on the button you are creating a request for a user retention report) Make a controller for that resource. Again, if you make things this way, the code dealing with the use case will all be in one class and easy to look at when you need to find it and update it. The route will be clear and readable and predictable.

A note on React front-end: React scales well with complexity. HTML is a tree and when we see a HTML document, we are usually looking at each and every leaf in order to work with one or 2 (which we actually need in that moment). React breaks everything into components. Each component is a leaf. When we want to change the behaviour/rendering of a leaf, we hone in directly on the leaf. We do not consider the whole tree and how everything is related. This helps us manage complexity.

When they are processed, only one or more js/css files are served, not the component scss/coffescript files. 


In a production environment, you generally would not want to reprocess the assets on *every* request. Therefore, in production, you would likely want to precompile the assets via:

### 1. What do you mean 'pass data to bootstrap modals'?

From the looks of [Bootstrap's documentation on modals](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/), the modal should be included within your view template. You don't “pass data” from Rails into the modal; you write the modal in your view template using ERB (alongside all your other page content), and when the user clicks on the appropriate button, it becomes visible. If I've gotten anything wrong at this point, please help me understand.

### 2. `link_to` is the wrong method to use for a form

> a modal drops down with some more options and a ""submit"" button.

It sounds like you're talking about a form here. You're performing a POST request and giving the user some options (data) to submit along with it. 

`link_to` _can_ be used to submit non-GET requests, but it _cannot_ be used to submit params (data) along with such a request. Instead, what you need is `form_with`.

### Proposed solution

So on your page, you've got a list of campaigns. You're probably iterating over a collection, like this:

    <% @site.campaigns.each do |c| %>
      <li><%= link_to c.name, site_campaign_path(@site, c) %></li>
    <% end %>

so just add a form somewhere inside your iterator like so:

    <% @site.campaigns.each do |c| %>
      ...
      <%= form_with model: c do |f| %>
      ...
      <% end %>

Paradox,"Yes.

Chrome, and many other browsers, natively support downloading multiple files at the same time. Chrome is even getting download acceleration in a future release that will parallelize as much as possible. I can't speak for any other browsers, but I know that chrome prompts the user if a site attempts to download multiple files, and the user has the option to reject or allow it.

----

Now for the meat and potatoes. Rails, being REST oriented, follows a fairly explicit request-response, in that each request can only have one response.^1 So you have to make that first request really count.

Here's what I would do. I would have a multi-download page that has all the URLs to download from embedded in a JSON object, which you could easily put in a `<script type=""application/json"">` tag. Have a script, either in your assets or embedded into the page, that reads that JSON object, and then fires off async requests to each file. As long as they have the proper mime type (from S3) the browser will start to download them.

----

Finally, some thought on other ways to do it. Downloading multiple files is somewhat of an anti-pattern, as demonstrated by all the hacks you have to do to make it work right. What might be a better approach is to write a short script that runs on AWS lambda. The script would receive the list of S3 keys, and start file streams from them sequentially, which you could then move into a Zip stream, which you could stream directly to the client. Doing it on lambda allows you to have scalability, keep your rails system from slowing, and ultimately not pay as much of a S3 transfer cost (since you could put the lambda in the same az as your s3 bucket).

----

Footnotes:

^1. I know with HTTP2 you can have the server send multiple files to the client, but thats still fairly complicated to get working in rails",1515117423.0
SminkyBazzA,"Long ago I 'solved' a similar problem (albeit at a much smaller scale) by using JavaScript to click a bunch of links in the page. I think the browser checks that the user wants to allow it the first time, but after that it worked. 

Not sure how it would handle many many links, but my guess is it would start a few and delay the rest, based on a maximum number of connections.

The proper way might be to do the zipping in the cloud, and use polling to check the status of the job, and ultimately fetch the URL of the zip. Have you checked S3 didn't already offer this functionality via their API?",1515108612.0
tongboy,"This type of problem extends well past rails/ruby - there are multiple ways and opinions to solve the problem.

I think you hit on two key points - how to handle the piping of data around and how/where to expose it to your consumers.

IMO form objects are a great way to handle the piping - whether you put multiple associated models behind one or only expose part of one its a great way to abstract form specific logic to an easily testable code piece without over complicating your model.

with form objects handling the how you expose that to your users becomes easier.

The basic rails concepts are very much around resources - of which most of the time a resource is tied to a model. that falls apart pretty quickly when your app is more than a todo app with a user and a list of items.

If you take a form objects pattern you might have multiple form objects that map to a model or a few but they are different resources to your end users.

a great example is a user model. they need to signup, then they need to fill in some additional information to be an admin and then they need to be able to do normal user maintenance (update emails, change password, whatever)

storing all of that data on a user model is fine (save that argument for a different example!) But trying to expose that as a single endpoint to your users would leave you fighting problems and your users confused if they looked at URLs.

instead you'd probably do something like

    /signup
    /profile
    /password

In your controllers your could just expose a user there for your views... But if you used a form object you're back to dealing with a 'resource' instead of a model

signup controller gets a `SignupForm.new` that exposes your username/password and has the appropriate validations

profile controller works with a `ProfileForm` that exposes those values and validations

and so on.

Now your controller actions are dealing with a single resource - instead of polluting your controller actions with managing interconnected models. Say a user has a company associated that needs to be created during signup. If you leave that in the controller you have to write complicated controller specs. If you instead pull that logic in to a form object you get straight forward model specs.

TL;DR resources don't have to be models. Follow REST principles but look to make sure you're finding all your actual resources - not just beating them to fit model concepts.",1515091626.0
in0pinatus,"I like option (3). Extracting a model and/or adding a controller are both excellent moves. There's a lot of gravity to Active Record models, resulting in them becoming god objects by accretion. Try to separate along boundaries of responsibility. `NameInformation` doesn't strike me as a great class identifier, though. How about just `Name`. And beware of N+1 issues; a preloading scope or query object may become essential for some views. Also note that some people have more than one name ;)

Note there are other ways to refactor. Active Record really does bond models to database tables, but you can extract classes using the [Attributes API](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Attributes/ClassMethods.html) or [`composed_of` aggregations](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Aggregations/ClassMethods.html).

For what it's worth, DHH is also known for controller proliferation.  You don't have to code like DHH to build useful things with Rails, but it really helps to try and understand his thinking. Have a listen to http://www.fullstackradio.com/32 sometime. This may also help you avoid the perfidious construction of service objects (c.f. Fowler, PoEAA, p137, “... when not to use it”).

Tip: don't get suckered into the false equivalence of controller->model just because that's the default scaffolding. REST is for routes, and for controllers by close collaboration; it doesn't have to extend into your domain model. You don't have to - in fact, you shouldn't - write a new resource model for every controller.

#### On form objects

Form objects seem like an unnecessary abstraction in the examples you've given, and premature abstraction is worse than premature optimization. In this case they'd just be shuttles for data down and errors up and maybe an extra validation (one that could easily have been a [context validation](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#on) on the model). So be sure to use them only when they justify their own existence.

I use additional models when there's real domain behaviour to implement, such as account creation, perhaps based on data we won't otherwise be persisting. In my more recent projects, onboarding is multi-step process modelled by a fully persisted Active Record domain object, `Signup`, that was extracted from the `Account` model, initially into a Concern, and then subsequently into a separate model.

We’ve been using light weight Vue components with a nice way to bootstrap them. The problem is when you need to share the same client side state between them.

It doesn’t happen very often, but a good example is a beginning at and ending at time field where changing the ending at should also affect the beginning at.

I’ve considered writing a plugin, but Vue doesn’t really want to work this way. It wants a single parent rather than many sibling components. 

When you’re doing the server side route you just want to enhance HTML rather than work against it.

I need to spend some time with Stimulus, but it looks like I’d be able to write isolated components like a date time field and then bind their state together with a parent controller. It doesn’t make too many assumptions.

magnopoly,"This advice is coming from a Ruby/Rails developer who started coding 1.5 years ago. I was homeless (living on friends couches) and literally not even able to buy food for myself. 

If you have a job... you need to be spending literally every minute you have off coding. If you have big enough balls... you need to quit your job and start freelancing on Upwork, toptal, ect. Youd be surpriesed how much work you can get that just requires basic Rails/Web knowledge. 

I spend my first 6 months of freelancing doing anything. Tutoring HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS stuff. After that I got a long term contract job paying $16/hr just doing basic rails stuff for a rails developer with his own mini agency. When i say basic I mean like doing CRUD stuff, adding views, and just adding basic features. Most of the tasks could be performed pretty easily by adding gems so the hardest part was just learning to read documentation well. 

After that I actually got an unrelated job and within a week I had built a mini app for that job to make the work flow 1000% easier. My boss loved it. Gave me a raise and commissioned me to expand on the app. Got paid $17k just for that app. I know that is an outlier example. I don't expect you to be able to replicate that although you'd be surprised how many opportunities fall into developers laps. 

Now, 1.5 years later... I work for a small company getting paid $85k/yr improving and maintaining their ruby/rails web app. This job was a freelance listing on upwork for ""locals only"" as it was an non remote office job. 

I still look at code challenges and am like ""WTF is this shit"". On codefight.com I think I only passed the first 2 or 3 interview questions before I gave up because I cant stare at code challenges all day and still make money lol.  Code challenges test your ability to problem solve. Not your ability to make money as a developer. 

To become a good developer you need to be DOING. You need to be repeating tasks over and over. You need that repetition so that it becomes second nature. When certain things become second nature it is then when you can step back, take a breath. Once you know ""what"" to do you will intuitively start to understand the underlying ""how"" and ""why"" the code works. 

My final advice is to JUST BUILD SOMETHING. My first app was a craigslist scraper. Never made a dime with it. But learned TONS with it. 

Follow the Mike Hartl rails tutorial, (Just google ""Mike Hartl""). There he details how to build a twitter clone app. I never even finished the tutorial as I was so excited to have learned the initial things he teaches that I struck out on my own and built my craigslist scraper. 

Once you build a few apps for fun... you're ready for freelancing. 

One last piece of advice is to FIND A MENTOR and stop hanging out with deadbeat friends who are distractions. You need to surround yourself with beautiful minds and motivated people. Find your local Ruby/Rails meetup and go there to meet developers, ask questions, and get help on sticking points. Make friends with people there. Developers love to help other developers. 

Having an awesome mentor ended up being the secret sauce to me reinventing myself as a web developer because he instilled in me the roadmap to becoming a great developer. He also helped me through a few tough and depressing times and remains my go to guy when I need consulting on issues that are over my head. 

TLDR: You dont need to understand code challenges to be a good dev. I make a good living as a developer despite only knowing how to code for 1.5 years. You will get better by DOING. Personal projects, and freelancing are both things you can do as a beginner. Take the steps and you will level up. ",1514518943.0
tongboy,"just keep doing it, all the time.

when you don't know the answer find it out, rinse and repeat. remember the important answers, remember how you *got* the answers for the less important/obscure answers. It's about the process, not the exact code output.

You will *never* have every perfect code pattern answer to every question you're asked - don't plan for that. Work to *know* the basics, then the next level, then the next level.

I think this chart shows the way I think of it well:
https://i.redd.it/rj7uydgmp4601.png

problem solving - and to a major point code development isn't about knowing every specific part of the languge and how to use it to solve every problem. It's about building a toolbelt of knowledge. It's going to take a long time to make a great toolbelt but as you add patterns that work, or solve problems you're adding tools to that belt. A lot of that knowledge is knowing *where* to go to get the answer you need. SO and search are critically important tools for that. Knowing the right coworker or source code project to look in are other common paths.

now the next time you see a similar problem you'll know that you worked on one before and have a place to maybe start researching or code to go look at. As your experience grows you have more existing knowledge to reach for. When you're able to combine a few different related problems to synthesize a new potential answer or place to start for a new but related problem - you're problem solving.

All of those tools you build up over your experience dull with time - you need to use them to keep them fresh in your mind. anyone that switches dev languages or hasn't done a task for a while can speak to that. You'll still remember the fundamentals but you'll be rusty. IMO the best way to get good at problem solving is to dive in with both feet and get to work - trying to slow play or wander around the edges means you're missing a lot of the bigger problem you're trying to solve",1514480228.0
isaacpriestley,"One approach you might take to coding challenges is to take a problem, and solve it first using all the available resources, including Google searching for solutions.

Then, let some time pass and try to solve it again, without using any resources but your memory.

Note that, even when you're searching, you can first use a whiteboard or sketch out your ideas about how you might solve it. Then, if you're stuck, look it up and read an English description of how to solve the problem, rather than code.

Then try doing some work based on just the description of how to solve it. Then, you might try looking at solutions from a different language, but coding them in Ruby instead.

For example, if you take a problem like ""Reverse a linked list"", you might find something like this link:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-linked-list/

It begins with a simple English description of how to solve it.

> Iterate trough the linked list. In loop, change next to prev, prev to current and current to next.

So, you could code something up in Ruby based solely on that description, and see how close you can get.

Then, if you don't solve it, you could look at the Java or Python code and try to translate it into Ruby.

Then, sometime later, start a new solution and try to solve it in Ruby from scratch without consulting the web or your original solution.

nickjj_,"Breaking down a problem into a smaller problem is a universal way to make troubleshooting and building things easier.

In your case of ""how to utilize Ruby to solve a problem"", the first thing you could do is rephrase that into ""how would I solve this problem?"".

Like, what's the problem in the first place? Do you fully understand the problem? If not, [try talking to a Rubber Duck](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/solve-programming-problems-with-rubber-duck-debugging) and fully explain your problem to it.

Sometimes not having a clear definition of your problem is the real problem, and talking or writing it out will help you there.

Now once you fully understand the problem at hand, you can begin to dismantle it. For example, ""building a billing system"" is a pretty hard problem at a first glance, but if you spend a while breaking it into identifiable smaller problems, then it becomes approachable.

For example, one part of a billing system is accepting payments. Ok, so now your mission is to figure out what's available for accepting payments. Ah ok, Stripe fits well here, so now you can read up on using Stripe's API to accept a payment. That's cool, it's almost like your mini-problems are actually things you could search for in Google.

Anyways, before you know it, you have this list of well defined small problems. Once you do this a few times, now you're left with ""use Stripe's Charge API to take a user's credit card and create the charge"". That's super defined and very approachable.

amplex1337,"EDIT: Sorry, I'm new here to r/rails but I have been coding since I was young.

I think the biggest task with learning how to problem-solve is learning how to compartmentalize or break down one large task into smaller tasks that all can be executed separately.  Basically this is the art of programming.  Sit down and start with pseudo-code to break apart how you would conduct each step of the path to get to what you want.  If you can't do this, you cannot solve the problem.  You have to understand the problem before you can solve it.  And like others have said, don't ever start out with code unless its something very tiny.  I used to use GCC instead of a calculator to solve math problems in college, at times.  This was a very good habit to get into as it helped me excel later on in breaking down problems mathematically.

It is hard to know exactly how to go from writing simple code to architecting great solutions, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't try to practice breaking apart small problems.  Try to automate as many things as you can.  Try to break problems down to a point where the things you've learned along the way can be applied.  Sometimes this process might take longer than the actual coding.  As applies to many things technology related, often times Perfectly defining the problem is what truly leads the way to providing the correct solution.",1515102055.0

in general what you need to balance is productivity and process. 'orthodox' agile IMO has more process then productivity - this is especially true on smaller teams.

quick daily reviews to make sure people aren't trampling on each other and things like that are great in any size team, the rest of the agile processes are pretty heavy handed on a 2-4 person team.

If you have 5% test coverage, yeah, uh, no amount of process is going to fix that.

You need to put up guard rails so new people are confident they aren't breaking things and can instead spend time adding new features. With 5% test coverage people have ZERO assumption anything they change/refactor won't cause critical issues. That slows down people getting features out right away and *always* reduces your teams throughput. You need to fix that before *anything* else.

Take those 16hrs/week and throw ALL of them at test coverage. Even basic 'this code got run'. is better than 5% test coverage.

TanyIshsar,"I work in health tech. We have what I like to call the 'claims problem'. It's like the rocket problem in that you have to spend some asburd multiple on data validation & ingest for every single feature you deliver.

Having said that, your biggest problem is almost certainly going to be data quality.

* Implement a layered ingest system that allows you to isolate out custom transformations cheaply. This will let you give good estimates when someone walks in and says ""<Major Client 22> doesn't have SSNs, they have SSNs interspersed with x's and leading zeros. We need this in the system by yesterday."".

* Implement tracing and granular monitoring from the get go. You'll need to answer questions like ""Why is patient X for customer P in district T on doctor 8's screen not showing real time blood pressure?"". So make sure you can identify what all the variables are and push that burden off to support.

* Security sucks, but needing to test in PROD *AND* deal with security obligations is worse. Containerize from the start. You shouldn't go to market unless you can spin up an identical to production cluster at the click of a button. This will allow you to avoid all the super costly paperwork of debugging in PROD 9 times out of 10.

* UI/UX for EMR is brutal. 'Customization' sells, but can obliterate good architecture in under ten seconds. Don't fly into this blind; pressure the business to survey at least a few dozen prospective clients with questions designed around validating the business value of customizable UIs. It might be worth building an architecture that supports a UI that can be configured by the clients via a drag and drop experience. Or it might be a complete and utter waste of time.

* Recognize that this industry is B2B2C. Your Company sells to Hospital/Hospital Group who sells to Doctor/Nurse/Healthcare Victim. This means you're going to have a LOT of analytics requests flowing in from your clients (the hospitals/hospital groups). Keep that in mind as you design your data model and invest early in ETL or other replication strategies. You don't want the analytics team poking around in your production master. The slow query log will make intercontinental cruises look fast.

* You're B2B2C, this means your company **WILL NOT SUCCEED** unless doctors/nurses/sick people like your UI/UX, however they don't pay the bills. This means you will have to balance competing requirements from the B and the C sides. The B side should win every time there isn't a clear detriment to the C side.

In PoEAA I use the pattern Service Layer to represent a domain-oriented layer of behaviors that provide an API for the domain layer. This may or may not sit on top of a Domain Model. In DDD Eric Evans uses the term Service Object to refer to objects that represent processes (as opposed to Entities and Values). DDD Service Objects are often useful to factor out behavior that would otherwise bloat Entities, it's also a useful step to patterns like Strategy and Command.

So by all means use them - but don't fall into the trap (that we've seen all too often) of making them a PHP-like junk-drawer for procedural code. The better alternative is almost always a rich domain model in which behaviour emerges from the composition of the objects.

STI:

    Pros: 
    * Simpler implementation in general
    * Less references cross database (difference is stored in-table as 'type' column)
    * Easiest implementation of a standardized interface
    ------
    Cons:
    * Adding a column to the supermodel adds it to ALL inheritors
    * Features from one model tend to be reused incorrectly inside inheritors if not watched carefully (oh this 'event_date' column isn't being used for this STI type... let's just use that for the timestamp instead of adding a migration!) 
 
Polymorphic:

    Pros:
    * Completely independent data storage in tables 
    * Clearest differentiation of models prevents most issues with one affecting the other
    ------
    Cons:
    * No interface required so you definitely can shoot yourself
    * References are cross database (can be harder to track down what you're looking for)

Make sure anything you reference is not too dated. You can filter search results down to the last year in advanced search options.

When dealing with an issue with a technology you are using, let's say postgres for example, don't be afraid of the official documentation. Official docs can be a bit terse at first, but may help you learn more useful information around the domain of your problem.

When referring to GitHub readmes, make sure you know what version of the gem you are using. By default, the source of the readme will likely be for a version ahead of the one you are using, and if important APIs changed across major versions, you will have to go back to the version of the readme for the version of the gem you are using.

For what you explain, the source code you are working on is doomed. Try to find another job as soon as possible. My advice: at some point in the interview with the next company, ask them their opinion about code quality and best practices. If they give you a really passionate answer, take the job.

Psychocist,"> I haven't found a company to give me a chance yet but I'm not really into mass applying because, as an example, I would rather earn £50 per day working and learning from the very best and passionate rails developers in the world than earn £500 within a stale environment where people don't push one another to do great things.

It really depends on your aims. I have no intention of moving on from Rails because, after 8 years programming, I'm confident I can tool myself up for most jobs, and there is plenty of legacy Rails stuff going around to keep me busy.

On top of that, programmers are in one of the most powerful positions: we are capable of creating software from scratch; we can piece together different services and libraries and create our own services and libraries and turn those into income streams. You will never receive what you're worth at a company -- that's how they run a profit.

I remember a few instances when I was employed where I was solely responsible for a few features that ended up either saving or generating the company $$,$$$/month. Sure, scale is a big part of that -- but I earned them more in a single month than I was paid the entire year. That's why employment is a fool's game.

I freelanced for a while (4-5 years) to cut my teeth on something, then got a full-time Ruby job which I held down for a few years. I recently quit that to go back to freelancing -- first because I can earn upwards of $80/hr, and no job can compete with that, and, secondly, I only have to work 10-15 hours a week, I can travel where I please (currently in Thailand).. while I have more time to do what I want to do and build a software business. If you absolutely MUST have a job, then at least look for a remote long-term position. Granted, would be a lot more difficult without any commercial experience.

My advice - work with whatever technology you want and go build something for yourself before you try to make it in the corporate world and slave away for the rest of your life climbing the career ladder. That should be your LAST resort, not your first goal. The beauty of that is you can build whatever you want in whatever technology you want! There are plenty of profitable software businesses out there run by solo entrepreneurs that are running on nothing but spaghetti PHP that struggle to adapt and evolve because of it. We can do a lot better.

Use the power of rapid prototyping in Rails to go and test a bunch of different application ideas, get them in front of users, get feedback, work on monetising, work on marketing, read The Lean Startup and Rework and The Platform Revolution. Learn skills and knowledge that give YOU more power, instead of giving the best of your creativity, intelligence and ingenuity to an employer who will pay you a percentage of what you're actually capable of generating. Surely you at least owe that to yourself before you throw in the towel and resign to being a code monkey who takes instructions from others?

Having said all of this, one great benefit of employment is that, if you're surrounded by great developers, you can quickly hone your craft. I'm definitely a much better developer because of the 3 years I spent in full-time employment, surrounded by 40 other Ruby developers. I could have seen the same benefits after probably 12 months. Don't get comfortable.

An interesting point is that I'd actually be peddling the OPPOSITE message if I was an employer (which you will be one day if you follow this path)! :P

wheresdagoldat,"A couple of thoughts, not necessarily related or in any particular order:

1) if you want to do web dev, you do need to learn a JavaScript framework, and there’s not really any escaping from that. Front ends are getting more complex, and it’s honestly just easier to do it in something like React than to mess around with Rails views and asset pipelines. The world is also moving away from monolithic web apps toward, for example, an API that feeds both a front-end and a mobile app. I would recommend React over Angular, because it’s easier to get productive with, and it forces you to learn about the DOM and how your browser works, rather than abstracting it all away like Angular does.

2) Its worth diversifying from Rails for the sole reason that it will provide you with a different view on software development, and will shine a light on areas where you lack understanding. One could theoretically build a complex Rails app without a solid understanding of HTTP or SQL, both of which are absolutely fundamental pieces of web development. It will also expose you to more subtle differences. Things like the relative pros and cons of relational vs nosql databases, or the relative merits of the ecosystems around different languages. These are major parts of programming, and won’t come up if you’re stuck solely in the rails world. 

3) You’re not going to do anything in software development for the rest of your life. The web has barely been around 20 years. Tech changes quickly. Rails will be around for several more years, but it would be a mistake to learn one piece of tech and try to ride it for the rest of your life. You want to almost always learning a big new piece of technology. No need to force this though. As you get deeper in, you’ll automatically get more interested in a greater diversity of tech. 

And rails isn’t neccessarily going anywhere. It’s still a very solid, very mature, framework. But it isn’t the only game in town, and it’s isn’t the answer to every problem. I would say get started by learning some React, firing up an API-only Rails app, and building a React front-end for it. You also get React Native almost for free, so you can build a mobile app for this application as well. I can almost promise it will make you a much more effective developer. ",1513344522.0

There is nothing wrong with Rails, just don't get too married to it. Anyone who says X framework is the best and you should ditch Y is probably full of shit and thinks they know more than they do. All the major relatively well used langauges and frameworks have good uses and bad uses, pros and cons. It is good to understand different frameworks and languages, it makes you adaptable, it is also good to be able to recognize what certain languages and frameworks are best for.

kobaltzz,"I'll extract the strong params from the controller into its own classes. So for something like `content`,  I would call `permitted_params.content_attributes`. Within my `content_attributes` it would make a call out to the `bank_attributes` and `barber_attributes`. This way my controller steers clear of having to manage what a user has access to as well as having all of the logic of handling which parameters to include in one nice namespaced place.

kobaltzz,"The main thing for extracting logic is to extract responsibility and complexity. It makes it easier to test as well as maintaining the code.

If your model is very simple and doesn’t have any kind of restrictions of who can edit what, then extracting the strong parameters to its own class may be overkill. However, if you have logic where an attribute can only be edited by certain roles, then things can get complex and ugly quickly.

For example, you have an attribute called role on a user model and you do not want anyone to be able to edit their role. However, an admin of the site should be able to edit the role. For everyone else, the app should treat it as a parameter not permitted. The BL for this can be quite complex depending on the application and having the strong parameters extracted will reduce the complexity and make it more maintainable as other areas of the application can simply check if the user is permitted to edit an attribute. If they’re not permitted then do not display the field.",1513520037.0

jahfer,"I work on the team at Shopify which recently did something very similar to what you're asking for (I think). Up until last year, we maintained a ""standard"" Rails folder structure, but given the [size of our codebase](https://web.archive.org/web/20170126202449/https:/twitter.com/tobi/status/819246328211443713) (2.3k models, 450 controllers, 370 jobs), it became difficult to onboard new developers and maintain a proper boundary between persistence, business logic, and application infrastructure.

The structure we decided on is as follows:

    .
    ├── Gemfile
    ├── Gemfile.lock
    ├── README.md
    ├── components
    │   ├── component_a
    │   │   ├── README.md
    │   │   ├── app
    │   │   ├── component.yml
    │   │   ├── lib
    │   │   └── test
    │   ├── component_b
    │   │   ├── README.md
    │   │   ├── app
    │   │   ├── component.yml
    │   │   ├── lib
    │   │   └── test
    │   └── component_c
    │   │   ├── README.md
    │   │   ├── app
    │   │   ├── component.yml
    │   │   ├── lib
    │   │   └── test
    ├── lib
    ├── test
    └── etc...

All of that replaces the root-level `app/` folder, though truth-be-told, we still have a root-level app folder for a handful of things (e.g. `app/assets`).

To actually wire all of this together for Rails wasn't particularly complicated. We had to make a few tweaks to `config/application.rb`:

    shopify_domain_dirs = Dir[""#{Rails.root}/components/*/app/""].map { |f| File.dirname(f) }
    shopify_domain_dirs.each do |dir|
      %w(
        app
        app/controllers
        app/models
        app/helpers
      ).each do |path|
        config.paths[path] << ""#{dir}/#{path}""
      end

      lib_dir = ""#{dir}/lib""
      if File.directory?(lib_dir) && !$LOAD_PATH.include?(lib_dir)
        $LOAD_PATH << lib_dir
      end
      config.autoload_paths << ""#{dir}/lib""
    end

All of that being said, I think some extra folders inside `app/models`, etc. can get you a long way towards your goal without having to resort to the sort of structuring I've described here. ",1513258234.0

ignurant,"The summary is this:

- Add the gems to act as your database adapter/driver
- Add a connection to database.yml
- Add a model

First, figure out which version of the drivers you should use. This appears to be a popular option https://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced It will have you add two gems -- one is the db driver interface, and the other is the activerecord driver.  It looks like you may need to install this as well on any machine that wants to use the oracle driver. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html

Now, add your connection to database.yml as a separate connection. 

    reindeer_reporting_db_or_any_sensible_name:
      adapter: oracle_enhanced
      database: northpole
      username: santa
      password: secret

This goes anywhere in your database.yml file in addition to the existing connections.

Now for the code. Instead of writing the properties for this connection directly to our model we plan to use, we're going to create a base class to inherit from. This has multiple advantages:

* Better handling of the connection pool
* Is more re-usable if you need to add or tweak other views or tables
* Keeps the connection code further away from the business logic in the actual model

So, cook up something similar to these fellas: 

    # app/models/reindeer_reporting_db.rb
    class ReindeerReportingDB < ApplicationRecord # or ActiveRecord::Base
      
      # Specify as an abstract class so that this class doesn't try to hook up to
      # a table, or get instantiated.
      #
      self.abstract_class = true

      # Specify the connection we are using from config/database.yml
      #
      establish_connection :reindeer_reporting_db_or_any_sensible_name

      # Since this is targeting a view, let's make sure ActiveRecord complains 
      # if we try to mess with it.
      #
      def read_only?
        true
      end
    end

    # app/models/reindeer.rb
    class Reindeer< ReindeerReportingDB
    end

Now you can use this connection like any other AR model:

    # app/controllers/reindeer_report_controller.rb
    class ReindeerReportController
      def index
        # Using it is now just like using any typical AR model.
        @reindeer = Reindeer.all
      end
    
      def show_that_thing_with_that_one_guy id
        @guy = Reindeer.find id
      end

      def cook_books
        reindeer = Reindeer.find my_buddy
        reindeer.contact_quality = 100
        reindeer.first_call_resolution = 100
        reindeer.revenue_per_fte = RIDICULOUS_NUM
        reindeer.absenteeism_rate = 0
        reindeer.save!
        # => ! SomeSortOfError: Cannot write to read only model something grumble.
      end
    end

The code above may not work exactly as written, but it should give you the idea.

Then, from my rails app, I’m only ever needing to have a single dB connection to my postgresql dB 

For really big production tables, I usually create local materialized views to cache the data I need and create indexes that might not be available otherwise.  I guess it depends on your use case, but I never need real time access to our production data, so refreshing views on a daily basis is good enough.

real_fanpuns,"In your case, I would certainly return some kind of message, but don't return messages/keys to be consumed by particular clients, that seems like the API knowing too much about the client that will be consuming it's responses. You can always override API messages based on status code or ignore them completely and display something else in the front end.

That was my short version, if your interested, this was my journey working with Rails APIs:

When I first started playing with the API mode, I was tempted over define the responsibility of the API because I was thinking about the application too narrowly. I knew vaguely that I wanted other apps (e.g. a mobile app) to be able to plug into the API, but I was really only developing for the web app use case that I was most familiar with. IMO the thing that helped me the most was to try to apply the lessons from Sandi Metz's [POODR](http://www.poodr.com/) about OOP design and try to decouple as much as possible (it's actually easier with an API because you have to think in messages and interfaces). I'm sure other people have written about this and there's probably people writing about REST that's more on-point, but her book was the first one I read/studied.

To do this, I imagine myself working on the front or back end independently, e.g., (1) I'm an API developer who is making an API that will be consumed by people I haven't met and will never know all their use cases or (2) I'm a front end developer and I have this API, but no ability to influence or change it. 

This made my API development much more generic (in a good way) and my front end design much more flexible. Whenever I caught myself saying, ""I'll put this specific message/input here so that I can easily consume it or work with it"" I had to stop an say no, ""how would I write this if I didn't know who/what would be consuming/sending it in the future"". Whenever I wanted to make a change in the side I wasn't working on, I made myself ""justify"" it to the other team.

In the end, I control both, so it doesn't make sense to take this too far; sometimes it is better/easier to use what you know already about how the program will work (or if we stick with one of Metz's analogies, for some projects, especially if you are the only developer, the perfect OOP solution is actually more cumbersome than a quick fix that works), but as a general exercise, I found it very helpful.",1513854995.0

Polymorphism is the most powerful tool to handle variations / exceptions in logic. It has to be used in conjunction with factories that hold the decisions about which variations should be used - instead of sprinkled around the entire codebase, they'll be isolated to this one place.

The problem is that that opens up a significant security hole.

So if someone makes `params[:store]` evaluate to `User`, they could potentially write to your users table instead of the savingstars table.

Anyway, if you're sure you know what you're doing, the method you want is `.safe_constantize`, as in `params[:store].safe_constantize.create(...)`.  What `safe_constantize` can be called on any string and turned into a constant.

ryanlue,"The objective, material benefits of one development environment or another are dubious at best. People get good at the tools they use every day, and some tools let you do things that others don't. Vim, emacs, sublimetext, atom, or full-blown IDEs — they're all used by the best engineers in the world. Not a few experienced engineers have switched editors at some point, [even late in their careers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWD1Fpdd4Pc).

Pick any one of the ~5 most popular and just learn it. Either you will be satisfied or get frustrated with its limitations/complexities and switch to something else. Vim is a commitment, and it sounds like you're looking for someone to tell you it's worth it, and how to get started.

It's as arbitrary a choice as any. Since vim is already on your radar, just go for it instead of soliciting the opinions of the crowd. You can start by checking out /r/vim. Any question you could possibly have at this stage has been asked (and answered) there more than once.

**EDIT:** but to pre-empt the questions you've already asked to other commenters, my advice is to start small. Vim is hands-down the single most thoroughly-documented software package I've ever seen. Use it. Spend time getting to understand it before you look to third-party blog posts / talks / screencasts to show you all the fancy tricks it can do.

Once you finish `vimtutor`, use vim to edit some kind of text file on a daily basis (ideally not code, yet — keep notes of your studies, maintain a todo list, track your expenses with beancount, whatever). As the basic features become second-nature to you, read the helpdocs to find out what every single key does in normal mode (`:h a`, `:h b`, `:h c` ... `:h Z`). A good exercise at that point is to start building your `.vimrc`. /r/vim and vi.stackexchange.com will be good resources along the way.

Paradox,"VIM is an editor yes, but its also an approach to editing.

Once you learn the basics of vim movement, objects, and the few mutation commands (replace, delete, substitute, yank, put), you can combine these into extremely powerful chunks.

One I use quite often for method extraction is `yaf`, which stands for `y`ank `a`round `f`unction. It yanks the current method, including its `def` and `end` blocks, and sticks it in a register, so I can paste it anywhere I want.

And the VIM approach to editing isn't limited to vim. There are vim plugins for most editors out there, even emacs. I use [vim-mode-plus](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus) for atom, which is fairly powerful and has a lot of features you'd need plugins to reproduce in native vim.

janko-m,"Videos are large so you'll likely want the uploads to be resilient to flaky internet connections, as few things are more frustrating than having to retry large uploads.

There is an open source resumable upload protocol, [tus](https://tus.io), for which there exist [Ruby](https://github.com/janko-m/tus-ruby-server) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client) implementations. I created a [demo application](https://github.com/janko-m/shrine-tus-demo) which shows how to use it with [Shrine](https://github.com/janko-m/shrine). I don't know how well it can work with other file upload gems.

In any case just make sure that whichever file upload library you'll be using doesn't load whole files into memory (e.g. [CarrierWave does](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/issues/1780)), or your servers will quickly run out of memory. Shrine and most likely ActiveStorage handle large files well. Also, note that [Paperclip hasn't received maintenance for a long time](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/issues/2477).

EDIT: You'll also need to transcode uploaded videos, which will need to be done in a background job. Paperclip and CarrierWave don't have good backgrounding support, but Shrine and most likely ActiveStorage do. You can either do transcoding yourself using `ffmpeg` or use a transcoding service like Zencoder, Amazon Elastic Transcoder or Transloadit (for the last one there is [shrine-transloadit](https://github.com/janko-m/shrine-transloadit)).",1512602609.0
markrebec,"Sounds like you're on the right track.

I would recommend leaning towards elasticsearch over solr as the underlying document index/search engine, and taking a look at their suite of gems for ruby/rails. I guess it kinda depends how much you care about modifying queries, facets, filters, etc... There are plenty of ""solr vs elasticsearch"" articles out there to help make an informed decision, though.

If the search side of things is new to you, then you might be able to get away with prototyping your app using `LIKE` SQL queries. Once you've got things working mostly how you like, you can spend time learning about running solr/elasticsearch service, indexing documents, querying those documents, etc. without feeling like you're getting sidebarred from your main goal. Once your index is up and running/populated, you can swap your `LIKE` SQL queries for callbacks to your search service.

Re: file uploads, I personally prefer `carrier_wave` over `paperclip`, but that's just because I've defaulted to using it for every new project for years now.

If the files are small enough (i.e. less than 10MB or so), I guess you can read the file's data by using the `download` method, and then resize it. Also, you can use `filename` to retrieve the original filename.

If you need to write the data to a file to process it with an external process, just use `File` or `Tempfile` to write it into a file:

     ""staff"" => 1,
     ""company"" => 2,
     ""admin"" => 3
    }

If I use `current_user.role`, it will return the string instead of the integer. I added a couple of methods in my User model to make it a little easier to check for each role, such as `author?` and `admin?`. 

This system relies on an Administrator using a select dropdown to set which role a new user will be assigned (I use a gem that sends an invitation email for the new user to set their password and removed Devise's default registration routes). If you want a default role to be set upon registration, you can generate another migration to set a default of `1`on the `:role` column, for example. If I wanted a Company to be able to invite new users with a role of Staff, I'd just have to make sure that the role is being set appropriately in the create method of the respective controller.

You can use a gem such as [cancancan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) to check for roles to ensure that Staff can't access Admin-related parts of the site. For instance, just add something like `before_action :verify_admin` to a controller full of actions only an admin should be allowed to access and then in that method, raise an error, set a flash message, and redirect as you see fit.

In my project, Companies and Staff have publicly viewable profiles that are structured differently. Also, I wanted Companies and Staff to have a `has_many` association. This is easily solvable.

- A User `has_one :company_profile` and also `has_one :staff_profile`.
- A CompanyProfile `belongs_to :user` and `has_many :staff_profiles`.
- A StaffProfile `belongs_to :user` and `belongs_to :company_profile`.

Just remember to set up your migrations for each model to reflect these associations or you'll have a bad time (`t.belongs_to :company_profile`, etc)

When a new user is created, I check which role is being assigned and have my create action for my UsersController create either a new CompanyProfile or StaffProfile. Here's what I did:

    if @user.save
      case @user.role
      when ""company""
         company = @user.create_company_profile
         redirect_to edit_company_profile_path(company.id)
      when ""staff""
        staff = @user.create_staff_profile
        redirect_to edit_staff_profile_path(staff.id)
      else
        redirect_to admin_users_path, :flash => { :notice => 'User was successfully created.' }
      end
    end

This way, you can have unique fields for each role without cluttering up your User model. Just remember to make controllers for each profile so you can have routes like `/company/:id` and `/staff/:id` to view each profile.

If I want a page to look different based on which role a signed in user has, that's super easy.

    = render :partial => ""#{current_user.role}_menu""

You just have to make sure that you have partials called `_author_menu`, `_admin_menu`, etc.

To handle redirection upon logging in, you just need to add a method to your **ApplicationController**. Here's what I ended up doing at one point:

    def after_sign_in_path_for(resource)
      case resource.role
      when 'admin'
        admin_sign_in_path
      when 'company'
        company_sign_in_path
      else
        staff_sign_in_path
      end
    end

You can do the same thing for the `after_sign_out_path_for` method if you want a different route for each role after they sign out.

BadCriticism,"To preface this, I'm just a guy who finished his universities introduction to Rails course, so my knowledge of rails is limited, but this is some very basic rails stuff your asking and it sounds like you haven't done much on rails so far. 

From my personal experience, it might be more efficient to learn the very basics of creating an app with Rails before asking how to specifically do something. This will save time in the long run. 

I suggest checking out this rather [quick tutorial on how to create a blog app](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html). So that you understand how to build the individual parts of REST (as it sounds like you want to do anyway), rather than using scaffold to generate code you don't understand.

Also, if you're interested in learning more Rails, then you can try the [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails). Which helped me understand the basics of Rails.

ruby-solve,"the scaffolding generators just created some boilerplate for you.  I believe you can go in and edit the files it creates for yourself like you would do for any other file in the project.

1.  Delete the new.html.erb and edit.html.erb for the model.  Edit index.html.erb and show.html.erb to remove links to those pages.

2.  Delete the new, edit, update, create, and destroy actions in the model's controller.  (I'm assuming you're using restful routes).

3.  Delete the routes for those actions from the config/routes.rb file.  

It probably reads something like:

    resources your_model

change this to:

    resources your_model, only: [:index, :show]

That should do what you want to remove any trace of the ability to create, edit, or delete records for that model.
