Sometimes you have to use a companie's UI guideline / kit. For example if they are using a material design UI dev-kit it really helps if you stick as close as possible to the developer's toolbox.

Sometimes you don't get paid enough to do something original.

Now with the current trends of design a UI kit is often not needed. Websites for example are mostly flat and defined by their imagery / typography and animation.

I was a product manager in all but name and was responsible for every aspect of a certain survey software that we were developing. I left since work was very stressful, I had a bad boss, and our Chairman had been fired for purchasing the services of a prostitute with company money. The new chairman instituted a hiring freeze, and started the process of selling off the division I was working for. I saw the imminent layoffs/restructuring coming, and decided to get out upstream of it and got accepted to design school. 

The thing is, part of why I left was that I had studied economics and had joined hoping to do data analysis work, which did not happen. Instead I was thrust into this role with no training and a boss in a different time zone. It was a mess I had no support and my productivity suffered.

Some do it because they're control freaks, but in my experience most people do it because they're just trying to do their job to the best of their ability. They think they're doing the right thing.

At your level, your role is really about building bridges and relationships that, in the long run, remove obstacles for your team. So there will come times where you have to decide if something is a hill worth dying on. The unsubscribe thing is a perfect example. It's terrible UX, yes. There might be legal ramifications depending where you live, totally. If the unsubscribe process is super crappy, maybe you all just work really hard further up the chain so that users rarely ever unsubscribe. So is it worth the fight and hurting that relationship? Especially since you're brand new you'll have to walk this line very carefully. Giving some ground on the little stuff while making clear what your position on the matter is will go a long way to building trust, rapport and good will for when the really big critical matters come to fore.

As for users unsubscribing, remember that at the end of the day it’s a business and it _is_ bad for you guys that they unsubscribe. Your job isn’t to prevent the PM team from creating a roach motel (though you should do that anyway), but to use it as a teachable moment to discover why users are unsubscribing and address it so that it leads to more revenue.

Courses like psychology helps for more behavioral science and high-level wireframes. UX research is a great skill that belongs here.

For example, how a hospital approaches walk-in patients - which staff do the patients come into contact with and when, crafting the patient's experience from walk-in to discharge, etc.

More often than not, the term ""UX"" is used in reference to digital environments but can be applied to physical products/environments as well. IIRC Don Norman uses several examples of how UX applies to physical objects in *The Design of Everyday Things*.

edit: I don't think service design is discussed here often, but we'd welcome it :)",1543382549.0

moonman77,"The definition of types of design and their hierarchy (I.e. UX, Service, Product) is not in the dictionary and will forever be debated on! Here’s my thoughts. 

On paper I will say UX design usually does refer to digital environments. But in practice and reality  I’ve seen a UX designers role extend to process or ‘service’. It really should! Let’s say you design a new the UX of a new digital ordering system for McDonalds, then you have to think of the service process. 

THAT BEING SAID. I don’t think they are interchangeable. As being a holistic service designer requires thought and influence around more sides than just the digital. In this McDonalds example you may design the operational process of a cashier, cook, etc as well. ",1543399994.0

You can apply UX to service design, and especially service design experience plays a huge role! But then again you can also apply LED design to  service design. Which is another process than UX. ",1543404459.0

In my experience, a lot of academics did not practice what they preached. They talked about the importance of being 'human-centered', without driving to deliver a better educational experience for their students/users, not being empathetic. ignoring feedback and being resistant to change. Staff that were excellent and brought the passion were overlooked for more senior positions because they did not have the 'qualifications' that more senior academics had, despite their industry experience.

Likewise there's a pretty huge amount of research if you're doing a good job and work somewhere without dedicated UX Researchers (which is very common, I do both). If you're feeling exhausted by research, again, this path may not be for you.

If you're motivated to go into a career because of ample availability of positions, I can see why dev or UX appeal, but I can't recommend UX because I don't consider it a 'get skills quickly and off you go' career. It tends to be very vocational, and people usually do well at it because they're passionate. Things change quickly in the industry so everyone has to embrace self-instruction at some point, otherwise you become irrelevant.

Ezili,"> I feel like designing a good Landing Page is like creating a piece of art

I'd challenge that. The goals of a landing page are quite different to those of art. What are the objectives of your design? How well does it accomplish that goal?

It's totally up to you and your organisation about whether the objective of your design is purely aesthetic appeal but I suspect it's not. Other stakeholders might be able to give you more input into what is trying to be achieved by the page, or from users about what they are trying to do on the page, such that you can come up with a more complete understanding of your goals which will lead you to a better design. I would strongly urge you to consider that the best landing pages you've seen weren't designed with the sole purpose of being pretty. ""Looking great"" is such an open criteria that it's not going to lead you to a good conclusion. 

For example, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) has a great landing page. But not just because it's pretty. If the inspiration you took from it was just to try and make yours look as good you'd be missing why it's effective. ",1542915459.0

manamachine,"Do you have more details you could add to your question? Are you talking about discussions over small details (colour choices, etc.) of an existing design? Are you talking about the practice holistically and its value? 

In my experience, debate happens mostly in two scenarios:

* when team members / clients without UX backgrounds try to speak intuitively about UX to a designer who has usually already considered their angle, and about 20 more
* when not enough testing has been done


If we assume two people are equally practiced and educated in design, we tend to see disagreements due to the following:

* Design conventions tend to be based on heuristics. It's difficult to meet all of them, and depending on business goals, some will take priority over others. There may be disagreement regarding the value of ""rules"" vs. user expectations

* Lack of budget, time, etc. does not always allow for things like A/B testing. On the surface two, or three, or more, solutions can look equally plausible--maybe with different priorities based on assumptions about end users. You may see hesitation about which choice to go with if designers are constrained to fewer choices than ideas. 


Probably a few more things, but I see this in nearly every project I work on. And as for the last section, it often happens in my own head if there's no one else around to challenge me.

CreativeRequirement,"The big raging debate I see in UX (and in the wider design profession as well) is : what responsibility do we have - if any - to protect consumers from the things we design. /u/manamachine is touching on this already.

Should we say no if we are asked to design an addictive game for kids that is meant to trick them into microtransactions, for example? If you listen to design podcasts, you will hear interviews with many people (such as the creator of the pop-up window and the creator of the facebook like button) who now believe that they what they did was wrong or at least should be reconsidered. 

As far as the mechanics of 'good design' I would say your instructor is right and that you'll end up in informative territory if you talk about what makes design functional. With the rise of data our design decisions are much less subjective than these used to be. Perhaps there is some debate to be had over whether designs should be functional for all at the cost of being pretty/'art' for others. ",1542818724.0

Average email hard bounces are said to be at about 15%. That's not insignificant. Also, many forms nowadays don't allow you copy/paste the first email field, so you couldn't copy your mistake.

>my advice is — avoid using email confirmation field. Instead, put your email field first, increase its size and font size for clearer reading and kindly remind a user to pay attention to what they write

While the double email box isn't a great solution, the alternative the author provides is probably worse. Where is the user testing or analytics to support that this solution is better and has less hard bounces?

* Separating date fields for a birthday may be clearer, but I believe we can have smarter auto-formatting here too, with helper text to push a spelled out month or a particular order for the numbers. This needs more thought. And for most other date-pickers, a (native) calendar is ideal. The only time I'd make a user select / manually enter a date is if a date would likely be years away (like birthday). There may even be smoother ways to handle this with a calendar I'm not thinking of. 

* Were we ever letting users validate a phone number field with random characters? I don't like to limit what can be entered, but if they moved away from a field like that, it would not pass regex. Pretty sure we're all using auto-formatting as described in the solution. 

* I believe it would be a mistake to gloss over a distinction between First and Last Name. It's not a small problem if a user can't be found in a DB. Sure, you can enter five names, but those will be saved as a single entry behind the scenes. This might be okay for something like a newsletter signup that doesn't need name validation (but if we're asking preferred name, we're making things unnecessarily more complicated). Many systems we design, however, require legal names and will lead to follow-up in the future. Again, context is important.

In my experience, the most important skill you will need is stakeholder management.  Navigating the politics and individuals that you will have to sell, pitch and work together to make your ideas come to fruition.  Make allies and friends to win over stakeholders.

When pitching your ideas, the art of storytelling will also be key. You will need to be able to sell the value of ux, by first selling your self as a skilled individual.   Only then you will get buy in from the ‘business’.  Some people get it and will value it, but there are some who will think you are just a graphic or web designer.

2) A company that cares about UX and welcomes the opportunity to insert design thinking in all the areas of their business. This may include areas where it may not be present and are open to new ideas. 

3) Colleagues that are interested in discussing design thinking topics that are not just about ""the page,"" ""the app,"" or the ""process.""  Colleagues from across the organization would be willing and interested in talking about design outside of the confines of the digital space, interaction design or information architecture.

mordekai47,"I would say that it does apply more to enterprise software than anything else. I've had this conversation a few times, and it seems that most people don't see the bigger picture until it is explained - Your enterprise software would affect your client or end user eventually, and it may have serious consequences.

For example, let's say you work for a bank, and your back end enterprise software is slow on every page load:

* It's going to slow down the person who works in the branch.
* Which will take more of the customer's time;
   * This might annoy the customer and make the bank seem incompetent.
* When the system is slow, you can't churn out as much customers.
   * Which means that either customers would have to come back tomorrow, or that staff needs to put in more hours of work;
      * This will lead to unhappy staff and customers,
      * Staff might resign due to over work,
      * This will cost the bank more money to pay for staff overtime.

All of the above could eventually cause customers to leave the bank. This is just a small example, and it could easily escalate to much worse. But I've seen it happen; and that's why I believe your enterprise software is more important.",1542609102.0

 [Interaction Design](https://www.interaction-design.org) -there’s a paid membership for this( was about 160 I think for the year) but the amount spent actually is extremely worth it! It provides videos as well as reading material to go over and tests your knowledge with multiple choice as well as open ended questions for you to answer. Courses take about 11 hours to complete on average and lessons are spread over numerous weeks. After you finish the course you get a certificate that you can add to linked in and is recognized by some known companies! 


[Daily Ui](http://www.dailyui.co) - If you’re looking for Ui project ideas and want to try doing interfaces on your own, it’s a good place to get ideas.

Hope this helps!",1542599235.0
abeysunn,"Hi. I'm pretty sure there's a better route than what I'm about to recommend, but like you, I too am a self-taught UX Designer, and to be honest, after 4 years of experience, I often find myself referring to these sources.

1. A good samaritan compiled UX Laws at [https://lawsofux.com](https://lawsofux.com/), presented in summary with links to articles for further reading. Not only will these give you clarity in making better design decisions but in instances when a stakeholder (probably a design lead, product manager, engineer, investor, or even the end user) challenges your decisions, you've got proven laws to back you up, though there are always fringe cases.
2. Familiarize yourself with design principles. There are properties like contrast, texture, balance and alignment, whitespace, repetition, and proportion, that are the basics of design education. Know it, practice it as much as you can.
3. Familiarize yourself with user psychology. Developing empathy by putting yourself in your user's shoes to feel their pain and delight is important. Joe Leech has written a book that's a short read and a good starting point into the subject. Download the free book from [https://mrjoe.uk/freebook](https://mrjoe.uk/freebook/). Besides Psychology, there are more disciplines to learn about in UX, but there's a good chance it may overwhelm you when you're starting off. Take them up a bit later.
4. Get a hold of a copy of Don Norman's Design of Everyday things. Read it.
5. Great UX and Visual design lessons at [https://hackdesign.org](https://hackdesign.org/). This was indeed helpful when I was starting off and got me through interview rounds.
6. At some point, when you assess yourself and feel you’ve graduated from being a novice or junior are ready to move up the ladder, watch/listen to the High Resolution podcast ([https://www.highresolution.design](https://www.highresolution.design/)). The two designers behind it have put together an excellent series where they’ve interviewed industry biggies and the insights they’ve shared are gems. Plus, they do talk about the challenges they faced on their journey to the top and you’ll realize their story isn’t too different from your own.
7. While I won't recommend [https://dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/) and [https://www.behance.net](https://www.behance.net/) as a reference of UX done right as I find most of the projects there impractical, the designers there do have a great sense of visual aesthetics. Where you're starting off, simply recreating their style and looking at their process can help you learn a lot. You'll find end users being tolerant of products that look good even if there are UX flaws, which you'll fix as you and the product grows.
8. Find a mentor at your workplace who is willing to guide you, and never work in isolation. My mentor and I would often discuss finds on ProductHunt and exchange notes and this kinda laid the foundation for healthy critiquing behaviour, where we'd put ourselves in the shoes of the creators of that product and dissect, or reverse engineer their decisions. Bounce your ideas off them (and your colleagues too) and do not worry if they are bad or good. Usually, it's not that an idea isn't good, it could simply be that it isn't relevant to the time and product strategy and could be revisited at another time.
9. Designers from established companies to emerging startups share their thoughts and opinions, workflows, tips and tricks on Medium and hold open discussions on Twitter (and sometimes on Reddit). Follow them, engage with them. Most of them are quite friendly. Designers such as Pablo Stanley and the guys behind The Future ([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-b3c7kxa5vU-bnmaROgvog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-b3c7kxa5vU-bnmaROgvog)) have gone out of their way to give back to the community.
10. Learn the tools of the trade. Start with Sketch (If you're in a Windows machine, use Adobe XD; it's free with limitations. I won't recommend Photoshop and Illustrator as though they can get the job done, using it for digital product design is similar to using a bulldozer to shape an ice statue). Sketch (And Adobe XD) is easy to use and there’s an ecosystem of plugins, prototyping and hand-off tools built around it. Get acquainted with rapid-prototyping tools like InVision, Marvelapp, and Principle (I’m suggesting these since you’re starting off, but feel free to explore hi-fidelity ones like FramerX and Origami). With these, you can quickly test your ideas with stakeholders and users. You're right about learning HTML+CSS but don't stress on it. There are tools like Webflow that let you create feature rich and beautiful sites without the need for a developer. Knowing HTML+CSS and mastering Webflow gave me an edge over my colleagues when it came to designing products for the web. Also, it trains you to think like a developer, but not by much since there's no programming involved. Keep a notebook and a pencil with you at all times. Also, learn a tool like AfterEffects and Keynote if you can.
11. This next bit about design sprints also depends on how your team currently works and their willingness to participate, but I've found it keeps processes tight and focused while product building. A design sprint helps you or your team to quickly understand which ideas are relevant to your product, decided, prototype and validate them before pushing to production. Here's [https://storage.googleapis.com/designsprintkit/media/3DayProductSprintDeck\_template.pdf](https://storage.googleapis.com/designsprintkit/media/3DayProductSprintDeck_template.pdf). This is more of a workflow recommendation and I'm sure there are more successful ones other there.
12. Coming from tech support, you've already been listening to your users problems and wins. Keep this practice going. Reach out to a sample from them at the start of a project to know their needs, during testing to understand if your solution is working for them, and at the end when you release it to the entire userbase to get their feedback. For users scattered across the world, we used Slack and created a private channel to interact with them. The people behind Molly ([https://molly.com/](https://molly.com/)) use Discord to do the same. Point is, your user's feedback is important. It also helps to use the devices they own. At one of the startups I worked at, designing for a developing country, tier 2-3 cities, where data bandwidth is low and the devices they own are something like a $40 Moto E, I found myself pulling my hair out waiting for simple things to load, but that's what was normal to a user from that region.

I keep a track of reading sources through Feedly, and discover new literature through [Refind.com](https://Refind.com), as also the stuff shared by designers, developers and product managers on Twitter.

Hope this helps :)",1542604434.0
ux_ish,"Is it the design side, or the research side?

If it's more design, I'd recommend practicing using whatever design tool(s) the company is using - Sketch, Axure, Figma. Make mockups to design features for apps you use that you wish they had, and test them on people you know to see if they can use them and enjoy it. Mockup your own apps. Share them online to see what people think. I've noticed communities on reddit where people share ideas and mockups they have for existing apps (like mobile games) they use and they get a lot of feedback. Iterate, and test again.

For the philosophy of UX, Design of Everyday Things is a good book.

If you're interested in research, practicing interview skills, writing surveys, planning and setting up AB tests, and MAYBE some basic statistics could be useful things to learn. I've seen people also use analytics in their research (e.g., what pages get the most traffic). Basically, strategizing how to get the best data that will give you an understanding of what your users need, where they are struggling with your product and how you can improve their experience (or, sometimes, get more time spent using your product)",1542558997.0

My personal recommendation is to start by reading a book to learn the fundamentals of design which will mainly be learning about cognitive science, psychology, and human-computer interaction, all which are topics that overlap. Design of Everyday Things would be a great start, if you haven't read it already. After that I'd take an online course that walks through the fundamentals of the user-centered design process.

Like I said this was before the UX boom, and quite frankly, this new age UX philosophy made me feel like I was left behind. I felt worthless because I didn't know what certain terms were. We didn't design 'empathy maps' or 'affinity diagrams' but we did go directly to the users, spoke extensively through calls and emails, created an advisory panel for feedback and everything. We KNEW our users. We understood them without all this jargon and methodologies.

I could be just old, but it seems its more about knowing what methodologies mean rather than properly engaging the user. Before, I was user focussed, building relationships with end users and adapting to the climate, talking to them personally. Now it feels I should be buzzword focused and attempt to run certain methodologies because the previous way I used to work would be considered old hat by comparison.

Notstrongbad,"I feel like a charlatan myself.

&#x200B;

I started my journey into UX from a completely unrelated field (logistics/operations management). I learned about UX from a client, and after researching it discovered it would put my many disparate skills/interests to use. I started down the self-learning path, read all the books, attended all the UX Meetups, took volunteer projects while (working full-time) to build a portfolio, then started applying after about 9 months of this. 

&#x200B;

I got hired as a junior Product Manager at an enterprise software company. They sent me to get a bunch of certifications (Pragmatic marketing PdM, Scrum PO, Agile, etc). I enjoyed it but continued to learn more about UX. I attended a 4 month UX Design course offered by a local college, taught by one of my design mentors. After working for a bit over a year there, I started applying to design roles. Would make it to final on-site, but there was always someone with more experience/education/etc.

&#x200B;

I finally get hired by someone I was recommended to by my mentor. I was brought in as a ""UX Designer/PO"", billing an obscene hourly rate (still not sure how I managed that...) doing UX/UI/PO work for a boutique consulting agency...and I have yet to do any *real* UX work.

&#x200B;

Yes, I do visual design, wireframes, prototypes for the client, make design/product recommendations based on usability research...but I haven't done a round of usability testing, or journey mapping, or A/B testing, or any of that. We always use externally validated research to inform and justify our designs (Baymard, NNG, etc). We don't test with users. 

&#x200B;

I feel like a fraud, like anybody could do my job because I'm not really bringing any real insights in terms of user research or related pursuits.

Unfortunately, that's exactly how this post comes off.

>I’m seeing an alarming amount of people from unrelated background trying to pivot into tech and trying to “break in” to UX because it's perceived as a low barrier way of getting a high-paying tech job.

Far from being a detriment to the industry, I see the multitude of backgrounds as an asset.  I've met great UXers who came from all walks of life - teachers, stay-at-home moms, architects, burger flippers, etc.  Their experience and insight from other industries brings a unique viewpoint that's absent in other areas of technology.

Especially in America, where the traditional post-secondary education system is prohibitively expensive and discriminatory in admittance, sometimes going an alternative route is the only option available for those seeking to better themselves.  The question shouldn't be ""Are these people ruining our industry?"" but rather ""How can we help those who want to get in be effective practitioners of the trade?""

I agree that the \*perceived\* lower barrier to entry is certainly a reason why these folks go for these types of jobs.  I'd argue that the barrier isn't lower, but simply feels more attainable from the outside looking in.

>... I’m helping with hiring for a new User Research Lead and it is really frustrating to get a pile of CVs of people who have applied for a role they are not even vaguely appropriate for.

Welcome to hiring!  This is a problem with almost every job posting.  Many job posting companies make their money on offering a system designed to root out unqualified candidates from even getting to your inbox.  This isn't unique to UX.  At all.

>Sifting through portfolios of shiny and pretty looking UI and pictures of people standing in front of doodles on a whiteboard is really getting annoying. 

This is part of what the requirement of having a portfolio has created, especially in an industry where a visual portfolio isn't necessarily useful.  You'll find similar complaints in other industries where portfolios are generally required as part of the job application process.

Whether or not portfolios are useful in hiring UXers is another discussion entirely.

>I honestly can’t think of another industry where a person can thumb through a few books, \*\*take a quick MooC or a quick unaccredited bootcamp\*\* and suddenly brand themselves with a job title despite not actually having worked in industry or have any relevant credentials or applied skillset. 

The unaccredited bootcamps - and the expectations they create in job seekers - are a big part of the problem.  Bootcamps can be excellent stepping-off points for those who want to get involved with the industry, but the problem is that they provide nothing in the way of trustworthy education or real-world experience.  They also generally fall short of being excellent education, only half covering topics and concepts.

That said, this happens a lot in the development world as well.  Just because your code can return ""Hello world!"" doesn't mean that you have the skills to be a junior developer.  That doesn't stop those folks from applying, and the rest of the tech world is rampant with the same problem.

>I just wanted to get a feel for if anyone else is worried about where UX as a field is headed.

I mean, didn't being a programmer/developer go through this before UX started jumping on the bootcamp bandwagon? It's very similar:  

* Person unsatisfied with their job hears, ""Learn how to code! You can get a high paying job!""  
* Person goes to a bootcamp/coding course online/watches a shitload of Udemy + buys a copy of Cracking the Coding Interview  
* Makes a Github account with their three projects every other person from the bootcamp has.  
* Applies for developer positions  
* Fails the tech screen when they can't answer questions about thinking through implementation or can't provide depth when interviewers ask about specifics.  

My tech lead says that it's the difference between being a coder vs. being a software engineer.

From my experience at looking at design portfolios, it's really easy to spot a GA UXDI graduate from a mile away - but I went to GA as well.  The difference is that I chose to focus on specific skills I wanted to develop, not just personas and user flows.  

The people who don't have a deep knowledge pool when it comes to UX, won't get hired at any place that has a true need for UX. And if a place does hire them, they probably would not be able to spot a true UX candidate anyway. ",1542223653.0

User testing and analytics has evolved into a UX specialization; it's not surprising given how much companies actively seek out those roles (how easy was it to get a job as a UX designer in 08 vs web designer when the ux title didn't really exist mainstream?). 

Right now it seems like companies want product designers without product designer wages attached to it, so it maybe easier to seek UX designers who do the same tasks but with a compartmentalized design process and without the executive decision responsibility?

>or a quick unaccredited bootcamp

I mean, my wife got a job in UX after taking a bootcamp, but I don't know if you'd call it ""quick."" It was 10 weeks long, and she was easily putting in 60+ hours a week. After class and on weekends, she was on the streets doing user interviews or at home making prototypes of varying fidelity. Now that I think of it, she might've been putting in closer to 70 or 80 hours a week.

700 hours of work is roughly equivalent to a graduate certificate. 

Afterwards, she got a job at a development firm who claims they do UX work, but they had no UX designer until my wife joined.

They seem confused about what a UX designer is, because they're treating her more like a graphic/UI designer. She keeps telling them that they need to go out and do user tests, but they're not interested. 

On a completely different note, I work at a small start-up and I tried convincing the CEO that we should hire a designer that has both graphic design and UX design experience, because we have a much older demographic, and it would be interesting to see how 75 year olds use our website, and how it could be improved. My idea was shot down, since he just wants someone to design graphics.

It seems like everyone else in the organization is expected to multi-task and wear 3 hats, but at no point does anybody put on the UX hat. 

So it seems to me that there's another side of your coin. Not only are some people claiming to be UX designers that aren't, but companies that are asking for UX designers don't know what they're asking for, or don't see the value in real UX work.

It ended up just being something they used to pull the wool over people’s eyes who aren’t involved in UX but perhaps serve on hiring committee. Sometimes it seems like they also just really want people to stroke their ego for something that they, frankly, have no skill or mind for. To be honest, many times they bring UX up as something they “do a bit of on the side,” as if it’s something that one can just dabble in. 

I’d be much more forgiving and accepting if they actually tried to develop the mentality, at least, required for effective UX work, but I rarely see that desire to learn. Understanding and designing for users means constantly learning, and that’s what I find that some of us miss over here on the university side of things.

Most of the portfolios look great (who knows how long they had to spend on projects without time constraints), but these only show concept work they had to design to complete their UX bootcamp course. These might trickle in a couple of design-ish work from previous jobs (btw, logo design is not UX) of half-truths of the nature and result of the work. I've seen they also listed misleading or plain incorrect titles in their work history. Yes, we have ways of verifying your claims.  Our hiring managers rarely see that these candidates did any UX work in the REAL WORLD, let alone seeing if the work impacted actual business results.  We need to hire people that worked across many real projects, not just one.  Time and working on many projects make any professional better at their craft.  I've run into candidates calling themselves gifted programmers but had only the most basic of basic skills. I'm surprised at such likes because they will be assessed during the hiring process to confirm abilities. Although there might be some gem candidates that went through UX bootcamps.

We get the jobs over seasoned people because we are willing to take a lower salary, but it's still a big step up in pay from our last jobs.

FlightyTwilighty,"It might be helpful if you break it down into two different types of journeys.  If you're talking about a pre-sales journey where the customer has not yet made a purchase, that is a very different type of journey from, say, an onboarding journey where the customer has made the purchase and you're trying to find out problems with your onboarding process.  With a pre-sales journey, you probably need to open it up a little bit and think about all of the different ways your prospective customer can get information from other sources (internet, colleagues, etc.).  Then there's a decision point where the customer actually makes a purchase decision - and obviously you'll want to zero in on the factors which make the customer jump in one direction or another.  So I'd urge you to think about WHY you are creating the journey map.  (And you will probably want more than one.)

I'd also urge you to make sure the journey map is research based, and ideally includes a qualitative component.  Qual doesn't have to be a huge effort - do a few user interviews (which could even be remote!) and there will always be interesting results which are much more valid than just making up your idea of what a journey map is.",1542122670.0

the_kun,"The map should outline all the touch points between business, customer, and system.  You may have more than one type of user for each. You also may have multiple journey phases that may include all those user types or some. 

Before you start you have to gather information on all the different types of people that are involved and their goals/actions/knowledge.

When creating a journey map, I like to think of A) what purpose I am trying to convey in my journey map, B) the audience of this journey map, then C) what relevant information will i need to serve A) to B).

This will feed into your map in terms of what categories of information you want to share for each lane of the journey. Common categories are 'pain points', opportunities, communication channels, touchpoints, relevant technology. It all depends on what message you are trying to convey.

it would be nigh impossible, since the stuff you want to measure is very contextual. people will endure (even ignore) a lot, if there's gain in it for them. but this app - as i understand it - would provide no such gain for the subjects, so the results would probably end up all over the place.

in other words, an interface doesn't exist of itself alone. it's in the eye of the beholder, so to say. and that eye changes under different circumstances. what's a passable pattern in one situation might be a big no-no in others, and vice versa.

As a digital marketer you work with the same types of websites/applications, you build empathy for the user (although likely not in any process-driven way) and as a bonus you have a skill that most UX designers don't have/neglect learning.

You'll find that using search console/keyword research and web analytics as an extra step during discovery really helps form better questions when you interview users. It saves time but mostly, maximizes the potential research you get from these activities.

It's entirely possible to make the switch and I would highly recommend studying UX to complement your existing skills, even if you're not practicing pure UX at first, you learn how to approach problems with a user-first, évidence based view.

Your analytical and data interpretation skills from marketing will help greatly in the synthesis of information. 

Being a marketer, you're expected to be good with people (and receptive to their needs) so you will be at an advantage when researching with the users and clients. 

Eventually as you broaden your skills with UI, it will become more important to study visual design fundamentals and get critique as you practice.

UX is a great starting point for becoming an effective problem solver and there are multiple rabbit holes to dig deeper into, once you gain some experience in practicing the methodology and find out what aligns with your strengths. ",1541897797.0

Pynchon101,"There are multiple roles that make up ""UX"" within an organization. One of my favourites is UER, or ""User Experience Research"". The best summary I can provide is that this role is dedicated to analyzing user behaviours to determine the best solutions to a problem, out of many possible options.  


This is, possibly, the most important part of UX. A lot of UX designers may start out with the intent to put their design skills, and possibly their academic understanding of HCI, into practice by producing a bunch of cool designs that they feel incorporate the best practices in their field. However, the real world isn't always so neat and tidy. Some users/customers might surprise you in their resistance to ""better"" interfaces. Other times you may find that some designs aren't as intuitive as you think. The more you dig into this, the more you realize that not all audiences are the same, and don't respond the same to what might be commonly considered cutting-edge, intuitive user experiences.  


Beyond this, a large portion of UX is about information architecture: how do you present data, and is it easy to understand? This is a field of practice that can encompass text, numerical data, and data visualization. While some aspects of this may require design skills, a lot of it has to do with how people consume data, and what kind of data is important for them to achieve their end goals.  


All of this is to say that whoever is preventing you from getting into UX because your ""drawing skills"" are sub-par is very narrowly focused on only one field of practice within the greater UX sphere. If drawing isn't something you care about, there are still many roles or options out there in this field.  


That said, if you think strong illustration skills are useful, consider these two points: 

a) Most UX design has more to do with the placement of boxes in wire frames -- if you use common products like Balsamiq, Lucid, Google Draw, Omnigraffle, etc., you can find many common templates that will do most of the work for you.

b) Practice will generally improve your motor skills and spatial sense. These are key factors in the ability to draw anything. Performing exercises that help with these skills, ad nauseam, will significantly improve your drawing skills. 

&#x200B;

Keep at it! If you're passionate about this, please don't give up. The best employee for any role is an employee who is passionate about their domain. You may not come out of school with the best skill set, but if you're more passionate about the field than any of your peers, you'll be leagues ahead of them in 10 years' time.",1541613863.0
TheAceOfHearts,"I'm an engineer with a bit of interest in design and UX.

Designing good UX doesn't require creating pretty mockups. In fact, you'll often want to avoid making it pretty so people will focus on the content and interactions and not nitpick about the design. I've previously used [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for simple mockups and wireframing, and if you look through the pictures you'll notice it doesn't look very pretty.

Drawing is a skill people can learn with practice. Art is our first language as children, and when we discover words, a lot of people put art down. You might not be amazing, but you can get better. That's true for anything with education and practice.

luxuryUX,"I've never been a big fan of prescribed step-by-step ""process"" before understanding the context of the problem, resources available, timeline, and constraints. If you're working in an agile way you should not have prescribed process steps.

&#x200B;

Each problem deserves proper investigation and application of the right methodology. I see a lot of junior people (not saying you are) try to plan out a project end to end with suggested steps but real-world projects are not mechanical nor do they deserve a check-box approach.

Plyphon,"My process is simply:

&#x200B;

1. Empathise (who are the users, what do they want to do? What is the value proposition for the users? What are their pains?)
2. Define (What is the Design Hypothesis? What are the user needs, wants, goals? What could we build?)
3. Design (What are the journeys/flows? Sketch, design (low/med/high fi)
4. Prototype (What do we want to learn? How do we know if we've succeed?)
5. Test (Do users understand the experience? Are there any pain points? Are they delighted? etc)
6. Repeat if required.

As long as you're following a similar **process** to the above the actual activities and deliverables you do, you just need to make a call as to what is right for the project at the time depending on how big/small the delivery is, budget, deadline, etc. As long as you broadly understand the things in the brackets you're doing a UX process.

&#x200B;

You'll never have the time to do a stakeholder interview with everything that comes across your desk if you're working in house, especially within an agile team. It depends what you're doing but for example, adding a simple feature to a digital product could be something you turn around in a week, whereas redesigning a whole webshop would be a much larger project that has many, many moving parts and stakeholders. You wouldn't pick the same activities/deliverables for both.",1541607181.0
beanbagbotatoes,"I think your process/steps are pretty close to my approach. Here is what I do (if it's a brand new project):

1) Define your business & UX goals and objectives
2) See what other competitors are doing, maybe try out their products (conduct usability testing on their stuff and see what the public thinks)
3) Empathize users and conduct user research (user interviews, surveys, ethnography, etc.)
4) Ideate and sketch out ideas based on your user research findings
5) Create a vision map (user journey on steroids -- overall vision of what your user will go through when they are interacting with your product -- a living document and will iterate overtime)
6) Create sitemap and do cardsorting (also a living doc)
7) Sketch and storyboard your ideas
8) Wireframe (start with LoFi) to convey your ideas to stakeholders, iterate many times
9) Prototype and usability testing, iterate many times
10) Add visual design elements and conduct usability testing, iterate many times
11) Handoff designs to developers
12) Work with developers for any issues during development.

Things can obviously change and steps can jump around depending on which stage the project is at. And this may not work for every company (i.e. companies don't have the resources or money for user research, etc.); there are definitely trade-offs, so you just have to be flexible and adapt to what their needs are, but still stay true to yourself and your approach.

literallyARockStar,I'd look for a UX designer to have reasonable comfort with suplexing at the mid-weight level. ,1541556039.0
TheCriticalSkeptic,"I might be a bit more harsh in my requirements for a UX-er than others. I expect if someone is a junior that they can actually do the job well and not simply play a support role. Because I've worked with plenty of juniors who can do the job with limited supervision I would never hire a junior who can't.

The below is for a UX Designer. For someone who does a research heavy role the design side of things is not required (but I would assume their research knowledge would be better than a similar level designer).

**A junior** should be able to do **all** of these:

* Basic generative research, e.g. interview users about their journey (including needs, behaviours, goals, and tasks)
* Do the stock-standard UX synthesis like journey maps and personas
* Create prototypes with at least some interactions (at a minimum Invision, but ideally in Axure, Proto.io or similar)
* Basic evaluative research, i.e. usability tests
* Basic expert reviews, including competitor/landscape analysis, with the ability to identify common usability pitfalls

**A mid-weight** should be able to do **most** of these:

* Understand business needs, including the ability to run stakeholder workshops and conduct some requirements gathering activities
* Be able to conduct a variety of generative research, e.g. CI, diary studies, observation sessions, qualitative surveys, etc.
* Have a better understanding of how to recruit users for research, how to engage research panels or techniques to recruit internal users
* Have some basic grasp of quantitative research (good questions to ask in a survey, know what to look for in web analytics data, look at research reports from quant research agencies)
* Start to understand the importance of task analysis (or the latest trend calling it ""jobs to be done"")
* Have a basic grasp on how to do research for Information Architecture (even if they may not always get an opportunity to do it)
* Be able to communicate their research findings in a variety of ways (e.g. realising when/if personas or journeys are even necessary)
* Create prototypes with more advanced interactions, covering a wider range of scenarios
* Conduct more detailed evaluative research, working out what needs to be tested and why (and understanding that 5-8 users generally involves some level of compromise in spite of what NNGroup say)

**A senior** should be able to do **a majority** of these:

* Be able to speak to the business about the importance of UX and convince business leaders to engage in research activities
* Be completely capable of doing at least part of the jobs of a Service Designer, Business Analyst & Project Manager (service blueprints, requirements gathering, technical feasibility, timeline management)
* Have a much better grasp of *which* generative research activities are useful for which end goals, and a better idea of ""experimental design"" so that their research yields desired outcome
* Have a much deeper understanding of quantitative research, including the ability to understand sample size, effective survey designs, how to work with quant agencies and data scientists, etc.
* Understand the compromises they have to make with different information architecture approaches (including the time/cost/benefit trade-offs of different research approaches)
* Be able to do a complete hierarchical task analysis (or JTBD if you prefer that wording)
* Be capable of designing complex prototypes - but more importantly: knowing when to do a simpler prototype and avoid building something complex if they can help it
* Not need to do as much synthesis on evaluative research to get a good outcome (but be fully prepared to do so when it's necessary). Instead they know how to iterate quickly
* Be able to explain their research findings to a wider audience, including bringing stakeholders on the journey of *why* certain approaches were used to reach these endpoints
* Be able to utilise junior/mid-weight designers/researchers to help them with projects
* Be able to work with a wider team, including working with developers in agile environments

At the senior stage they should have started to decay in some of these areas: interaction design, information architecture, research methods, prototyping tools. Why? There are too many skills here. e.g. I can't imagine someone being equally knowledgeable about the latest design patterns for mobile menus, experimental design methods, and information architecture approaches. It's *unlikely* that someone has deep knowledge in all UX areas.

**A lead** should be able to do **all** of these:

* Set up a UX team, including interview and recruit for UX skills that they don't have (e.g. be able to find a good designer for voice or AR interfaces even if they've never done it)
* Manage project budgets as well as timelines (research budgets, resource allocations)
* Mentor junior designers
* Have enough authority in their presence that senior designers will work with them, while having the humility to accept input from other designers on projects (even letting more senior designers take the lead when necessary)
* Have a thorough understanding of the research methodologies and prototyping tools available to them so that they are always choosing the best approach for the particular job
* Get more involved in the customer experience, service design, business, and technology sides of aproject (possibly more than they are involved in the UX side if they have a big enough team)
* Know how to manage external vendors (especially research agencies, contractors, and consultants)",1541567145.0

This isn't necessarily true, it's more about the situation at hand. For you, I'd say a broader, automated approach is best. If you did this face-to-face in a classic usability test, you'd get a lot of attitude/preference data. But, you may not get data on actual performance.

My company has A/B testing as a separate role so I don't do much of it, but they use Adobe Analytics. However, I know that they were just using google analytics. It honestly doesn't matter too much as long as you can segment A and B and then effectively track the events that determine your user's performance.

Response should not be to immediately design this feature/the best version of this feature - it should be to dig into the pain point that prompted this ask. WHY do they want this feauture - maybe it's that they want to be able to then upload that CSV into salesforce or something - a good solution to the real problem is often different than the solution customers and stakeholders ask for.

behy77,"I think I can give you some insight on this since I was exactly in your position. I took the path of sticking it out with Computer Science and studying UX/UI on the side in hopes of having a unique background when I got into the workforce. 

I found Computer Science very interesting but wasn't very good at it. I realized this early on and found myself trying less and less, and focusing more and more on UX/UI studies. The problem with this is that if you don't have a passion for CS, then you're only digging yourself a bigger hole as the years go on and the courses become harder and more complex. I barely got by, and after I got my degree I thought I was in the clear, but it really only got harder from there.

The roadblock I kept running into when looking for work was that companies would rather go with someone that actually studied UX as a major (or something close to it) and had a well-rounded portfolio. Don't get me wrong, they loved the idea of having a background in CS and understood the value in that (being able to connect design and development), I was even lucky in the sense that my small portfolio got me interviews and let me get far in interviews. But the norm became that they would go with the other candidate because of their experience with UX/UI either due to their education or due to their portfolio. They had years in school developing it with a breadth of projects backed by professionals teaching them in that field. 

I'm lucky now that I found work at a startup. I started out as a product design intern and due to some tasks that I took on, I am now a UX Engineer (basically code while having a hand in the design). It took me about 8 months to find work. I'm not very happy with the pay but thats my own fault, I don't have much leverage given my situation.

If I could go back, I would definitely focus on moving to a major that had more to do with UX studies. I think you have had some exposure to CS and if you want to be in a position where you can both code and design, then study that on the side. If UX/UI is your definite passion and career focus, then pour your resources into that.

Also remember, this was my experience with all of this. Your experience will be totally different, but I thought you might gain some insight into it. If you have any other questions you can go ahead and PM me. I hope this was somewhat helpful.

Best of luck!",1541465973.0
tranz,"25 year, now a VP of UX and Design that can also code. UX is 90% psyc and 10% execution. How do people think? What motivates them? Can you form empathy for the user etc. I've got a team of 11, a few on my team have CS degrees and they're the hardest to educated on UX. 

Does knowing some code help you to be able to convey an idea to a client and/or the dev team that can pull it off, sure. Is it needed NO. You pull in the head or lead of dev and work through it together.

Taking a bootcamp will give you the basics. But, when you hit the real world. Toss the ""this is the way a project should be."" mentality out of the window.

I would hire someone with a psyc degree all day long over someone with a masters in CS. Build a portfolio that shows the journey of your work, concept sketches, wireframes and then some of the completed work. Just showing the nice finished result doesn't tell me you know the steps on ""how"" to get there.

The biggest thing to learn.....""How to sell, yourself."" 

If you can't or are not comfortable getting in front of a group and/or someone and first selling yourself and thus instilling confidence in your design direction. It's going to be difficult and you'll be a worker bee. Learn to sell yourself first, then pitching your ideas to the client becomes easier. You learn how to guide the client to their end goal.

Also, as a UX'r. Remember, you don't work for the person paying the bill. You work for their users. You do them a disservice if you just listen to the exec, stakeholder etc. Without doing any user research to prove that what they think they know is correct. If you solely listen to them. 90% of the time they ""think"" they know the user, but they really don't. You'll design something, it gets deployed and doesn't get the adoption they expected. You'll get blamed. To avoid this. Always back up your designs with best practices and user research. Be the advocate for the user, not the pixel monkey for the exec.

stackinpointers,"What are your eventual ambitions? If you don't mind being a lifelong designer and/or pigeonholed into UX, you'll definitely want to switch out of CS immediately. But if you're thinking bigger, i'd recommend sticking out the CS degree. A  front-end engineer that's strong in UX/IA is a goldmine and will make you a hot commodity. Employers pay \~2x for that skillset versus just UX alone. And once you've got a bit of a track record, it's easy to pivot your career into something like UXE (UX engineer) that's more focused on UX but uses code to bring ideas to prototype form.

&#x200B;

As much of a slog as the CS degree is, the actual work is far less technical and much more UX-heavy for someone that's front-end focused. I'd recommend doing some tutorials and building an HTML5 app or an iOS app before you throw in the towel and study psychology. In fact, here's a bold take: you're better off dropping out of school and takin UX bootcamps than paying for a psych degree.",1541468275.0

oopiex,"I'm a UX designer with a computer science degree.
For me it was a bit different. I became a designer before I had a degree, and I wanted to continue my career path while also improving myself, and I saw a CS degree as the thing that will give me the most value.

I did well in the degree for two years, then I joined an entrepreneurship program and in my third year learned about businesses and startups.

I think it was a good call.

My takeaways from my experience:
- you don't need any degree to be a good UX designer
- if you insist on getting a degree, get something you care about, which will also benefit you in the long term

So if you don't care about CS at all, I suggest to stop pursuing a CS degree, and rethink a new question, 'should I get any degree at all?'",1541488459.0

leftoversnacks,"From what I understand, having a technical background shouldn't hurt you at all. In fact, trends for this career show that someone who can code and design are preferred in this market. Especially as tech gets more complex, it gets a bit more difficult to design for it in an intuitive way.

That said, here's my experience. Though I'm not yet working in the industry, I have a bachelors of Linguistics/Philosophy, finished a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp, but found that what I enjoyed most was designing and research (on top of the fact that I'm not a great coder). In pivoting toward UX/UI, I'm finding that understanding code is giving me a leg up because I now have tools at my disposal to help flesh out ideas from conception to code. And when you have a full project like that on a portfolio and can talk through it, it really makes you that much more valuable of a prospect.

unaccredited UX bootcamps have sprung up churning out people at an alarmingly high rate. Couple that with a more mature hiring market and you can see why so many people are left frustrated and disappointed after ""graduation"".

&#x200B;

If someone were to try and enter industry from ground zero with an unrelated educational background I'd suggest finding a mentor, go to meetups, read as many UX books you can get your hands on and take some MooCs to get a grasp on theory and to boost your CV with a legitimate credential.

If your bootcamp isn't focusing on what really makes face-to-face learning great: critiques and networking, find another one.  Firehose information blast as a sole source of knowledge transfer doesn't work.  You will always receive more information than you're able to comprehend in a good course - that's as it should be, but you want a solid project to be able to bring that knowledge into your practice, critique on how it went (retro), and to help build your community to leverage for this feedback and communication in the future.",1541271385.0

QuinZ33,"> it's literally impossible to learn Front End Development in 8 weeks. Just...no.

The one I took was 18 weeks (though it was full stack). 10 weeks of ""pre work"" which is about 20 hours a week, and then 8 weeks full-time, plus a lot of overtime. Something like 60 hours a week.

So that adds up to be nearly 700 hours of experience.

In a college course, you might do 10 hours a week for 15 weeks, or 150 hours.

So, the boot camp is about equivalent of 4-5 college classes worth of work. So maybe 2 semesters of a CS degree's worth of CS classes (provided that some of the other credits are general education stuff).  

The difference is it's narrowly tailored to a specific job title. Instead of learning a lot of theory or learning any kind of breadth, you learn a specific language and a specific framework. 

Now for UX, it's going to be quite a bit different, since it's less mechanical, and different companies are going to have different styles.

getjustin,"I recruit for a design/UX apprenticeship and pretty much roll my eyes at GA and courses like them. The students regurgitate in the moment trends like they’re decades old design philosophy. Their work is a mile wide and an inch deep.  And Thor help them if they decided to do some brand design or in depth UI. It’s typically awful. Plus they have a know it all quality to them that drives me nuts. Motherfucker I do this shit day on and day out and you don’t know WTF you’re taking about. 

You’d be better off reading about UX topics yourself, getting a copy of Sketch or Figma, and an InVision account and just hash out problems with what you’ve learned. ",1541076703.0
andreamw,"Honestly, if I were to go back and redo it, I would do a self-taught curriculum with a part-time mentor. 

Pay a mentor $100/hr for weekly lessons/reviews/etc (in person where their attention is solely on you).

Do that for 6 months and you'd have spent \~$2600 for weekly one-on-one attention. And have likely gone 50x further in your studies than in a classroom where you have to keep pace with the slowest learner.

This is what music students do, and it works really well for them. 90% of it is what you do on your own, 10% is getting that help, feedback, and advice, which is not actually what a bootcamp gives you. 

Other advice here is good (network, network, network; etc). Just my $0.02 that spending some money can be good, if you're spending it on what you need and not what you don't. ",1541088828.0
seriicis,"I went to General Assembly for UXDI a few years ago when the west coast cohorts were fairly young and the price was $10k. 

It’s really dependent on what you put in it and your process is more than it is theirs. It would be nice if they guided you through it more and helped you (since you’re paying so much), but ultimately it’s up to you on how well you succeed since they do provide you with those resources.

I do personally owe that program a lot. I got my first contract job out of their network and gained access to a lot of events and resources I wouldn’t have otherwise. 

Not gonna lie though, the moment I had enough experience, I deprioritized GA to a certificate program on my resume. 

",1541052118.0
bigbluewha1e,"I did the UXDI program with GA a few years ago. The tuition was less than 10k and the class size was about 50 people split into two cohorts of 25. I appreciated my experience there and do thank them for helping me transition careers by teaching me all the UX fundamentals. However, my friend who was in the same class as I was, but different cohort will not credit GA for her UX career. The program is heavily dependent on how good your instructors are and she had two bad instructors and I had the two good ones. I know this because whenever her instructors taught a group lesson, I would get nothing out of it because thats how bad they were. Any way, because of what I know, I definitely would not recommend GA for the price of 15K. I couldn't even recommend it to my friend who was considering it when the price was 12K.

&#x200B;

Here are a list of pros with alternatives so that you can save your money ;\]

Pro: You are placed in a setting where you are able to meet SO many upcoming UX professionals which will help you build your network in the industry.

Alternative: Network like crazy. Go to UX events and mingle with current professionals. Get to know how how their journey has been. Understand what their biggest challenges are and how their day to day is. Ask them how they grow within the industry. Any useful podcasts or blogs that you could learn from. You could even message random designers on Linkedin who you'd like to learn from and see where that goes - try and schedule some coffee dates so you can pick their brains :).

&#x200B;

Pro: You learn all the UX fundamentals in an academic setting which is great for individuals who need that discipline.

Alternative: Create your own schedule on when you'll block time to learn UX. There are plenty of affordable programs (or free) you can use to teach you the fundamentals such as Udacity.

&#x200B;

Pro: They help you create a portfolio of projects and people to work with.

Alternative: Most of the projects from GA are just random projects without a real client. The last project has a real client, but its a gamble what you get out of it. It was nice working with a real client , but my friend did not get ANYTHING out of it because the client ended up refusing to work with them due to them being students. So her and her team were left with nothing as the last project.  Any way, you can go through the whole design process and redesign an application you often use using the methods you learned and use that as portfolio pieces instead :)

It was nice being able to work with multiple designers for different view points, but i think you can always show your side projects to others to critique and work with them as well!

&#x200B;

Overall, I say leave the GA program and go back to self-learning. There are so many resources online. I would advise you to learn the UX fundamentals \[what is ux, what is the process, different research methods, etc\], how to use the different UX tools, and network like crazy. If you have the passion for UX, employers will see this.

90milo,"I'm actually quite glad that you're seeing issues with the GA bootcamp experience. It highlights to me that you're capable of critical thought if you're seeing issues with the overall process and curriculum. The reason why I say this is because I personally do not like any kind of bootcamp style education in this field, they are simply certificate factories producing sub-par UX zombies with little depth and knowledge about design. I often hear GA graduates at MeetUps speak possitively about their bootcamp experiences - good for them. But deep down I know that it will be a huge struggle for them to find those initial employment opportunities.

I know that a lot of hiring managers don't even consider GA or any of the other bootcamp style classes to be signs of a quality education. And, $15k?! That's more than half of my 4 year undergraduate design degree!

If you're paid up you might as well finish the course though, the networking side is also important. Go to lots of MeetUps and networking events. Get coffees. Do all of that extra-curricular stuff and I am sure you will be fine.

I've done the part time UX GA 2 years ago, and it's sooo basic that you can learn by reading medium articles. However, not all GAis like that. It always depends on the instructor. My instructor was not really really into UX Design, when her role was mostly project manager.. So that's why the curriculum in my part-time was vague and lacking with examples.

I do agree that there is not individual attention (except maybe office hours, but it isn't much time either way).

tokisushi,"I wish I could find this case study. I thought Mail Chimp put it out but I can’t seem to find it at the moment. 

A couple of years ago there was a case study about how having multiple 3rd party login sources caused an issue because people couldn’t remember how they signed up (did they make an account specifically for this service? Did they use google? Facebook??). So account recovery became harder AND if you accidentally used the wrong method, you had multiple accounts. 

There are also some new things to consider : like when the Facebook leak happened a couple weeks ago, it also gave people access to every account they used Facebook to sign in with. I haven’t seen any resulting studies about hesitancy to use 3rd party auth, but it is something to consider depending on WHY someone is logging in and the sensitivity of the service/information you are accessing. 

Then you can think about why you need to log in in the first place. What is the value of your service to the user? The sensitivity? What is the heart of the issue you are trying to solve? Jared Spool has an amazing talk on this general theme called “Is Design Metrically Opposed?” I really recommend checking it out. He talks about uncovering and approaching problems that may seem like “A” on the surface, but is actually “W”. With issues like login conversion, there is absolutely a lot to unpack there beyond 3rd party auth. 

I would also suggest exploring if login is even necessary. How much value can this offer before NEEDING a login? And what value does a user get out of making an account? If you need a way to capture leads, is an account the way to do it? Maybe yes, maybe no. There is a ton of clever services out there that explore breaking down traditional account barriers.

Finally: implementation! I have seen relatively streamlined 3rd party auth and annoying as hell 3rd party auth. I don’t recall all the rules and considerations for it as it has been years since I have touched it, but make sure you are getting all the information you need and don’t have to make 3rd party auth a process, or you really start to lose the value. For example : I have used systems that say “login with google”, but I still have to choose a user name and password and provide a ton of additional information. Not at all helpful!",1540817005.0

To the few that are in the same boat as me in the thread, I would post the advice I received but I'm afraid it's relative to the layout and content of my resume specifically so it wouldn't make sense if I copied and pasted everything verbatim. As I get more insight from people that haven't responded yet I'll try to generalize what's been suggested to me if I can.

Generalized Advice:

* Possibly write a short description of the bootcamp you completed to let the people hiring know what was covered, topics learned, etc. I have it listed, but all I include is the name and the date completed.
* Craft objective to explain that you're looking to get a UX role and why your background makes you a good candidate.
* Small descriptions for experience as opposed to full paragraphs. I.E. bullet points or small statements.
* Be aware of hierarchy of information. Important info at the top. In my case I had other software listed before UX software such as Sketch and Figma.",1540766598.0

thatseika,"It's pretty complicated when you're starting out, most hiring managers will have different ideas of what they're looking for from a UX/UI designer. Some will be looking for a lot of UI expertise with some basic research and prototyping skills, while others could be looking for someone with a much more comprehensive UX skillset but not much UI.   


The type of team you're looking to join also effects what the role could be - a product business could be looking for someone who understand lean/agile ways of working and is comfortable working with a product owner, where as an agency may be looking for someone who is comfortable working to a brief and delivering something within a set period of time.

I initiate this kind of spec assignment in my division. Basically all I asked to do is create a simple mockup of an app checkout process based on previous research insight. I always implied that the mockup should be simple, but your reasoning should not. 

UX, in my humble opinion, is about 1. mindset and 2. compromises. The most important question I asked is why you create the mockup like this, and what i love about this assignment is it opens up a spectrum of insight that i can't get from just asking regular interview question. How you actually understand what HCI is, and basic principle of UX. Or how to extract data and gain insight from the same research I get. 

I honestly think it should be fairer on the employee side to actually employed based on your logic and reasoning, rather than letting us (employer) guess based on how you present yourself, with an unreliable storytelling from employee side. And, I always get a better communication this way.

I moved to Canada and applied for about 50+ UX/UI jobs got 1 in office interview and a few phone interviews (I dispise phone interviews, they're typically ridiculous or unrelated questions to the job role, but thats a conversation for another day). 

I applied for one that asked for a UX project like you are saying. They give you a scenario project and was told it should take 6-8 hours. I spent 17 at it over a week I felt this was my only method to bag a job in this field (my interviewer after said that this is a general guide they expect people who are serious to spend more than 6-8 hours so keep that in mind). I got to show off what I'm capable of rather than my ability to talk bull. I was asked in for my first interview which was with the design director where I was asked to present and critique my own project followed by general interview questions a second interview followed a few weeks later which was a bit more of your general interview.

Through this method I was able to prove myself and bag myself a dream job in a international design company where I work with companies such as Apple, Microsoft, EA sport the list goes on. What Im getting at is use that opportunity to prove yourself rather than turn your nose at it.

One thing that helped with my first was sneaking in some moments that gave them pause. My org has such an aversion to engaging the customer, so I interviewed my team to learn how they represent the customer. Then, I interviewed customers on my own in our user labs and presented the results. The whole team first rejected the fact that they were wrong in nearly every assumption but I let it marinade and before long we were designing based on my interviews. Then I started sneaking them into demos and more feedback came. At first it was a fight and then they learned what it actually means to iterate.

yulingc,"Hi there, as the other say, I also think it's about the culture. Yet, my best advise would be to use a sort of ""objective referee"" to approach the subject and use facts as arguments to try out new ideas. Have you heard about lean methods ? The idea is to identify waste in your production workflow and test out ideas to try remove them.

It's tempting to try to import process that you saw working in another company to another, but that's not how it works -believe me, I tried importing processes from the French branch to the UK branch of my company and it didn't work, because people did not see what it would bring them versus the effort of learning to a new way to do.

Start with the problem and the pain points of everyone, start with the ""why"" (why they should try new ideas ?). That way you will engage them more easily. And start with small steps, they may lead you to the process you learned at Amazon, but they might also lead you to a new process because the company, the context, the people are slightly different.

For instance, I am a dev and I work with a UX designer on my project. We had some edge cases not covered on the mockup, so I had to call the UX to ask them what I should do in some case. Then I tried to make a checklist of edge cases that would need to be covered in a mockup. The UX told me it would take too much time for them to cover it, and maybe less for me to just ask me when I develop the feature. But then what he did not realise what that he was also interrupted every time I had a question, and sometimes he would have to think of a solution quickly whereas did he have more time he would have come up with a better solution. Seeing things from that angle, the problems that we were trying to solve with this checklist, he agreed to start using it when making a mockup.

I say inconsistently because I'd tend to regard it a failure state when less than a 3rd of users who we manage to convert are then taking any further action. 

The point of onboarding is both to introduce core ideas necessary as a foundation of being ready to go with a tool, and bringing the user to the A-ha! moment of realizing whatever big benefit your platform offers them. 

The core ideas are to empower them to use it or learn more about it so as to use it better.

The A-ha moment is what will keep them around and actually get them to use it (assuming a lack of other obstacles, for instance potential benefit isn't valuable if the product doesn't actually work, or if it's priced too high) 

You say that you've done some user testing and/or interviews on this. Can you convince your lead to join in on some more of that? Hearing problems directly from the user can go a long way toward actually accepting that there are problems.

&#x200B;

If you are creating a portfolio with the intention of showcasing it to employers or sharing findings with a team, creating a personal website with case studies is the best thing to do. One of the things I find to be the biggest  differentiator in being able to easily get interviews and roles you want, is the ability to market yourself effectively.

&#x200B;

Employers want to know (not necessarily in this order):

A) You know your shit

B) You won't fuck anything up and will also make them look good

C) You'll do a great job and will have fun/get along with the team

&#x200B;

I'd advise creating a personal website with in-depth case studies to showcase, links to social media (LinkedIn, Twitter), a CV page, as well as a section that says a bit about who you are as a person. At the end of the day people want to know you can get the job done but also want to work with someone who will be a good culture fit.

&#x200B;

I kind of used this awesome person site from [Simon Pan](http://simonpan.com/) as an inspiration/template for curating content on my personal site and was able to get interviews at Shopify, Uber Advance Technologies Group, Fjord, some F500s, and Government Branches.

FunnyBunny1313,"Hey!
I have been working in UX for the past 5-ish years, and come from a design background. Here is my two cents. Also, feel free to DM me if you want to talk in depth about anything. 

There are lots of tools you can learn, but frankly they all work pretty much the same (XD and sketch are all but the same product). Sketch is cheaper and more standard across UX fields, so I would start there. 

As far as UX being easier/faster for the job force...I would totally disagree. Usually you see (in high-functioning UX companies) between 4-10 devs per UX designer/researcher. Most companies have less. And on top of that, most companies just want someone who will just put the lipstick on the pig and not really vouch for users, so half your job might end up being a UX evangelist. So if you want a job *now*, do front-end. You will still have a lot of influence in design if you are in an agile environment, and if you are in a good company you can start working your way toward design. 

Another option is being a prototyper. There is usually a high demand for them, and that is like the half-way point between designing and coding. 

However, I totally get the not wanting to code thing. It’s not really something I prefer either. But what you need to know is that UX is not a hard skill like a lot of coding is, it is very much so a highly developed soft skill. Reading will help a lot, but honestly the best way to learn is through experience, especially with researchers. UX design is just one half of the UX coin, the other half is research and there is a lot of overlap. 

There are some things that school like this is good for, and not just developing a visual eye. Things that I have noticed from people who *didn’t* come from design are lack of good design thinking and being personally attached to their work. Design thinking is critical to UX. I personally think that in a project it’s about 1/2 of what I do, either by myself or with other people. IDEO has some pretty good classes on it I have heard. 

As far as portfolio goes, work on redesigning products you hate, or even better, ones you love. I often challenge new designers to try redesigning Spotify and how it would function. On the surface it seems really great, but there are some glaring usability issues. This is a great way to challenge yourself and fill out a portfolio, however there is one caveat...

All UX jobs require experience and/or a bachelors in design or related field, at least from what I have seen from job listings. Topically it’s some like “4-year degree in a relevant field or equivalent experience.” The good news is that a strong portfolio can get you far, and 4-year degrees are more like a check mark and not always super required since this is a super young field. I do not know what it is like trying to get a job with the various UX certificates floating around. But, as usual, experience + portfolio is going to be king here. 

Oh lastly, any company that is looking for someone to “do the UX” and lists some kind of coding as a skill requirement, that job is really for a glorified front-end and the company is just trying to placate some higher-up who heard that they should be doing UX. So just be careful how you market yourself once you start hunting for UX jobs. 

Hopefully this helps!! And I hope it’s not too negative. I just see some many folks/companies out there who think UX design is just knowing how to use sketch, so I have had to do a LOT of evangelizing lately!

biocomputation,"I wanted to come in and say that I'm not super optimistic given what you've written. In previous threads, I've said that my company, along with other companies in the industry, are doing ""no hire"" for people from UX bootcamps. There are a lot of reasons why, but it largely has to do with people seeing UX as a ticket to a high paying job.

I'm sorry to say this, but I don't think you have much of a chance being successful at UX because I'm not at all sure about your motivations. For example, you write:

>> I mostly signed up for this program so I could get a real salary job and get out of the service industry, but I am worried now that with my programming skills I may not be able to get a good job right out of the gate.

So you went into programming because of the money. People like you are why we are ""no hire"" for programmers from bootcamps. I can't waste time interviewing people who have no actual interest in programming beyond the compensation. You're going into UX because you have a passion for 'balance and enthusiasm and usability'? No, it sounds like you're going into UX for a paycheck. Countless people care about design and usability, but that doesn't mean that they'll be good at UX.

>>  I will also have a programming background

No, you won't have a programming background. Not if you're mediocre at Javascript. I'm sorry, but I am a professional programmer (who works with out UX team daily) and this kind of remark stretches your credibility past its breaking point. When you say this, what you really mean is ""I will also have a background as a mediocre Javascript programmer"". This will be utterly worthless in a UX position. What, you know how to write some JS? A little knowledge is dangerous.

>> I feel I will be in a good position because UX professionals in my city are few and far in between

But you aren't even the littlest bit aware of the availability of substitutes are you? There are UX professionals in every organization, even if they're not formally titled positions. You know who lead the UX charge at our org? The sales people. They pushed for better usability and ultimately pushed us to establish and hire for a dedicated position.

>> I studied a little bit of psychology in college too.

How in the world does this qualify you for UX? I have seen far too many people like you who try to position themselves as employable based on a few class room experiences and books and knowing how to use software packages.

Here's a likely UX scenario.

You get a report from customer success about some sticking points. They tell you to go get a data dump from ops about application usage. Okay, get the data into Excel somehow and run some statistical analysis. No BS either, because if I am the programmer, I am going to insist on hard data and I am going to insist that you verify every single one of your inferences.

I think you need to be much more realistic about what it takes to get into industry. Thanks to bootcamps, many markets are saturated with juniors. The world doesn't need any more people with a mediocre background in Javascript deciding to go into UX.

If you want to succeed in UX, you really need to READ EVERY SINGLE WORD OF WHAT YOU JUST POSTED and get extremely serious about acquiring REAL qualifications. You need to start being extraordinarily objective about your skills and qualifications, and whether or not you really have what it takes.

>>  I just want to make sure I am ready for my first interview with a decent sized portfolio. I am looking into learning Sketch, InDesign, Illustrator and possibly Figma and Webflow

See, you say things like this as if you can just magically acquire the skills to work in UX. It's just not that simple, and you really need to start taking this seriously if you want to get anywhere. It's not just going to be ""learn some programs"" and ""get a background in UX"".

ProspectPete,"First thing you need to know. It's never too late. Ever. Ever. You're already taking the first steps just by posting this. A growth mindset is going to be crucial to take you on this journey.

This is my own personal opinion but a bachelors or masters doesn't really mean jack in his field. This field is all about what you don't know. Data, testing, interviews, blind luck, whatever all direct and inform your process and solutions. What is really important and sets  you apart is your application of data, methology, etc. 

Best way to start? I say this a lot but I'd honestly take a weekend or evening workshop somewhere. Get your hands dirty a bit and learn the first steps of UX and see what part(s) really excite you. What did you love doing and you're ready to do again as soon you leave? Your background says UX research but maybe you want to be a generalist or focus on interaction. That's for you to find and define.

Start connecting designers in your area. Get to know them and understand what they do. Go to meetups and ask questions and demonstrate your enthusiasm. Find like minded people like yourself and start creating. Go to a hackathon and be the (probably only) UX person and make some cool shit. 

Finally read. Read everything and never stop learning. Shoot me a DM and I'll send you some pdfs to get you started if you want. 

Your background is not irrelevant. Your background provides you a unique perspective to continually evolving problem solving process. Leverage it. Lean into it. Use it to your advantage while you learn the basics. ",1540244525.0

irafcummings,"As other posters have commented, you have time to sort things out. As you're getting into the field, you may have to take a bit of a step back (you'll be walking in as a junior designer, despite any years of other experience), but passion and drive goes such a long way as you're getting started. No field is irrelevant, so what you need to next is three things:

1. Figure out what your transferable skills are. Psychology plays a **huge** part in UX, as does a business mind. Just make a list of things that will be the basis of what you'll use to get to point #2. Figure out how to talk about these skills in the context of UX.
2. Talk to people that are doing what you do. Hit them up on twitter, facebook, dribbble, or whatever they post. Buy them coffee and pick their brains. Find out how they got to where they are and if they have tips.
3. Get some relevant experience. Find a problem that you think you can tackle and create some outcome for. I want to stress that this **should not** be a redesign of Reddit or airbnb or [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com). Sure, you can show some UI chops, but that's not a problem that you can affect. Contribute to an opensource project, redesign your local town's website, or some other thing that's a real problem. Follow a good design process and document as you go. Test it with real people (users). Write about the experience. Boom: you have a case study.

It's not easy, but you can get there. Repeat steps 1-3 as necessary and you'll get where you need to be.",1540252494.0

queondaguero,"Every designer's path into a career in UX design is different. I moved into the field from a business background (communications/marketing) and did the following:

* Start educating yourself in the field and understand the design process, methods and exercises used by designers. I did this by following a free online design course (Springboard User Experience Design), reading books (About Face, The Design of Everyday Things, Don't Make Me Think, Design Sprint), following blogs on Medium (UX Planet, UX Collective).
* Apply what you learn to you own design projects. Find an app you use, interview some users and try to identify issues with the current design that could be changed. Find a new problem to solve and try to create a solution through different steps in the design process. Do whatever you can to put the things you learn into practice, you'll learn a lot from that. 
* Share your designs with others via blog posts, here on Reddit or with other designers to get feedback and critique on the work you've done.
* Go to meetups and events in your area for UX designers. Find people in your Linkedin network that are designers, reach out to them, offer them a coffee for an hour of their time and try to understand what they do and how they do it. 

This is what I did and I managed to land my first UX design job after 2 years. Every path is different, you've got to create your own. ",1540291554.0

3. Evaluate the interface elements. Do the elements on-screen follow conventional website standards? Are the objects you’re seeing indicate to the user that they can be interacted with?

4. Evaluate the information design. What colours and size of the text are being used? Is there enough contrast to make it readable? Does the position of the text make sense? 

5. Graphical element evaluation. Is the logo symbolic or accurately represent the tone of the company? Do the colours and shapes help the user find the information faster? Is it visually consistent or appealing?

6. Evaluate the copy (the words written). Does it communicate what you want users to understand? Are there ways of condensing the message, keeping it consistent with the brand or making it fun/clever?

Depending on who you get to interview you, they may look at your lack of gaming experience as a bad thing or with indifference of where you got the experience (as long as you have a passion for gaming). Luckily, I got the latter when I interviewed. Here are the differences I saw from web/app UI to game UI.

I would say the main difference UX-wise is how freeform everything is compared to the web; there are a lot more ways to successfully pull off a game design idea than their are on websites. Stick to your gut on what feels good and what doesn't (and if the company is big enough, leverage research). They will ask you questions about what games you're playing, what you like about different interfaces, what you don't like and what you would change.

For UI, there are two huge differences: the artistry on UI assets include a ton more layers and almost always will be done in Photoshop (no sketch); this should hold through for most games except maybe styles like the Endless series. The second is that, if you are the one cutting up assets there are a bunch of differences in how you'll create and handoff those assets, but as long as you're eager to use it won't be a problem.

Seeing the other response I should mention that my team had game designers, so I didn't have to worry too much about core game mechanics and win criteria, just interface design and streamlining some of the ideas the game designers created.

I guess it depends on what your dev team is set up like but I'd say in most product setups nowadays UX/UI designers do little to no front end work. I work in small team, 5-6 designers for a company of about 250-300 people and we're constantly swamped with normal UX duties alone, throwing front end work on top of that would be untenable. ",1539983164.0
FunnyBunny1313,"I think the question is not is it normal, but is that what the role should be. No, UX is not the same as front-end, and no true “unicorn” (someone who can do both research, design, and front-end) exists. Those jobs require specialization, and while it’s not bad to have knowledge of the specialties, they are not the same job role. However, a lot of companies basically have a  “UX/UI designer” that is basically a front-end. If you like the job, then stick with it. However, in my experience, the companies that lump all those roles into one person don’t really value what UX brings to the table, and more likely than not your actual designing time will go down significantly.

oddible,"In smaller companies designers wear lots of hats, just like POs wear lots of hats, and marketing coordinators wear lots of hats.  So is it typically normal in the domain of UI/UX? No.  Is it common for UX designers to do PO work, front end dev, market research, trade show booth design, print ads, and be the scrum master for the team? In small companies absolutely, especially those that are shrinking and compressing roles.  One aspect of UX is that we have a LOT of capabilities, so we can cover a lot of responsibilities.",1540008572.0

SeptixG,"Hey there got a few internship interviews recently and hopefully this can help somehow even though I have yet to hear from some of them. Companies include local consulting companies to a large multi-national firm so the experience varies throughout. 

1. Search through Glassdoor and see what that company's interviews are like. This is self explanatory but yeah..

2. They will probably ask about your typical design process. ""Walk me through your design process, from concept to a presentable product"" This is where you talk about if you start lo-fi and move up while interviewing your users and testing etc...

3. Have you worked in an agile/scrum team? This is seriously massive, some companies structure their entire business around agile and scrum so it helps to know what these things are. What is a typical sprint like etc. This might work out differently if you never worked professionally though. 

4. Tell me a time that you... typical, simple personality tests. 

5. Your portfolio got you the interview so congrats! You passed the visual/ design part. Through the interview I would personally dig deep into how you SOLVE PROBLEMS. From personal experience I had, lots of companies, especially higher-tier ones REALLY value psychology and problem solving over pretty design/ visuals. So This is what I mean with put emphasis on your problem solving skills when it comes to design.

You got this and we're rooting for you! Good luck!",1539978676.0

* The design team. Find out if there are any seniors.
* Who manages the team.
* If that's their first UX Internship.
* What will you achieve at the end of the internship.
* How does the learning schedule looks like.

**You'll be asked about (so prepare):**

* Yourself (create a intro presentation - I did mine on google slides)
* How will you solve a particular problem. (design exercise for them to see how you think)
* Your goals related to the internship.
* Your plans after the internship.

Amazing food scene. Seriously. Several James Beard chefs and many amazing up and comers. Also breweries, distilleries, and nice bars literally everywhere. There are beautifully maintained parks in the cities and in the surrounding suburbs. Very dog friendly and some of the highest rated schools in the country. The cost of living to wage ratio makes this one of the most affordable cities to live in. Basically any working professional who wants a house can probably afford one, but our housing market just EXPLODED this year so the prices are going up. 

There are several local design groups, too, so it is really easy to connect with the local community. We just had a free Jared Spool event in the cities where he gave a brand new talk.

The twin cities metro is anything but boring! It’s a beautiful area with a ton to offer. You can either live in one of the urban neighborhoods/downtown or if you’d rather live in a quiet suburb, you can easily get into the cities in ~15mins, depending on where you are. 

Winter kind of sucks, but there is a surprising amount of activities including: winter farmers markets, restaurant pop-ups, the art shanty festival on a frozen lake, winter parades, winter beer dabbler, winter scavenger hunt, etc etc. 

Some of our top employers : Target, Best Buy, General Mills, Medtronic, Health Partners, Optum, Amazon. There are also a ton of agencies from larger scale to tiny specialty shops. 

For perspective:

We commute about 10 minutes to work from a suburb. When I commuted downtown a few years ago from the same suburb it took about 35mins with morning traffic (its only about 25mins without). There are a ton of houses below or around $300k. Unless you want lakefront property, that was a really decent bracket to buy property in, at least 2-3 years ago.

owlpellet,"> Are these boot camps actually helpful and worth the time/money? 

Former bootcamp instructor here. It's real, but some major caveats:

- Standards vary quite a lot. Not every school is good. 
- Talk to graduates not employed by the school, no one else, about the student experience. Ask em where (if) they're working now. LinkedIn should have CVs of recent grads. Less recent grads probably do not keep the bootcamp on their LinkedIn.
- Bootcamps are intensely social activities. You cannot hide there. They can feel competitive, though I wish they weren't.  
- It's the start (or middle) of a several year ramp up. You're going to get barely enough to be employable. To succeed, you'll have to work the job plus ramp up on your own. 
- Some cities have several camps cranking out people with nearly identical skillsets and a finite number of organizations that can onboard people from a bootcamp. If you plan to work (or are willing to move) somewhere that is talent poor, you have a much better time of things. Think Birmingham, AL etc, where you are unique to recruiters. 
- If you think this is an easy money path, it ain't. You can go be a financial planner or something. 
- After three years in industry doing UX work you are pretty much minted. You'll have the skills to interview anywhere, and there's plenty of work to do. No one will care too much about your background. 

Is an option? Sure. Is this the BEST thing you can do with your time and money and energy? Depends. ",1539825738.0

I took a job as a marketing manager for a company that sent me to an e-commerce convention, and as I was looking to sit down and check my email, found myself in a UX keynote and that was completely it. I dropped everything that week and only attended UX talks. I was totally hooked. I dove into it full force after that, designed two sites for my company that both won awards, and moved to a new city with a lot more UX opportunity.

That all started only three years ago, and now I've worked my way up the ladder to a UX Strategist role omnichannel, for a major retailer. I don't know where I'd be if I wouldn't have found UX, or it wouldn't have found me. It's so thrilling to find it and know it's the right thing.

It sounds like research is a good route for you, but if you're looking at UX design, I would encourage you to take some design classes while you can.

Don't carry regrets for the path you've taken so far.  If anything, it's experience that you can put towards the future you'd like to have.

I'm in a similar boat as you, only somewhat in reverse.  I graduated with a degree in computer engineering mostly because it seemed like a stable career, and I had some interest in programming.  Now I have a stable job, but it's not quite fulfilling.

CJP_UX,"Edit: I'll lead with this [Are Women Paid Less than Men in UX?](https://measuringu.com/ux-gender/)

I generally see UXR salaries as higher than UXD. But I have seen a lot of women-driven UXR teams.

You have some interesting questions that academics have done extensive research on (ie: women in stem). I think engineer salaries are higher than UX salaries, regardless of gender within that to role (women devs make more than men UXers). This could be part of a broader trend of more male-dominated salaries being valued disproportionately in Western culture, but I think UX is less in demand and easier to acquire in skill than a dev job.

Did you see MeasuringU's 2018 survey?: [https://measuringu.com/salary-survey2018/](https://measuringu.com/salary-survey2018/)

>This year there are no significant effects of gender on pay. Women make slightly more than men in 5 of 7 experience brackets and men make slightly more than women in 2 of 7 experience brackets (3-4 years and 21+ years of experience). I will examine gender differences in a future article.

Somewhat of a change their 2016 version: [https://measuringu.com/salary-survey2016/](https://measuringu.com/salary-survey2016/)

>Somewhat similar to 2014 and 2011, there is an interaction between gender and years of experience. Women are paid slightly more than men when they have fewer years of experience (15 years or less). For more than 15 years of experience, men tend to have a higher salary. This interaction effect however was not significant in the model–meaning other variables explain differences in gender and experience. The age cohorts that had a statistical impact on salaries were Generation Xers between the ages of 36-45, which tended to have a slightly positive effect on predicted salaries (around $2k) and those older than 65 had a sizable $20k impact on salaries (although there were very few in the sample).

Unfortunately, MeasuringU salaries don't break it down by job role.

ed_menac,"The answer is that it depends so much on other factors. Namely:

* Size of the company / quantity of UX/UI work

* The skillset of the team, or supporting roles

Ask ""am I doing more than one person's worth of work"" - if so, you're undervaluing yourself. You either need to demand your projects are limited, demand higher pay or overtime, or demand more hires within your team.

Secondly ask ""is the quality of my output suffering due to lack of time"" - if so then you are undervaluing the industry and undervaluing your company by allowing it to continue. 

However its possible that neither of these apply. Hopefully your workload is such that you can produce quality work in an environment where you are comfortably busy and creatively supported.

If this is the case then it absolutely doesn't matter if you are doing both UI and UX work both. There's not an inherent need for separation of the two, and not all companies will need the specialisation, or have enough work to justify separate hires.

So long as there's a market for designers, there will be a market for both specialists and generalists. However companies who think a generalist can do the same work as two specialists is sorely mistaken, and if you get that 'vibe' then I'd walk away from an offer.",1539284928.0
livingstories,"I consider myself a product designer: UX, content/infoArch, an understanding of business outcomes impacted by UX, and expertise in user investigation and usability testing... I guess I don't see the purpose of separating out those roles because I have almost always handled at least some of that in nearly every job I've had so far.

However, I think in an ideal team you have UX and visual design working together, It is hard to do the UX heavy-lifting and have to be the master of pixel-perfection too. And I think my visual designer friends struggle with UX.

I also think that in-depth research on a quantitative level should be handled by dedicated UX researchers. So that makes a hypothetical team of three: UX, Vis design, Researcher.

Rockster160,"If I'm paying somebody to build the architecture of my house and design it, I assume those things do not happen at the same time. Even if planning the latter goes into the reasoning of the former, even that takes time AWAY from doing one or the other. You're not actually giving 3x value. You're just 1 person doing multiple jobs *at different times.*

It comes down to this: Would you prefer 100 people all working to get the job done quickly and having to pay them all at once, or 1 person to do the job- delaying the completion, but also drawing out the same pay over a longer period of time?

If you don't have good intuitive understanding of design you can't do ux well because you'll produce garbage based on what I have seen. Thats why basically every large tech focused company combines the roles now. Research should be its own separately focused thing but its a real focus that needs stats/analytics/qualatative/data skillset as well. 

""Now that I've added web development to the skillset that I offer"" This statement scares me a bit. You don't just have or not have a web development skillset. Likely the difference between you and someone with a pure web development specialty is very very large if you have not made it your sole focus for a long time. 

Also generally if you can do 3 different things well you don't magically get 3x more time to do each of those things. Hiring 3 people who can do all three things might not be more valuable than hiring 3 highly specialized people who can spend more time perfecting their respective discipline. ",1539285722.0

In an IDEAL project/team, we start by assigning people on the team something to look for (called ""coding"" in old-school research terms) and then we synthesize by listening together and each doing our part to write on stickies. We usually have pre-determined things we're looking to find insights for, usually from a pre-pre-discovery process that would have happened prior to the interviews (some quant data-driven or often business need-driven ideas). We align the stickies to those categories and draw themes. We rank stuff on a four-quadrant map to determine priority, importance, etc. The highest ranking ideas/themes get highest priority when we start designing and user-testing.

To document the synthesis: I am old school I guess. I fucking LOVE a well-categorized spreadsheet.... We rarely have the time to do this but its worth it... Sticky notes get lost.

Well run Agile doesn't demand specific schedules in order to function properly, you use what you have and ajust to the circumstances on the ground.  Your scenario is VERY COMMON.*  

**A way this can work for you is parallel work until you're up to speed.**  Your dev team is working on a feature NOW and you are in-sprint and have to come up with something.  So seat of your pants, use heuristics and make judgement calls.  If you have the resources fling a prototype up onto usertesting.com or something and get ANY feedback.  If you can squeeze a bit more into the sprint, a proper content inventory, competitive analysis, user journey, task flows, these will not only help with the current feature but they will feed into a larger vision for the product.  Do incremental vision exercises with each feature until you start to put together a back burner full view of the product! Get in user research when you can and continue to feed that parallel visioning project.

At every stage of the process identify ""experience design gaps"" - areas where you're flying by the seat of your pants and which need deeper research.  This is experience debt and it needs to be represented.  Do you have scrum masters? Ask them how to document and maintain this - it is essential to reporting.  You don't want to get blamed for scheduling or resource challenges if you don't have an extra sprint or two ahead.  

Same goes for a Design System / Design Pattern Library / Brand Guide.  Figure out a way to keep feeding it - design a governance strategy so that you can identify milestones where you've fed a component enough to call it a standard.

damnreeder,"I was the sole Product designer for 2 iOS, 2 Android, and 4 web devs for 2 years. In that arena, it was a lot of cutting corners on wireframing, testing, and analytics. So, mainly a UI designer doing best practices & competitors research and hunches from 10+ years of design. Since iOS is 80% of our users, I would usually work on iOS first then share feedback with Android team members as they interperetted the iOS designs. 

Since getting a 2nd designer to focus on web, we've both been able to spend more time doing up front research > mocks/prototypes > user tests > hi def + animations/interactions > user test > final output with iterations the whole way through.

As for process

Small projects:

1. Look at data or get feedback from customer service/biz/PMs to find a problem or need
2. Same day mock up variations
3. User test/itterate
4. Hand off assets/screens/animations to devs
5. Review with devs

Usually in the same sprint



For larger product changes/new medium sized features:

1. We usually get the idea from the PMs 3-4 sprints ahead of dev. 
2. Go through itterations for a sprint or two up to hi-def.
3. The sprint before we bring it to the devs/PMs/any other necessary stakeholders and run through designs/findings to make sure we're not crazy and get everyone on the same page. Itterations if needed.
4. Document as much as possible (user flows showing comps and notes on interactions, Invision prototypes, animations in principle, business logic, client notes, etc).
5. Break out assets and support through devs as they code in sprints.
- this is where we change to agile -
6. Through each sprint issues, limitations, or developer ideas require changes. We'll work through them as quickly as we can to accommodate devs. Sometimes stories get pushed to following sprints.

We are always working on different parts of this process for multiple projects simultaneously. That's why we get info really early if possible.

queensendgame,"> To compensate I spend a heavy amount of time collaborating with devs to ensure various projects leverage the same styles.  

People have covered the agile part of your question, so I will cover the other part:  

By UI specs, do you mean things like measurements and color values? Or explaining user flows/transitions? If it's basic things like measurements or handing off icon assets, look into an automated solution like Zeplin. I started using it with the development team and it has improved the accuracy of screen output significantly. I'm in a role where I serve as the bridge between development, design and product, so I am often the one reviewing screens for accuracy against spec. Zeplin standardizes a lot of the handoff process and you can even export differently based on the type of project (iOS, Android or web).

tokisushi,"Contrary to popular belief, UX does NOT need to be one sprint ahead of their dev team. I am currently on a product team with 3 designers (including myself), 3 mobile devs, 2 FED, 6 BE, 2 QA and 2 PMs and we have been developing and maintaining a complex product while working together in the same sprints. 

My UX philosophy is that is it incredibly important to work together as a team and share knowledge and decisions. This doesn’t mean “design by committee”, but it means that we work in lock step. The issue we had with working one sooner ahead (or let’s be real, “mini waterfalls”) is that developers were too busy trying to keep up that we did it actually collaborate, they just sort of validated what we did when they had time and it lead to a lot of “oh, we can’t actually do that” or “yeah, that will take too long to implement”.

To capture it briefly: we sketch together a a dev and UX team for 2 days and plan out the beats of our design work. When we have the core designed, the mobile devs stub out our sketches in code (no visually designed, typically using standard components or roughed out basic ideas). We test the interaction and refine then they polish the prototype. At the same time, design documents requirements, decisions, and UI. We also have a chance to refine the flow and interactions through wire framing, or bring up new considerations. Visual design can either happen right after this process per sprint OR on opposite sprints, depending on where you are and how you want to handle it. 

The benefit of this is:
-	we have a shippable product each sprint
-	we demo with stakeholders and do user testing with the real product 
-	the team always knows what decisions were made and WHY. 
-	we can anticipate roadblocks immediately and have not lost any momentum due to development surprises

There is some more groundwork to this, but I believe very strongly that the sprint ahead mentality blocks teams from doing their best work and doesn’t really help you avoid some of the roadblocks you experience with waterfall projects. ",1539090709.0

Other than that, you can pull from the same repertoire of methods and techniques. Measuring your impact should also be a bit easier because your work likely will tie closely to performance-related metrics that are already being measured.",1539018510.0
bheklilr,"Most of my work has been on internal tools.  Some of them needed a pretty big focus on UX, while others did not require as much.

Having very direct access to users was always very useful.  You can get more information, and get it more reliably.  One of the big challenges was getting some people to be willing to try a new approach that they weren't already used to.  I worked with a lot of EEs and MEs, and there was a lot of focus on making things work nicely with Excel, or working similarly to an older tool, rather than coming up with a better approach that would save time in the long run.  Luckily, since engineering hours are expensive, sometimes a manager could be convinced by making a financial argument.

Since a lot of this work was with engineers, I could also expect many of them to be more technically capable as well.  Sometimes the easiest way to implement something was as a command line tool that could be easily automated from a shell script, and some engineers could definitely do that.  As such, often I was asked to include a CLI in addition to a more traditional UI.  A lot of what I did at that job was writing non-trivial data processing tools.  Sometimes the processing could take quite a while, so having progress indicators, additional user-visible logging, that sort of thing could go a long way.  I certainly didn't have to worry as much about typography, clean design, lots of whitespace, etc.  Engineers want density and features, not flashy transitions or eye catching graphics.

Many of the other applications I worked on went on manufacturing lines, and we essentially had to build each one with two UIs, one for the usual operators that only allowed them to perform the most basic of functions, and one for debugging and diagnosing issues available to technicians and engineers.  That could be challenging, particularly because it wasn't always simple to create a view that could do what was being asked.

In my current role I'm doing a combination of internal and external tools.  The external tools will mostly be accessed by accountants, managers, and maybe some engineers.  For these I've had to focus a _ton_ more on readability, usability, responsiveness, and clarity.  I still have a lot of data that needs to be displayed, but it's a different kind of data, so instead of charts I'm having to worry about much more tabular data.  Since there's a lot of it, I have to be careful about how I use whitespace, since it can quickly take up too much room.  Alignment of related data, simple animations, and providing some useful ways to ask very specific questions of the data are all much more important than I'm used to.  I can't make the UI too heavy, and have had to come up with some interesting tricks to keep the application feeling lightweight.  It's a really different type of design that I'm not entirely used to yet, but I feel like I've had a lot of good, broad experience working on different types of applications, so I definitely know what good design looks like, and especially what bad design looks like.",1539022027.0

Ezili,"What about framing it this way - if your MVP doesn't pan out it could be for a lot of reasons - lack of market, bad product-market fit, product nobody wants to use etc. 

Your goal at this stage (PRE-startup even) is not to build an MVP. It's to validate that it's worthwhile continuing to invest in this, and challenge your most critical assumptions - That there is a market, that a product something like the one you're considering is worthwhile building, that people want what you are creating. Building the product is by far the most expensive way to find out if the product is right. Working with a user researcher could be a good way of discovering more about the type of product people actually want. Working with a user experience designer can be a good way of focusing on what the ""right"" product actually means. Have you read Lean Startup, or any similar book on working at the low fidelity stages of product development? They do a good job of drilling into what these initial goals should be. 

It sounds to me like you don't have a clear view of what you should be doing this early in the process, so my suggestion is to focus more on what your initial goals need to be and what you are trying to learn, and less on building the solution. Lean Startup is a great read.",1539004748.0

tokisushi,"Designing for mobile is quite a bit different mechanically than for the web (as you probably know, but it’s worth saying).  Depending on the size of your development and design team, you will probably want to design for maintainability, scalability, and mobile usability in mind.  This means being aware of system based standards for both iOS and Android and knowing how to use those standards to make a product that meets your needs while fitting into the mobile ecosystem and not making your developers want to cry. 

General points for mobile:

-	start from standards and add complexity only as needed. 
-	be ultra collaborative with your developers when it comes to motion. animation that seems easy can be really really hard to build and maintain without jank. You get certain transitions for free. 
-	consider making separate guides for iOS and Android that play to the needs of each platform. If you are going for hardline consistency between both platforms, favor Android patterns in general over iOS (Android gets less for “free”, so nuancing your work in favor of their standards will help. That is NOT to say just port material to iOS.)
-	if you are using a cross platform technology and not native, familiarize yourself with the rules of that platform. Xamarin Forms, for example, is really strict with how it renders while React technically compiles natively which can give you a little more flexibility. 
-	if your style guide will also act as a component library, make sure the components are functional, scalable, and smartly module. Try to be pretty strict with your components so you can reap the full benefits of them. 
-	if you are JUST talking about a style guide, make sure you name each color with friendly, human names (you can get clever if you want to, it makes it easier for devs to reference), make sure your text sizes are very consistent and intentional (if you are using accessibility font sizes / dynamic type for iOS, make sure you are following the system rules around that). Make sure your spacing fits the standards for each platform (e.g: 8dp margins on Android). Make sure your guide is complete and scalable enough that it can be used to make a totally new element without a specific visual mock-up (consistent clear use of colors, consistent margins, clear text rules, etc). 
-	Involve your developers early and often for feedback or to get help crafting documentation useful for them. Ultimately this guide is for developers, and if doesn’t meet their needs it’s not a great document. Every team has different needs, so spend time with them. 


There are probably other things that I am being a space case on, but consistency and building from mobile standards are the two most Important things, in my opinion. And making sure your documentation use useful/usable for the dev team. ",1539004204.0

scaredofsalad,"I have had a great career full of ups and downs. Great companies, ok companies,  self-employment, startups, and the best advice I could say is always look at opportunity with a “Yes and...” approach. It’s the best attitude for a designer(and really anyone) who wants to enjoy the ride. Some younger designers I’ve worked with have the perception they are limited to what their skill sets are, but this is absolutely not the case if you stay sharp, cool and keep pushing yourself. Become a designer that others want to work by using your skills to show genuine interest in their problems and you will make a list of lifelong friends and colleagues. Build relationships and include others in your process along the way. There’s always the stereotype of the snooty designer who calls all the visual and material shots, but I’ve had more personal success and learned so much by collaborating with all disciplines. I would also encourage wandering. Don’t think because you’re working in one industry now that you should stay there forever. Pick a wave and surf it. I started in education, moved into consumer electronics and emerging tech, and then medical. I took my current gig bc: 1. I was recruited and 2. when I met the team of non-designers, I knew I could make them even more badass than they already are. It wasn’t even about money. It was about experience.

I keep my personal goals broad so I can pursue any opportunities that present themselves. I never would have thought I’d have the career I’ve had 20 years ago and although it’s not what I ever imagined or really wanted, it has been pretty good.  I don’t know if I would have changed anything specifically, but I do know I wouldn’t take anything over all the wonderful, brilliant people I’ve worked with in my career.

A client doens't know the time you've put in to it. He's not being a dick. If you show work early, it's easy to throw everything you've done away. Don't focus on the details too much. The client isn't going to see them.

\- When showing your work, print it, hang them and ask the client to review them in silence. If they have feedback, ask them to write them on a post it. First Reaction feedback is worthless. More often than not, people need a moment to gather their thoughts before they can give valuable feedback.

\- Be honest. If you don't know the answer to a question: just say so. There is nothing wrong with that. If you don't know how to do something: just say so.

\- Don't underpromise and overdeliver. That just sets the bar way higher for the next time. Just promise and deliver. Be realistic about it. You don't want to be a slave 24/7 to your work.

\- Take a break while designing. Go out for a walk. Staring at your screen doesn't make the pixels move magically to the right place, but going for a stroll can. For some reason.

\- Make small decisions based on data, big decisions with your gut. But each big decision still needs to be validated. Test, test and test.

\- If you want a salary increase, just ask. It's scary, I know. But managers get that question all the time. If he or she says no, ask what you need to improve. Show a willingness to learn and grow. That is what managers want to see.

\- Set short and long term goals for your self what you want. Do you want to learn how to use a tool? Go for it. Take a look at your current project and see if you can use the tool in some way for it.

\- If giving presentations is very stressful for you, tell it at the beginning. Tell them it's your first time and would love some feedback in the end about what to improve. 

Man, I could go on for a while.

Last point: don't forget to have fun! Do some weird ass shit with your designs from time to time. Even if you don't plan on showing it to anyone, go nuts with gradients, brutal, flat design, emojis, wacky animations, weird copy. Don't take your designs, and yourself, to serious",1538946253.0
Taxed_,"* Failed highschool, wrote an apologetic letter to get into university through discretionary entrance
* Studied computer science, got bored, failed a bunch of classes and got put on academic probation
* Switched major to design for technology, found it fun, but alternated between slacking off and failing classes and getting A's

I've never had to negotiate salary because I've always felt like I was getting paid more than appropriately for my level of experience. I am good at what I do and I am even better in interview situations, this has been one of my single most valuable skills. Get good at answering questions you don't know the answer to, if you can convince someone you can tackle a problem you know nothing about then you will set yourself up for success.

Another tip I can give is that if you are in a corporate environment, you want to be involved in the most important and most exciting work. I did quality work for several years that went largely unnoticed because it was tucked away on projects no one really cared for. As soon as I got involved in ""important"" work I was getting glowing performance reviews and everyone was singing my praises.

My entry into UX wasn't standard, I wasn't a hard worker during school and I was lucky to get the starting position I did. I can't see myself leaving the industry any time soon, it's in a great place right now.",1538952035.0
Riimii,"Well, I haven’t gotten very far, but I can talk about how things have been up to this point.

I studied design and computer science in college. My first job out of college was at a software company where I was an interface designer. After a few months, I became more of a Jack-of-all-trades since the work in my line of business started to dry up. I got really close with the researchers and learned how research informs design in practice. I also started working on a product team where I was mentored by a senior designer. She was an expert at collaboration and wrangling people together. Working so closely with the developers on that team showed me how design and technology *should* work together to guide the development of a product. 

I left that job and job hunted for a couple of months. There was a lot of negativity at that company that I didn’t mention here, and I wanted to take my time with interviewing. I got a few offers and accepted the last one that I received. I still work at that company a year later. I’m currently working on a challenging project that gives me a lot of visibility, so I’m excited about that. I like my coworkers (for the most part), I’m gaining a lot of soft skills, and I’m able to dedicate time to honing my craft as a designer.

—

I won’t dwell on the things that I dislike about the field, but one of my biggest issues (and I’ve mentioned it here before) is the number of bullshitters. There are so many people who have no clue what they’re doing and can’t be bothered to learn. People are in such a rush to say they have this title or work for that company that they don’t focus on the actual work.

What I love about this field is that you can never learn enough. The cross-disciplinary nature of this field means that there’s always more to learn: more competencies to study, more people to learn from, more approaches to practice, etc.

What’s also fun is the opportunity to have a real impact in someone’s life, even just a small one, through your creativity and thoughtfulness. It’s such a privilege to be entrusted with that responsibility. 

—

Salary increases and negotiations are really hit or miss for me. I stay up-to-date with the industry, so I have a pretty good idea of what I could potentially be “worth” at a comparable company, but the pay bands can still be so wide. As an employee, I have requested a salary increase twice (two separate jobs) and have been let down once. The second time that I requested a raise was when I actually got it, but it was too easy. That made me think I low-balled myself, even though I thought I overshot. 

—

All in all, I love this field. I love design, I love technology, I love research, and I love learning. My advice to you would be to develop a reverence for research, even if it’s not something you plan to do in your day-to-day job. Remember your users in all that you do, especially when you find yourself making tough decisions that involve them. Make friends and learn from your colleagues. Be an observant person and try to learn first by watching and listening. Find mentors in various areas and let them guide you. 

Good luck!",1538954618.0
ed_menac,"My path:

* Study BSc psychology  (+ 2 months interning in UX)

* Grad job as UX researcher (~3 years)

* Second job as UX designer (~2 year)

* Promo to 'senior UX designer' (2 year and counting) 

My job:

Although my title is senior, that's only in relation to my colleagues. I'm really more your standard middleweight in terms of the level of detail I will define in my work.

I spend the majority of my time working on the development or CI of our web software. Occasionally I will have the opportunity to define, add, or omit large elements of functionality. However much of my role is working with the product owner to decide the best way to **implement** a feature which has already been defined by stakeholders.

I speak to real users probably about once a week. On a typical day I'll be involved in discussions with colleagues who are intimately familiar, or explicitly acting as proxy for our users (e.g. relationship managers). This is usually for determining user needs at a macro level, or presenting early designs for feedback.

I don't get to do actual lab testing nearly as often as I'd like. It's every few months if we're lucky, so I am pressured (mostly by dev schedule) to get the usability right first time, or close. Obviously that's not possible, but my experience conducting thousands of hours of user research in the past has given me reasonable confidence with plotting out feasible design solutions.

I'd say my job is about two thirds 'consulting' and a third 'wireframing'. Consulting includes gathering requirements (internal and external), ideating solutions, and testing these concepts (internal and external). Wireframing includes sketched designs, mock ups, and clickable prototypes.

I have an interest (though no training) in the visual design side of things, but I would certainly love to carve out more time for it. Who doesn't like to present gorgeous wireframes instead of scruffy boxes and lines?!

Things I hate:

Anyone outside my team prescribing the UI. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate input from people's area of expertise. But don't tell me if that ""needs to be a button"" and to ""put it in a pop up"".

Things I love:

Everythinggg. UX is great. I'm a complete dilettante, so a discipline with so much variety, and so many niches and nooks to explore is honestly a dream. I enjoy making art and graphics, I like writing code  (even though CSS is black magic to me), and I enjoy tackling tough problems and emerging with a viable solution.

Plus it always feels like you're doing some 'good' in the world by making stuff better and easier (though I do work for a charity, so YMMV).",1538946156.0
,"Multiple careers in front line customer service while moonlighting as a designer. Graduated top of my class but overloaded myself as I ran my own business to make ends meet during the Great Recession. Burned out worked an office marketers job. Got laid off because the bosses lawyers son was a psychopath and hated me because i was better than him at everything despite not working there more than a year.

Started my business back up. Now I work 3 times as hard for 1/3rd the pay designing websites (I’ll spare the bs jargon “digital brand touchpoints”) that are functional and based around “I’m the most hyper critical and lazy person ever. How would I want a site to work” and clients love it. I cry sometimes with a bottle of cheap scotch in my arm at night because I never see the sun anymore. But when a project is finished I sit back and marvel that I alone made that shit happen.

My wife thinks I’m mad. She also thinks I’m a genius. She thinks it’s hot. Between exasperation for my work hours and her love for my mind my artistry and dedication makes her so hot she rides me like a rodeo stallion when I come to bed.

tomatillatoday,"I am new to UX but have been in various design fields since I was 18. I’m 28 now. I went to undergrad for graphic design then switched to industrial design (the original “product design”) my second year. I loved making physical things and designing solutions. After graduating, I got into the furniture and interiors biz. My first job was at a small design-build studio. I wore every single hat from design to business operations to customer care. I learned to juggle lots of tasks and how to deliver an impeccable customer experience. I learned to collaborate with my fabricators, vendors and salespeople. I burned out. 

My second career iteration was in museum and exhibition design. It was very fun and intellectually stimulating but it didn’t pay well. I learned to tell stories and control narratives. In a way, I was an information architect working in 4D because I had to deliver an immersive storyline for people to walk through. I learned to break down complex information and spoon feed it to a wide audience. I realized I can’t design for people without research and testing, but the timelines we worked with did not make that feasible each time. Even though my job involved bragging rights to dinosaurs, I left. I was also getting more interested in interactive digital design. 

I took night classes in UX/UI design for a few months while still working at a museum. That combined with building a network over the last year landed me my first UX job. As excited as I am to start this new chapter, I predict I will have a lifetime of career pivots and I am totally fine with that.

livingstories,"Before college: Liked generating art on computers. Thought about graphic design sometimes. Mostly liked to paint.

In college: Majored in fine art, and my art was focused on using art to solve all the world's big lofty problems (which is more like design, really). also, lots of writing and computer classes for ""fun"".

Last year of college: Randomly took a design course and realized this was actually what I was doing. 

First year after college in 2010, because #FML: Took an unpaid internship (don't ever do this) at a nonprofit (they don't pay well). Worked 3 service industry jobs and applied to grad school for info studies an design.

Grad school: Learned what the term ""user experience"" meant. Taught some hands-on classes as a student teacher which ultimately helped me learn more. My thesis was about information architecture and usability.

First 2 years after grad school: Took a jr. UX position. Did not know what to get paid and did not get paid well. Pro tip: Always ask for more money than you think you should make. These are well-budgeted jobs. 

Second 2 years: Took another job that was kind of a weird one. I was at an agency and my role was like half project mgmt half UX designer and I was the most senior on the team. I worked with some major assholes at this job and cried after work every day. It was awful.

Last year:  I quit the above job and freelanced for 6 months. My primary freelance client was really cool. It was a 40-hr a week contract so I had reliable income for most of the 6 mo. period.

Last year through today: When one of my contracts ended I randomly applied for a full-time role at a big-name company and got it. Now I am a ""product designer"" AKA someone who does every aspect of design, including research, UI, and UX writing, strategy documentation. I love the people I work with but its not the most interesting subject matter. that's the one thing I miss about agencies -- sometimes agencies get cool trendy clients with interesting subject-matter.

AfricanTurtles,"Hey all. Not sure if this is a correct place to ask for feedback, but as I am hoping to become a UX Designer in the future I am looking for feedback on a music player I designed. This would probably fall more into UI than UX, but this subreddit is far more active than UI Design's. I am going to school in January to start Interaction Design studies, but this is good practice until then.

Any comments on what you like or don't like about it are welcome. Basically all I tried to do was look at Spotify, and Windows Media Player in order to take what I liked from both and combine them into something else.

Some issues I myself see with it:

1. You can't scroll through it which limits the number of songs I can show (you might notice the second album has 8 songs instead of 11 like it should). I am not sure if you can scroll through a prototype in Figma.
2. Using a gradient background made it difficult to choose a colour to show which song is selected (so I instead settled for a check mark).

Here is the link: [https://www.figma.com/file/Df0kOE5qFWFfN2zcOLx7ifIZ/Design-Challenge-7-Music-Player?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/Df0kOE5qFWFfN2zcOLx7ifIZ/Design-Challenge-7-Music-Player?node-id=0%3A1)

What skills will make me more valuable for a ux designer position? I graduated from school in 2017 from a design program that was heavily focused in digital projects.

I'm trying to figure out what to focus on and how I can differentiate myself from the other junior-level ux designers. Networking I know would help too, but it's kind of limited in my small city.  


Semi-related in terms of networking, but I was also thinking of getting a master's degree because I'd love to learn more, work on cool projects, and meet new people I can network with/learn from.

Parkreiner,"I'm just about to turn 25, having dropped out of a math major at 19, and am getting sick of working the gamut of retail and low-skill/pay jobs. At the moment, the two potential careers that interest me most are front-end web developer and UX designer. I've been teaching myself programming for a while now, so that I have some foundation in it, regardless of what I pick, but I still have two questions:

1. What's the best way of getting involved with UX (either to test it out or to get more involved), especially for someone who can't exactly afford schooling right now? The Interaction Design Foundation seems promising (especially its 'Become a UX Designer from Scratch' course), but I don't know if there's anything that I could tackle even before that.
2. How transferable do you think the skill sets between the two are? If I decide to switch careers later on, would that be a hard transition? I keep getting conflicting opinions on the importance of coding for UI design.

At least on the surface, it seems that getting a front-end job would be easier, because there are more junior-level jobs. And provided that one of them could give me a decent wage increase, it'd make it easier to pay for the [Interaction Design Foundation's $150/month membership](https://www.interaction-design.org/join).

NotARealDevAtAll,"TL;DR: Is there any hope for someone entering this field without a degree? 

Long story short, I've worked for two agencies over the last 4 years doing custom theme development for WordPress. So just HTML, CSS, PHP, and a little JavaScript. Nothing impressive, but I truly don't have a huge interest in doing primarily coding for a living. I enjoyed designing the sites fair enough but always felt like I had to leave them before they were fully actualized (small agency problems). I have 7 years of customer service experience as well, if that matters.

I'd been doing graphic design during that time as well and that has been what made me stand out for job opportunities previously. I went on to win state-level awards in both logo design and web design, along with numerous merit awards. So I can at least say I have decent design sense. 

Over the last year, I've found myself becoming so enthralled with usability. I've done what I can to pull in some user experience concepts into our rapid build timelines, but it's just not practical for the level of work we are doing (read: cheap and fast). Now, working on these low-budget agency projects where I can't properly test and optimize their functionality is really draining my motivation to work as a Front-End Web Designer.

Frankly, I'm just unhappy with my work now that I've looked so much into this world. The more I read staple books for the industry, the less happy I am with what I do for a living. I'm a detail person, so doing small budget builds was never a good fit for me. Now I just also have something that actually seems like a good fit.

I live in Alaska (not exactly a tech hub) due to a military relocation, so I'd likely have to find remote work. Downside, I have yet to find a company in this state that has a UX position. Upside, maybe that means less competition for the ones that do come around? I own a house and my husband is in school for engineering so moving isn't really an option for 3 years.

So... be real with me. Is there anything I can do to help my chances? If not, just let me know. I have great letters of recommendation, a passion for this field, and experience in a related Industry, but I am not sure how far that gets me now. 

I'm ready to accept that I have a lot of work ahead of me, I just need to know if it's worth it without a degree. Thanks in advance.

qcat1020,"I spent my freshman year as a biology major at my university and got poor marks due to a lack of interest in the subject and personal problems. I then spent my second year taking GE courses (with some psychology courses specifically) at a community college, and  am in the process of being re-admitted into the first university I left. In these few months, my passion of UI/UX design has grown and I have plans to pursue a B.A. in cognitive science after returning university. I have some concerns and would appreciate any perspectives.

• Should I pursue a B.A. in Psychology rather than a B.A. in Cognitive Science? The requirements for a B.A. in psych degree at my school are a lot more relaxed and the degree itself seems more flexible when it comes to job opportunities. On the other hand, I find the courses for the Cog Sci degree to be so much more interesting and a little more geared toward HCI topics.

• My school also offers a B.S. in Cognitive Science with a Computational Emphasis. However, there are way more difficult math and computer science classes involved in it, and I am reluctant to switch into that major for those reasons. Can I still pursue a UI/UX Design career with the B.A. instead?

• Another reasons why I am reluctant to get a B.S. rather than a B.A. is that I’d like to bring up my GPA in order to be more competitive for a graduate program in HCI/Human Factors in the future.

nickthemonty,"Hello. I'm looking to break into the field, ultimately targetting a Product Designer or Interactive Designer position in the near future. I have a BFA in graphic design and have been working for three years (a small design studio and the marketing department of a tech sales company). I'm currently enrolled in a 10-week bootcamp course through General Assembly that is set to start in two weeks, but I just received an offer for a Graphic Design position at a business intelligence marketing company making $56K with decent benefits. I would get limited UX exposure within their design department (working with two UX designers) mainly just on an internal application and a few websites. The bulk of the work would be visual design based. After asking about their UX process they specifically mentioned I would not be getting exposure to user testing, wireframing, affinity mapping, storyboarding, etc. I'm not thrilled about the job or company and on top of that, there is a 1.5-hour commute. 

In my opinion, the conservative pick is to back out of the class go with the job to see how it pans out and earn some money and more experience. While the alternative pick is to continue with the class and completely commit to learning more about the industry and different career paths (because frankly I only have a basic career path in mind, nothing concrete). I would also actively attend networking events and have access to GA's resources, alumni network, and the ability to work with real companies to build my UX portfolio. The end goal would be to get a job that I am a bit more interested in, working with a variety of projects at a company that is a bit more appealing to me. My ""gut"" feeling is to take the course, mainly because I feel that I would learn better in a classroom environment as opposed to learning only a small portion of the field in a work environment.

Any tips/suggestions/feedback or other aspects I should consider before making this decision? Thank you very much.",1539369544.0

h3110wor1d," Brief background: Major lurker around here as I am trying to break into UX (come from a consulting background). Been reading a lot about the industry and picked up a few books (The Design of Everyday Things, 100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know, etc.) as I had no idea where to start the transition.

That said, I recently attended UW's Masters in HCI+D online info session (1 year full-time program for those who may not know) and everything about their pitch sounded great!... until in the Q&A portion, they answered a question about job outcomes. Verbatim, the host of call said that:

* 20% of students have secured a full-time job by **graduation**
* 60% of students have secured a full-time job **within 3 months of graduation**
* 90% of students have secured a full-time job **within 6 months of graduation**

Is it just me or do those stats seem low/concerning? I ask this because for me to shift gears into UX (something I really think I want to do), I think the opportunity cost/risk is quite high. Tuition alone is \~50K (not to mention housing/relocation/expenses/etc.) and I would be leaving my current salary of around \~95K.

I knew a pay-cut was imminent in the beginning if I wanted to do this sort of transition (it wasn't originally about the money), but I didn't account for potentially not having a job right away AND taking on the massive debt.

Does anyone have any pointers (or just general words of advice) or have gone through a similar decision process?

I just wanted to know your thoughts on this question regarding higher education. I’m already working in industry as a User Researcher at a place I love. My place of work has offered to fully fund any type of higher education I may wish to pursue. I already have an academic background in HCI but I’m flirting with the idea of pursuing a PhD in HCI in the future with a focus on frontier type applications of HCI in autonomous vehicles and human-robot interaction.  

I’m doing some early research on different programs at the moment. My intention for pursuing a PhD is not for money or to feed my ego, but for gaining knowledge in an application of HCI I love and to become an expert on the subject and maybe work on highly specialised projects in the future. 

I’ve been hearing that sometimes having a PhD can be off-putting to hiring managers, as they may view holders as too highly credentialed/ too senior/ too authoritative. I enjoy the place I work and even work alongside a handful of people with PhDs but it's unlikely I’ll be here for life. I know contracting will always an option that will be on the table but what are your thoughts on this question.

Lincolnlogg3,"  Questions from a UX Design Newbie

Hey all,

I apologize in advance for the absurdly long post.

Earlier this year I became good friends with a programmer and he suggested that I look into becoming a UX Designer. I have always had an interest in design and I have some background in coding. After a lot of research and soul searching, I have decided that I would like to pursue this career. I have read through this subreddit’s guides and posts and have gotten several recommended books which I have started to read when I’m not busy with school work. 

Why have I decided to pursue UX Design? I have always been a creative person and feel that at previous jobs I’ve worked (accounting, bookkeeping, mid-level management) I burn out easily because these jobs don’t allow creative freedom/creative thinking at all. 

Before I get to my questions, here is a little about me. I’m 23 and currently getting a degree in Business Management. I will be done within the next few months. I live in the Salt Lake City where the tech industry is booming. 

My current plan is to absorb as much as I can about the fundamentals of UX and hopefully attend some formal classes/courses on UX Design.

Here are my questions:

1. How far can I get with self-study? I worry that with self-study I’ll hit a wall and not be able to apply the information I’ve learned. Which brings me to my next question….

2. There is a 13 week immersive UX Design course through Devmountain. However, it’s about $11,000. Is this the correct route to go? If you have taken an immersive course, what are the pros and cons? 

3. I’ve also read several posts on this subreddit about how some people have started through an internship, but I’ve noticed that those who have started through an internship have some background/schooling in design or psychology. Both of which I do not have. Would it be a long shot if I tried to get an internship? I am very willing to learn and after I graduate I will have a lot of time to devote to learning as much as I can.

4. What are some essential design software that are worth becoming familiar with or that you would recommend? Sketch, Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator etc. I do have some background with Photoshop.

5. What else would you recommend learning to better understand web and app development? Should I learn HTML, CSS and Java?

cas18khash,"Hey!

I started visual design with photography/composites 7 years ago and soon started doing retouching and studio shoots for modeling agencies. From there I moved on to do brochures and stationary for clients' side businesses and slowly dropped photography to do graphic design. After some time, learned Sketch and started studying interaction design on my own time. During college, spent a lot of time at my school's accelerator and did free work for some start-ups there (landing pages, user testing, discovery interviews, wire-framing, feedback sessions, etc). Above all this, last year I went through a chatbot phase; made some interactive text games and delivered 2 fairly simple bot projects to clients and studied dialogue design and script-writing to better understand text-based UX.

I'm now a year past my double major BComm Marketing and Philosophy and continue to do freelance visual design and some web design. Finding Webflow changed my life - as now I can go from wire-frame to delivered website all by myself.

Now here's my issue: I can't do Webflow front-end forever and I want to kiss the freelance life goodbye at least until I'm a senior practitioner. If I don't really learn CSS Grid and the more complicated parts of JavaScript, I won't be much use to any team except agencies that fully run of Webflow. At the same time, coding is probably not for me. I'm extremely visual and have to 'architect' everything as a visual image to understand it and this makes me really really slow at coding.

I'm looking to find a full-time job in \~6 months. Is it better to stick to JavaScript and learn how to be a good collaborative coder (e.g. read Clean Code and Clean Coder) and go into front-end or take a bunch of UX MOOCs, build my portfolio, write case studies, and go into UX?

(TL;DR also) I just feel like maybe it'd be naive to go into front-end now, given all these visual design systems. Who knows, maybe in 5 years we'll have GANNs that take Adobe XD files and push out ready-to-use front-end builds. What would you do? Should I go after the more abstracted career (UX) instead of the more hands-on / practical one (front-end)?",1542311128.0

**tl;dr Learning UX design so far just seems like a lot of reading and I'm not exactly sure how to begin building my portfolio.**

I just left a Full Stack Web Development program about two weeks ago. It was supposed to be a 6 month program that was extended to 11 months through poor management by the administration. By the time I left, it was still going but I realized that I was no longer interested/burnt out on programming. In the weeks leading up to my departure I had been considering moving to an area of tech that fit my temperament and thinking a little bit better and that's when I stumbled upon UX Design.

From everything that I've read about it, it seems perfect for me in terms of the kind of work I actually like and prefer to do. So since the leaving the program, I've been looking into developing a UX specific portfolio, but I'm kind of at a loss as to how to start projects. I've watched a couple of series on YouTube and have started following some designers (Jessie Showalter, Mike Locke, DesignGal) and I've downloaded a couple of the mainstay books that UX developers should read including Don't Make Me Think and The Design of Everyday Things, I've also installed a suite of Adobe programs to begin learning wireframing and prototypes. I've also got a friend who has asked me to design and build a website for them, so by the looks of it, I should have what looks like a decent novice portfolio.

I guess what I'm wondering is, how long from the point I'm at will it take me to land a job in this? It seems that learning this stuff is largely a matter of just understanding the concepts and methodologies. I've been doing more reading than actual project creation and it's kind of leaving me at a loss for how to begin putting together my portfolio. Like, how do I take a project from beginning to end? Given that I wasted so much time in my previous program, I'm really itching to work and I want to learn this stuff as thoroughly and efficiently as possible so that my interviews go well and so that my projects reflect my initiative and passion for this field. I'm not someone who likes to do things halfway and after [the thread on ""charlatanism,""](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/9x0v1m/can_we_have_an_honest_conversation_about_the/) I really don't want to come across as that.

For what it's worth, I have a degree in Linguistics and did my minor in Philosophy with a focus on Art and Psychology. I also have projects from my development course that I might be able to spin into UX projects, but I'm not sure how. Any and all advice is much appreciated. Thanks for reading!",1542588613.0

**TL;DR: Worked in theatre for years. Want to work in a creative job where I actually make a living wage. Would it be better to do an MA Interaction Design and teach myself graphic design, or a BA Graphic Design and explore UX myself?**

&#x200B;

So, way back when I was a teenager I knew I wanted to study either art or theatre. I was always very visually creative and a pretty good artist. It was a tough decision but I ended up doing theatre and having worked in the field steadily for the past few years I'm now slowly falling out of love with it for a number of reasons, the main one being lack of job security and basic income (yes, I was warned). 

&#x200B;

So I'm currently looking at making a career switch, and UX has piqued my interest—but I'm torn. 

&#x200B;

Alongside making theatre, I have also worked for two different online art/design magazines where I learned the basics of HTML, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and gained a real appreciation for good web design. These are skills I really enjoy, but my role there is always a journalist/writer rather than as a designer. I'm also an avid gamer, so good/bad UX is something I've always been conscious of. I reached out to a local university recently about whether I would be eligible to study their MA Interaction Studies (one year) which seems to be a pretty intense, studio-based course preparing students for careers in UX/UI, Web Design etc, and they said I would be eligible. 

&#x200B;

I also reached out to their graphic design department who said I could probably gain entry onto the second year (of three) of the BA course. This appeals to me, but at 26 years old I'm hesitant to spend two more years in a university environment. 

&#x200B;

From doing research, I love how varied the role of a UX designer sounds—and there's weirdly more than a few parallels with theatre making—but I'm concerned the job itself would be too technical a role and not visually creative enough for me. 

&#x200B;

So here's my question: how much do the roles of a graphic designer and a UX/UI designer overlap in a professional environment? Would I be better off studying MA Interaction Design and using intense, self-directed study (and the benefit of being in a university environment for a year) to teach myself graphic design skills on the side, or would it better serve me to study two years of graphic design and then investigate UX later?

As a solo UX designer junior, I was awaiting for a mentor for a while (he was on sabbatical), and in that meantime I was given tasks that I was of course, new to. These tasks involved: designing a feature, writing down specifications, creating tests, writing down visual state diagrams (=0 and >0 stuff), specifying how the logic of this feature affects other features in the platform ( in diagrams ). At some point I was told that I needed to describe things in boolean so that the programmers would understand it. Now, there's a substitute mentor for me and he's telling me that a lot of this far exceeds what the role of the UX designer does. I'm a bit confused. Can anyone give me some clarification on this? I want to do my role very well, and at points I'm not sure if I'm being expected a lot more than what my role should be.

Hi all,

After working almost 2 years as a UX designer I've landed a job at one of the biggest tech companies in the world (name withheld) as a Senior Ux designer.

I'm very nervous but also very excited. I still have time to start the role, so I've been doing a lot of reading, going through everything I learnt so far, making sure I visit their sites and use their products on a daily basis.

I just want to make sure I'm prepared and have knowledge around their process and work culture before I start.

I just wanted to get your opinion/advice on;

\- When did you become a Senior UXer and how was the transformation?  
\- How did you go on your first few months?  
\- Were you nervous or know what you were doing, how to tackle things and ask the right questions?  
\- Were they expecting you to get involved on big projects or start with smaller ones first?

Also do you think it's a good idea to get in touch with my manager and ask if I should get prepared for any projects ahead, ask access to softwares they use so I can play around and get familiar with them. (They use a few that I'm not familiar with)

I know I'm nervous but this is a huge step up for me. I want to be successful.

Not UX, just designing templates for clients. It's got some tie-in with the UX process, but I'm going for a generalist role and that's very specific. They seem ok with me working for about a year and then moving on to other jobs out of state.

It is likely we will finish the first year without ever having made a wireframe, prototype, done user testing, or iterated on a design. We all gave him the benefit of the doubt in the beginning but it has become obvious he isn't refusing to teach us design, he does not know design and is too arrogant to realize or admit this.

helpfulFrenchBulldog,"Look up lazy registration or limited feature registration as alternatives.

We recently dealt with this at my company. Here's my two cents, and it's very product specific.

If your product is very high touch/sticky meaning that users will be returning many times to reuse the product, i.e. Facebook, uber, etc... Then email verification is a must right away imo, especially if payment methods are required to use the product out of the box.

If your product is sticky and high touch but has tiers of features, with some features being more valuable than others, then it may be worth checking our limited feature registration. Upon initial sign up they can access the limited features right away, and then when they want other things they need to verify their email/change it. I personally have never used this but have heard some good things about it, I would be careful with this as its very product specific and can cause frustration if the limited features are deemed ""useless""

Finally, if your product is single use or minimal use, meaning users will come back maybe once or twice or not at all then email verification will only limit user acquisition imo. In this scenario, I would opt for no email verification because the business objective would align with the products exposure. There are some scenarios where email verification would be a good idea. This would be with highly personal products such as a mortgage or insurance. Additionally, if someone has to use your product to understand it's value, I would argue that it would be counterproductive to put barriers to entry. If your product's value is easily understood before use (ie. people understand and want to use your product before trying it), then I think email verification isn't too much of a tough ask for a user. 

For us, our product is a one and done thing, not very social email verification didn't seem necessary. Instead, we went with social sign-in options and a traditional account creation process. 

EDIT* I just want to add, I don't dislike email verification and I agree with /u/watwatwatwatwhat that email verification is pretty standard today. That being said, I wouldn't dig my heels in and hold my ground on this one. I would just present the logical arguments and alternatives.",1539649580.0
watwatwatwatwhat,"I think that email verification has become a standard in the onboarding process. From my experience, most apps/companies require it and users have come to expect it. If your onboarding flow is particularly long, I can see the concern with users abandoning your application process. However, in the end, email and phone notifications help verify users and provide an extra level of security so it shouldn't be skipped :) ",1538669597.0
Lord_Cronos,"I would likely push back against those stakeholders on this one. 

It's often entirely possible to adequately address security without requiring email verification before access to the product is granted, or as you said, restricting the requirement to only specific areas of the product where it might truly be necessary. 

You're right that it's often unnecessary friction in the onboarding experience. 

Not every email is a good lead for sales, in fact most aren't. Gating things unnecessarily sucks. Like [this Airstream](https://www.airstream.com/travel-trailers/classic/brochure/) example. In what world does wanting to view a brochure mean that I'm on the verge of buying the subject of it? It's a request for more information, that's good, but I probably haven't yet had the Aha! I need this thing! moment. 

There can be legitimate security concerns to address, and there are instances where you want to put some speed bumps into place. But collecting emails for sales is rarely an appropriate instance of that. They'll get better leads if they don't interfere in the onboarding process, which should itself be selling the hell out of why the product brings value to the user. ",1538748444.0

Plyphon,"Hey,

I spent two years working at a startup accelerator where we offered our resource for equity exchange (so X hours design/dev for Y % of their company) but also mentored founders for free.

&#x200B;

Basically, it comes down to a few small things:

\- Founders, senior staff, etc are scared of the answers. This is really the core of the issue. Entrepreneurs especially have built a career/business out of 'going with their gut feeling' and this can propagate down a startup as a culture - what this means is people mask the fear of finding their answer might be wrong with the bravado of 'you have to do what you think is right to be an entrepreneur!"".

&#x200B;

\- There are lots of emotions in the room. This is linked to the one above really, but to be a founder or early hire CTO etc at a startup you need to be emotionally invested. When people are emotionally invested, they don't usually take being told their idea doesn't solve anything for anyone very well. People's brains are very good at minimizing exposure to negative emotions, which manifests itself as a complete disregard to research and testing. I've actually seen the moment a founder realized from some research that their value proposition was rubbish but then proceeded to convince themselves the world needed the product still in the next breath. It was outstanding to watch. We withdrew further funding/resource.

&#x200B;

\- Comfort driven development. This is a phrase we coined - basically in stressful situations people default to the thing they're comfortable with. I've seen biz/sales background founders default to pushing sales pitches and ignoring execution. I've seen technical founders default to building random bits of functionality and ignoring sales & users. I've seen visual design background founders default to building lots of pretty screens and ignoring building a compelling value proposition.

&#x200B;

\- The entrepreneur circle jerk. The whole ecosystem is about pitching and raising money and GROWTH and all these big macho testosterone filled meetups and shit. No word of a lie - we were mentoring a founder on how to build her business model, she had 4 staff and £800k funding at this point and hadn't even stopped to think about what her business model was. We had to cut our meeting short as she had to run off to go and accept an 'Entrepreneur of the year award'! You can't make this shit up. The whole sphere is warped. Research falls down outside of this as it just isn't seen as having bravado and drive.

&#x200B;

Edit:

&#x200B;

\- There is also a bias for 'delivery' where research isn't seen as part of delivering. When they say UX, they mean UI designs for a screen. People translate 'move fast and break things' into 'just deliver the damn screens so we can dev it by Wednesday.'. Research isn't seen as part of delivering.

&#x200B;

These things combined often means properly designing a value prop/biz model and the associated research falls to the wayside. People repeat the 'fail fast and fail often' mantra but in reality people hate failure and avoid it at all costs.",1538992612.0
Leon_Phoenix,"It's not just startups. UX is a widely misunderstood concept and a very underutilized one. I'm as sick and tired of not being able to do my job properly as projects are sold poorly and if there is ever a need to cut something, it's ALWAYS from the design part. Business stakeholders always think they know their customers and they are always wrong. Not entirely, but enough so. Then you're stuck doing UI design with questionable specifications and die a little inside when people at some point go ""huh, this aspect/feature is pretty shit but there's nothing we can do about it anymore"".",1538640169.0
TheForthright,"I think there are two separate elements at play here. First, generally UX is still under-appreciated in most firms and their leadership. This is not a good reason and should be fought against, best way is to focus on total costs and the great return on value.

&#x200B;

For startups in particular it depends on their size. Everything takes time/money and focus and everyone wants their priorities to be heard (Marketing, Finance, Development, UX, Sales etc.). Sometimes it's the same as above but sometimes they are right. You don't always have time. Existence is the first feature and sometimes that's what you are fighting against in a startup: A bunch of existential threats. Fundamentally UX is about creating stuff that doesn't suck. For startups, making something that sucks is a necessary first step far more important than anything else. ",1538655106.0

Yeah, you can possibly get your role title switched, but it will probably be UX in name only.

So simply dropping a UX Designer into a company that has no familiarity with User Experience methodology, especially when there is no UX leadership, will ultimately mean that you are fighting an uphill battle simply to do anything that is actual UX.

ed_menac,"The main principle to be aware of is this:

Always make sure your animation **adds value**:

* Helps users navigate

* Maps out spatial placement

* Establishes hierarchy

* Demonstrates cause and effect

* Does something COOL! But not distracting

If an animation isn't helping, then it's hurting. Don't let it take users attention away from the task. Think about what you're trying to convey and what value it has before implementing any animated elements.

You can't learn everything there is to know about motion design from a few articles. The one you link is okay, has some useful ideas. But there's a lot more to be considered. Some of the resources about animation I have to hand are as follows:

chrin885,"Pretty good rule to follow for most scenarios.

The only thing I’ve never liked is the wording.  I’ve met a lot of people over the years that already think of the user as unintelligent and/or brain dead.  They end up using it to justify lowest-common-denominator designs (“make it so obvious a retarded monkey could do it”) or even dark patterns.  Individual conversion rates may rise, but at what cost?

I have preferred to put it in terms not of a thoughtful-thoughtless spectrum, but a doubtful-confident scale.  The user should at all times be confident, both in their ability to use the product and in your ability to meet expectations.  They should never be in doubt over where to find something, whether or not they can interact with it or what will happen if they do.  Most of the images from the article can be re-captioned to this effect; some even work as-is.

ed_menac,"I'd recommend hiring someone who has explicit experience with user testing, and can talk intelligently about the one-to-one testing they have done.

Unfortunately a lot of designers claim to have done 'research' but in reality have only used generic quant data (such as analytics) to get a general sense of user need, and have filled in the gaps with whatever they want.

Without experience of watching users interact with sites, and being able to engage with them about their goals, needs and perceptions - it's very difficult to 'intuitively' predict what will work and what will not.

Of course, even very experienced designers & researchers aren't right all the time - which is why it's important for a UX professional to encourage a workflow which allows them to test concepts as they are developing them. This isn't always possible due to business contraints, but it should be the goal.

erin_corinne_,"I see Sketch in a *lot* of job postings, so definitely familiarize yourself with that one. You can get a free one-month trial of that, so I would suggest setting aside some time and doing a project or two using Sketch during a month where you know you'll have some free time.

InVision is also fairly common. It's free for one project, so learn that one at your leisure. It has a solid online learning system which I found very helpful, but the app itself can be pretty slow.

Balsamiq is super stupid easy. If you have familiarity with editing software, which it sounds like you do, you can pick it up in no time. It's not the shiniest thing in the world, but it is really simple and you can crank out rough drafts in no time. They also have a free trial period.

I personally use XD largely because I need an Adobe Cloud subscription. Not everyone loves it, but it works and it just came out of beta recently so there will be time to improve.

Basically I would recommend at least learning the programs listed above, taking advantage of well-planned free trial periods. I would start with Sketch because it's in the highest demand. Honestly they don't take much time and the differences between them are subtle enough where you can play off your knowledge of the other programs.",1538424403.0
Kthulu666,"I think the answer depends entirely on how familiar you are with coding and what you're willing to invest in yourself and your portfolio. If you're somewhat proficient in html/css and enjoy learning about it, then by all means code it yourself from scratch. Is doing something you enjoy a waste of time? Even when it's going to produce something of value? Do you mind spending a Sunday afternoons playing around with a text editor, watching tutorials and self-educating?

I ended up switching from an extremely versatile theme to a hand-coded site because I was tired of troubleshooting why my css was being overridden be the theme. It was a significant time investment but I think it was worth it to have the ability to turn a design into a real website without making the compromises that templates and themes impose. My javascript competency is still kind of weak but I've become very comfortable with html/css, I'm not miles away from being able to call myself a front-end dev - another feather in my hat.

I found it helpful to create a codepen account so you can find examples of things you like and save them for later - lots of good demos for reference [like this](https://codepen.io/nxworld/pen/ZYNOBZ). Also, use some sort of version control like Github from the start. It's a lifesaver if you cock it up and decide you want to restart from the version you had yesterday. Pairing Github with Netlify CMS is a pretty user-friendly way to roll out changes to a live site, 

I think the general consensus is that if you're looking at a UX position then whether or not you hand-coded your portfolio site isn't very important, but it's a nice touch and definitely doesn't hurt.

A way to get full (or nearly full) control over the design without coding would be to use Webflow. It actually generates good code, whereas pretty much every other site builder generates code that's kind of cringe-inducing.",1538437725.0

After Effects very useful but it's a behemoth of an app with a steeper learning curve, takes more of a commitment than the others. Maybe take a motion graphics class for that if it's available at your school. InDesign is for print design/layouts, not really useful for IxD. The only reason I know it is because I got an associate's degree in graphic design before I went into an interaction design bachelor's program, rarely have a need to use it.

Check out [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for designing UIs. It's one of Sketch's main competitors, which I prefer over Sketch. It's free - no trial or freemium nonsense, it's actually free. It's also cloud-based so you can use it from anywhere without saving and transporting files. It's really great for collaboration with simultaneous editing, basically a google docs version of Sketch.

-dillydallydolly-,"Nothing wrong with left aligning and putting your create button first. The conventional wisdom of putting your primary CTA in the lower right corner is due to the common Z pattern reading that most (western) users employ. However in the case of multiple actions the more important thing to establish is a visual hierarchy which I think you've demonstrated well here. Your keyboard focused navigation is a unique use case as well, so don't be afraid to break from ""convention"" due to that.

Also, if this is a modal perhaps putting the discard in top right corner next to an ""X"" symbol (referencing a close modal window convention) would allow you to clean up the bottom CTA's a bit so that there are only two options instead of three.",1538403560.0
Lord_Cronos,"One argument that I've seen for right aligned is maintaining the metaphor of right = forward and left = back. I tend to be a fan of that myself, but it's also one of those things that tends not to trip people up as long as it's implemented consistently throughout whatever they're using. 

Maintaining clear labeling on your buttons as well as logical ordering of the buttons regardless of alignment is the most important thing in my opinion. e..g don't do crazy stuff like putting the cancel action on the left as the primary button along with switching the alignment. 

Your user base relying a lot on tabbing is I think a solid argument for why left aligned buttons might be better for them. Cut out a couple keypresses. ",1538404241.0
ScabusaurusRex,"A couple of thoughts:

* Your right-aligned w/ dropdown image is the best way, in my estimation.  The only concern I have is that you ensure your tab-indexes are set correctly.  No one should exit the data-entry part of the form and have the next tab selection be ""Delete"".

* This looks to be a ""Create"" window.  It's bad form to have a ""Delete"" button on a ""Create"" window.  If it's an ""Item"" window, and the window will be used for creation, editing, and deleting, some modification should take place to text.",1538407850.0
DrieStone,"If it were me, delete doesn't belong in-line with your discard and edit buttons (although I have issues with the nomenclature here too). 

Delete is a different action, and I usually make sure it's separated from my save/cancel buttons 

""Discard"" and ""Delete"" are close synonyms. I realize that you mean ""discard changes"", but one could read it as ""discard this object"".

""Edit"" also bothers me, because you're already editing... so clicking/tapping ""edit"" doesn't edit anything, it saves the edits. I would go with the standard ""cancel"" and ""save"".",1538448761.0
SombreZombie,"I think it has to do with how people read (from left to right) in the west. It is standard practice that progression is on the right and the left is reserved for going backwards. 

I think your delete and discard links should be buttons, but with a different colours. I also think they need to be labelled better. Discard and Delete could be a bit confusing. ""Save"", ""Cancel"", and ""Delete"" are most popular, and are easy to distinguish from each other.

People tend to try and do things as quick as possible. You want to avoid someone hitting delete instead of save by putting them in the logical places. You can also use colour to speed up the process, as people will generally understand that hitting the red button will erase something. Putting a red delete button on the right would go against the normal logic that people are used to, so it would provoke an increase in cognitive load for the user as they have to take a moment to think about what they are doing, and if they don't they'll end up accidentally deleting it. In my mind this would make the software unpleasant to use.

The goal is to make it as quick as possible for the user to do their job without having to think about the UI. It should come naturally so they can focus on the important bit, which is entering the data into the form.

EDIT: With regard to editing, you should use the same colours, labels and positioning for the buttons as when they are creating a new record. There's no reason for these attributes to change, and again, you only want the user to learn one type of modal layout, instead of multiples.",1538404220.0

legolad,"Funny Answer: New client research. Seriously, if you have the option, don't take clients who have unrealistic expectations.

&#x200B;

Real Answer:  First, ask yourself why you can't talk to your real end users. Are they unknown because the product is new? Is your client unwilling to pay to have you do the research? Are they employees of the company? How you answer these questions will help you determine your options.

&#x200B;

For example, if you don't have actual users yet because the product/service is new, you could look at customers of similar types of products.

Or, if you can't speak to users for financial or political reasons, you could try some guerilla usability tests where you buy people's coffee in exchange for them trying to complete specific tasks and letting you watch.

The output of that may allow you to bargain, finagle, and whisper in all the right ears to get *them* to arrive to the conclusion that if you're able to fix so many errors without access to users, imagine how many more will you be able to fix *with* users! 

Then your world will change.

HUGE caveat: do not halfass the analysis, anyone can see through biased ""findings"" if they are strictly based on your perception of the product and inconsistent application of the heuristics. 

I'd thread lightly and ""show your work"" by finding a way to translate the otherwise dry world of heuristic and task analysis into stories your stakeholders will understand.


Edit: another thing to consider is to find out if there are market research agencies in your area that would agree to find participants who are representative (demographically, habits-wise, and in terms of product fit) of your real users.

If we are talking mobile : App Store reviews can be a good place to get some hints on things that are really failing people.

Depending on the situation, you could explore finding “user proxys”. I have worked on plenty of products where we simply could not get access to our clients customers. So, we found people in the same industry/space/demographic situation and tested with them. Unless this product is hyper proprietary, you will probably get some good overall insights.

You did a nice write up but you really narrowed down your options to one, that will probably have an adverse effect on some users.

You should definitely rethink this as it could lead to current users not being able to use your login system.

User experience is the way user experience and interact with the product. Saying it has to be simple kills the range of what UX really is and washes down the potential and reality. Snapchat is hard to understand for most users but was a success for the young audience because the older generations weren’t able to adapt that far. Is it a bad ux then? No.

tokisushi,"Depends on what the account is/the type of content is associated with the account. If it is something important (financial, medical, hard to replicate or otherwise sensitive data), you will want to offer a good way to get into an account that is easy to validate, but also easy for someone to do. For example: Blizzard has you send them a copy of your drivers license and they validate key identifying information (name, birthday, and probably geographical region) with your account. Blizzard is also a good example of something that isn’t obviously sensitive (like banking information) but still hard to replicate/represents a lot of user investment (MMORPG progress).

If it is something less sensitive (like a site that locks content behind a login wall or something semi transient), I have two thoughts. One: does someone even need an account for this? Two: what is the cost of loss to a user? If someone doesn’t have access to the email they signed up with, typically I would suspect a loooong period of inactivity with your product or maybe an inaccurately typed email address. 

If your product needs a login and is sensitive enough that loss of account/starting over would be wildly frustrating, I may focus first on loss prevention (alternative contact method like a backup email or phone number) and user identity (like asking for name or birthdate, but this isn’t necessarily a great approach to non-critical services where people don’t see the value in offering up sensitive information without knowing the value to them). You may also want to consider what recovery looks like from a systems perspective (if someone contacts customer service, what do they do?). 

Providing an alternative contact method will be the lowest friction approach and most likely to be valid. If it is an opt in feature, there may still be people who lose access to their accounts to which the question is : how much does it matter? and How would real people handle this in a CS interaction? If the data isn’t sensitive, what other ways can you validate identity? What tools would you need to do that?

Alternatively, if we are talking about a native app you can take advantage of the iOS keychain for Apple users to automatically save and populate credentials across touch points. There are other tools and options to look at for Android and web only experiences, too. I’d see this also as more of a prevention step rather than a solution to the proposed problem. 

There isn’t going to be a one size fits all solution to this. There will be some variation in approach depending on what your service is, how frequently someone uses it, and the sensitivity/value of your service. Generally, however, the above is my general approach to this space without much detail about the product or the people using it. Prevention should be your first course of action. If you need to take it further, you will very likely need more user information and a way to either strictly enforce that or accept some people will need to start over (although, hopefully that is a very very low number of the service value and preventative measures are there).",1538190355.0
Ezili,"Don't design from scratch things which you don't have to. First step, audit 10 other products and see how they do it. That way you're starting from a place of at least seeing 10 ways other products have handled this, and you can either build on the best of them, reuse the consensus, or find 10 terrible ideas to avoid. 
But if there are already products solving this problem, use them to inform your choices. ",1538153756.0
jsideris,"Depends on the application, and the reason for wanting to restore the account.

My default solution would be nothing. If you lose access to your email, re-register with a new email. Why not?

But let's say it's a service where you want to keep the username. For instance, an online game. Best UX option: allow people to sign in with their username in addition to their email. I'd argue that this, on its own, is less secure than an email login, because if usernames are visible, it opens up the doors for hackers to attempt brute force attacks to target and crack accounts, which would need to be handled separately. Not a UX issue, but a design consideration in general.

If that isn't an option or you want to preserve other sensitive account information or guarantee one account per person, only then should you proceed to other account recovery options. Since this will be rare, in some cases you could just allow it to be handled via a form and manual audit. IMO it really doesn't matter how bad the UX is in this area, because the vast majority of users will never see it, and it's not like you want to encourage people to be doing this.",1538196718.0

Two hour task was far more ethical, the massive projects are essentially free work. I make sure to share a ‘viewable’ only google doc link to prevent them from poaching my work; I revoke access once the interview is over. 

Someone who interviewed me was recently fired for giving me 3 days to do a project that would take 2 weeks IRL. It nearly killed me and when I presented my findings, he was an hour late to the interview, took A LOT of notes during my presentation and at the end told me if I didn’t get this job it was because I had less experience, not because I wasn’t good enough. I contacted their HR when I lost the position to someone who had slightly more experience, because that was the deciding factor all along, not the unreasonable project. HR subsequently emailed me to say he had been let go and my feedback played a role in his dismissal... that wasn’t my intention at all, and I still don’t know how I feel about it.

So, what this means is you have to figure out what you really want out of this job, and then you can plan out your first 30/60/90 days. If what you really want is exposure to good UX work, you probably won’t find it in this job, so you will need to seek it elsewhere through books, forums, and mentors.",1537918112.0

Ginmau,"I might have to agree with @Riimii about them expecting more UI work than UX work. Not to say they don't value the UX work, it just means they'll probably be expecting a lot more design work than research, analysis or strategy.

Despite that point, there are ways that you can be the ""soldier"" of change, show your chops as a UX professionals and bring value to the company.

1. Whenever you have to design something new, ask the simple question of the reasoning behind the design. Is it a whim or based on some data/research? It also shows your colleagues and bosses that you're thinking beyond just designing something because...
2. Does the company have a clear set of goals and objectives? If not, how can you contribute to that vision? Interview colleagues and stakeholders? Competitor analysis? You can use the excuse that you want to make sure you know the company well so that you ""wear the hat"". It shows they you're thinking beyond design and thinking about company needs.
3. Who are the users? Has this been established and is the data sound? If not, how can you get that data? Can you identify the main needs and frustrations of those users? Will they let you talk to users? If so, jump on that opportunity and share your process, schedule, the data you obtain and the insights.
4. What works and what doesn't work in our current offer? If you can identify features that aren't used by users, that's a great opportunity to slim down. If there are features that need more attention, identifying them is also invaluable.
5. Someone mention a design system. That brings a lot of value for sure, but approach this on a more global scale. Is the work your doing and the offering scalable and adaptable? Can it easily serve large enterprise customers? If you need to work on one feature or module, can you do it without having to change everything else? (Modular building blocks)
6. Run workshops with colleagues and stakeholders. This is a great way to call attention to your work, bring colleagues together and get great insights and information. Brainstorming sessions, Insight analysis etc. This shows initiative and that you can get more people solving the problems.
7. Collaborate with colleagues. As stated, you're a UX team of one, but UX is created by everyone. You are a facilitator, so bring colleagues into your processes. Include them in idea generation. Guide them in the processes as well

These are the ways I usually approach a new client, team or company. Any if not all of them can be done while designing what needs to be designed on a day to day basis. Start introducing these points as you go along. The more people see the impact of a UX approach, the more you will get support and grow.

Hope that helps.

IAmNoShakespeare,"Are you working all alone or did you have a note taker present?

If you were alone I'd ideally find a note taker to observe from another room. Generally I design a spreadsheet that reflects the discussion guide and the note taker then types directly into it, making so much more easy when it comes to analysis. If the notes have been typed in roughly in line with tasks/questions/observations in the guide, it isn't hard to pull out themes. 

However, I have found myself working alone before so I'll tell you how I do that.

Generally if I am alone and going to be doing the analysis and note taking and moderating I keep a notebook open and handy and have sort of learned to write in it without looking at the page (granted it looks awful but it's just for me so who cares right?) so that I don't look away from the participant if they are talking to me. However, at the start I tell them that I may look down but not to worry because I will still be listening. When it comes to themes, I circle or underline or put a star next to something that I have heard before and note the time shown on the screen, making it easy to locate the moment later. This saves so much time later because I like to pull direct quotes.

If I have a chance between sessions, I might blast the notes into a Word document. However, this is dependent on the length of the sessions and how much of a gap I have so it's on my ""if I can"" list. It just makes reporting easier as I can copy text directly and pad it out.

When it comes to analysis, I have whiteboard static sheets that stick to the wall in my living room and that's just a way for me to get themes somewhere easy to play around with. Maybe post-its, often depends how I'm feeling and how much time I have. RealTimeBoard is also excellent for this if you are short of space, if you haven't used it it's both free and easy to use.

I then get all my main points out and review the timestamps for clarification on any points. The timestamps I note during sessions have been a lifesaver because often it takes me to a 10-20 second clip that illustrates the finding I'm trying to outline. I then report in whatever way the client wants (usually a powerpoint deck) and use a template that I have developed. 

That just about does it. No idea what others do but this seems to work for me and clients come back so at the very least they're happy! Hope that helps.",1537905080.0

But for others it's not like this at all. I mean take a look at Blizzard. Its goal is to give a real experience, it's to inspire you to play. Or how about food apps, its goal is to inspire you to cook great food. How about that Japanese girlfriend app? That's all about immersiveness.

You can also search more generally for something like ""develop my brand"". That will find you people that don't know what to do, which can mean they speak more conceptually and can give you some interesting opportunities to meet a need. You can mine Facebook pages, Reddit, forums and LinkedIn for starters.

I've constructed entire personas based on this approach. Obviously, it would be better to have some validation of the personas involved but sometimes you just have to do the best with what is available. An additional facet of this approach can be to use a wall and use post-its to track your findings. 

Sometimes I find that simply sticking a post-it saying ""I want..."" on the wall and then surrounding it with pain points and needs is both easy for me to use and easy for colleagues to understand without getting bogged down in how personas work.

Having said that though, if you create a persona without talking to the users or having data to backup your thoughts, it's fully based on assumptions, so you could be missing the actual truth completely.

One way, is to use the Lean UX approach, which goes into creating Porto-Personas, which are based on assumptions or some, but not all of the data. Then you need to do the research to validate or adjust your assumptions based on facts.

In relation to the point of saying that the persona is 40 years old for example... you've just overshot most startups and you might be missing the important groups of users.

They will of course improve some existing problems, but for every old problem they tweaked they've added a dozen new features. This of course leads to bloated platforms that are increasingly hard to use, and in the case of smartphones –highly encourages you to buy the latest device that supports all this new bloat.

Hopefully I'm understanding you correctly.. you want a timeline for your initial work that will culminate with a pitch for the larger 6-8 week project?

So this is basically just a research paper.

The first part would be finding the edges. Who's published in this topic area and what does their body of work look like. This is probably mostly looking at abstracts and building a reading list.

Phase two is doing the readings, probably building an annotated bibliography on the topic and highlighting papers that hit close to where you're wanting to go. This phase may be somewhat recursive, because you'll surely find material worth further investigation that you didn't know about in phase one. Phase 2 will probably take the most time of the project.

Phase three is synthesis. From you bibliography, you should be able to pull out information that will strongly apply to what you're trying to do. There should really be a value proposition in here somewhere - desired outcomes.  You will define the questions you want to answer. (does habit/ritual impact our product? How do we go about using habit/ritual to reach desired outcomes? etc) This is also where you outline a methodology, (probably based on what other folks have done and published)  which will allow you to do a time/resource breakdown and will basically be the gantt chart that you pitch in your deck.",1537821018.0

A good design for a content heavy site has to focus on content findability, readability, and legibility. There are three things you need to focus on:

1. The first is your overall site architecture. Is the site organized in a way that allows users to find topics? For this, focus on card sorts to determine an intuitive site navigation for your users. Also, make sure that any search applications display the things people are searching for.

2. The second is the visual hierarchy of your pages. Proper use of header tags that differentiate from body copy (font size/weight) and good size margins that break up individual topics on each page.

3. The third would be to make sure whatever fonts you choose are easy to read and that there is a clear differentiation between headers/paragraphs and individual lines of text. I would recommend a line height that is 1.5 times your font size.

Mac OS really isn't significantly different to Windows when it comes to how you'll actually use it for designing. Same productivity methods (shortcuts, quick window management) apply to both. I switch between a MacBook at work to a Windows laptop at home with Figma on both and it's pretty effortless.

Instead, I would recommend thinking about which specific areas within your field of design you would like get stronger in and look into the ways you can do that through online courses, video material, books, bootcamps etc. These are typically much more affordable than a Master's degree and are often much more up to date in terms of the curriculum and projects you'll be working on.

The # years experience is still really seeming like the differentiator for general UX jobs I see. At 6, you're in a good spot.

You could also just tell them what you're going to do and do it. Just tell them you're going to start rewriting some of the copy or error messages or something small.

Go around your manager, talk to engineers, see if they are having issues with something. Perhaps you could make internal tools easier if they don't want you to work on client facing designs yet.

Taxed_,"Consider:

* Where you want to work, what industry, any particular employer? What do they do? Tailor your project to showcase something innovative in their field.

* The level of research/information/data available to you. It might be difficult for you to design something if you don't have enough data to inform your decisions (E.g. chatbots might be hard without specific customer research in whatever industry you choose to put the chatbot in, how might you explain your reasoning behind certain design decisions?).

* Focusing on accessbility/disability - these are ""important"" to every organisation. One of my most successful projects from University was a learning toolkit for kids with prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize faces). It was an unexplored area with massive opportunities to improve on existing services. It leaves people with ""Oh I didn't know that was a thing, and wow that looks so much better than what they had before"".

zwebb7,"It is absolutely legit to gather input from all available sources. In real life situations, we rarely have all the data and insights we would like to drive design decisions. We have to make decisions based on the information available at any given moment. Fortunately, there are some great ways to gather input when we can't talk to users directly.

Forums and comments are a great way to start. If the app is in an app store, the comments there can be especially illuminating of user pain points.

Secondary research is also a critical input, and it starts with Google. Look for relevant reports from Forrester, Gartner, JD Power, etc. -- these reports usually cost money, but one can often find free executive summaries and articles that highlight the key insights.

Competitive and comparative research is also a critical input. What are competitors doing well? Where are they failing? What expectations are being set with users in the broader marketplace? It's important to look broadly in these situations, including not only competitors but also conceptually similar experiences that may not be directly related to the experience you are designing. For example, if you're designing an app for buying concert tickets, look also at airlines, cinemas, public transit, and anything else that requires some form of ticket. You are likely to find ideas and opportunities to improve your own app.

Finally, heuristic evaluation has got to be your go-to. Based on your thoughtful expert review, what issues can you identify that may improve the experience if addressed? Basically, what sucks about the app? If you can get some other experts to do similar reviews, you can corroborate your findings, but don't be remiss in doing this even if it's just you.

At the end of the day, it's about getting enough input to generate plausible design hypotheses that can be tested and validated or disproven. At that point, I don't think you'll be able to avoid testing with friends and family, or figuring out some other form of guerilla testing. This is where we really put the user in user-centered design.",1537110720.0

Lord_Cronos,"You may be missing the point of the prompt, or at least the point whoever wrote it may have initially intended, but I think you're absolutely nailing good design thinking. The real problem, or the biggest problem, isn't always the one you're presented with first. The way to determine the real problems are almost always research, talking to people who may have problems with a certain thing and trying to figure out when they have them, why they have them, and the implications of the problems on them.

Maybe people would appreciate seamless travel, but the whole thing is moot if they don't feel safe enough to take advantage of it. In a web-app example, maybe you can find a way to redesign it so that it loads ten times as fast, but who cares if it isn't accomplishing its primary objectives as a tool of helping its users solve problems? 

It's not always a black and white issue though. Maybe both the lack of seamlessness and safety are pretty weighty problems in this case. Asking questions of design briefs, pushing back on them, is always useful. How was the problem as it was presented determined? Is it backed up by research? What are the real goals behind the project? Does a transit organization want to make travel seamless for the hell of it or is what they really want to increase engagement with their travel system? Once some of these questions are expanded upon has the identified problem shifted? 

To answer your question more directly, I think it's a responsibility of UX designers or researchers to push back on these things when being asked to work on things that might be sleek and shiny but don't truly move the needle for the users. In mature user-centered organizations we're not the only user advocates, but user advocacy is a key part of the job. Specifically the rigorous validated research backed kind of advocacy. 

In these mature organizations any Product Owner or Product Manager worth their salt will want to hear that pushback too, as well as want to be in on research and identification of problems and strategy with design. 

That's not to say that this is the way things are everywhere. There are plenty of orgs stuck solving shiny small problems instead of big difficult important ones. But when I'm hiring for teams I run, I'm looking for people thinking about what the real problem is, not just trying to work out the first thing they were asked to design. I love your thinking here. I can't guarantee that it's the route to a good grade if this is for a class or doable given internal politics at less mature organizations, but it is the route toward solving the right problems and truly helping your users, and that's the ballgame. 

Balancing differing goals, balancing certain things that might be good for sales or marketing with what's going to help the user, pushing back on design briefs and digging for the larger issues. These are all difficult things, and the latter especially tend to present much more challenging problems. But approaching things the way you have thus far is the first step in tackling them. 

Hopefully some of this helps you out, let me know! Happy to talk more about it!",1537320160.0

You know the softwares you know, and if you’re expert level you can basically pick up any other design software in a matter of days to weeks. 

Companies know this. It’s not a big deal. Learning it won’t help or hurt your chances unless it’s for some reason the only/most important software a company uses (it’s not, that’s pretty exclusively dominated by illustrator and/or sketch, and inVision). 

I’ve said many times in interviews “oh I haven’t used axure, I’ll be able to learn it in a few days” and they go “oh ok great” and that’s it. 

My last job was for one of the biggest suppliers of PC’s in the world. I told them id never used a pc in my life. They told me “we’ll you’re about to!” and yeah figured it out in a week.

brizardi,"I'm going to disagree with everyone here saying ""meh, the tool doesn't matter.""

I agree with this sentiment 100% when you're comparing tools that have *similar outputs*. E.g. does it matter whether you use Sketch vs Adobe Whatever vs MS Paint to create your static mockups? Not really, as long as you can get a good end result. Same if you're comparing tools for simple click throughs (e.g. Invision vs Sketch) or more complex stuff (Axure vs Justinmind) or slides (Powerpoint vs Keynote), etc.

What I *do* is important is having competency in at least one program per ""output"" type. If you're looking for a job that includes doing interaction and UI design, I absolutely think it's beneficial to know how to create:

* Static mockups
* Simple or complex clickthroughs
* Interface animations
* Polished slide deck

Are each required to get a good job? Definitely not. Will being comfortable doing each potentially help you get and advance in a job that requires designing digital interfaces? Yes. What tool you prefer for each is up to you.

When it comes to animation, you have Principle, Framer, and a handful of others. You literally can't make that stuff in Axure or Invision and animation programs have entirely different mental models and tricks that take a bit of time to learn and perfect.

So tl;dr if you're planning on doing interaction and UI design I would buy a subscription to either Framer or Principle and learn one of them well enough to be able to create animated interactions.",1536807016.0

i don't know what kind of ""story"" you'd like when it comes to online shopping — i think the nordstrom site does an admirable job of solving three problems: 1) making it easy to find exactly what you're looking for (searches, filters, numerous clearly-defined categories); 2) making it easy to browse; 3) driving consumers towards corporate-defined categories or markets. 

i also don't know what kind of personalization you'd want here. predictive marketing? storing your sizes? nordstrom isn't trying to run a social network or a ""product,"" they're trying to sell you clothes. they do a nice job doing this, tying their products both into trends, icons, feelings, and self-perception. some people want to be on-trend, and others don't — and nordstrom has a bunch of different ways of engaging with people on different levels between those. 

compare to other sites operating in the same markets: for comparison, let's look at [mr. porter](https://www.mrporter.com/en-us/) and [barney's](https://www.barneys.com), which are high-end department store-style online shopping. mr. porter is a mens store and is positioning itself as more of a lifestyle brand whereas barney's is trying to be a fashion-forward one-stop-shop for everything you'd want.

ElusiveAnmol,"Hey fellow designer!

You seem awesome with your work experience. 

One thing I have learnt while writing resumés is that try to use as much of the design and business terms as possible. 

I am not saying to overload your document but to use words that the job or the recruiter.

Why?

Because companies use a certain software: ATS to sift through thousands of resumés and they usually pick out the ones that cover most of the terms of the lot. 

Words and variations like but not limited to, Skills, Leadership, Drawing, Product, Management, Clients, Outperformed, delivered etc. 


Keep the layout of your resumé clean and simple.


Focus on the information hierarchy through contrast and font size.

Tailor the resumé for the job you REALLY want to get into. Not every job requires its own copy of resumé but a cover letter does. 

I am going to use the new Spiderman reference and say: Feel the company. Use their terminologies, style and most importantly, their brand color. I read that you want a job in Dropbox. I wish I can get that skilled enough to be there. However imagine them coming across your resumé as you use their brand color for headlines...you are already imprinting yourself as one of them. 

God! I learned so much while researching to write this answer. Now if you will excuse me,
I have a Medium article to write and
internet fame to gain. ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪",1536397778.0

You can answer you question most confidently by looking the browser analytics of your user base. Google Analytics is a popular tool used for this.

As mentioned below, caniuse.com is a really good resource for that. By default, they use global browser data, but you can pipe Google Analytics data in there to use it with data from your own site.

- Make the scope reasonable, but not so simple that they can bang it out on the bus enroute to the second interview.
- Make the research tangentially related to your company/business/industry, but not so specific that the candidate thinks you're getting them to do work for free.
- What do you want to get from the exercise? There should be well defined deliverables which can tell you different things. Wireframes/flow charts show aptitude in transforming initial ideas into more concrete concepts. Executive summaries show communication and writing skills. Test plans show knowledge/ability to design and facilitate tests.
- Give the candidate plenty of time to complete the task. At least 48 hours if not more.

Their portfolio is horrible. It's either not structured well, only shows nice completed projects or tells me little of the journey on how you got to the end design. As UX people we're storytellers. If you can't show/tell me the story of yourself, then it makes me think you can't get a client to invision the story they're looking for you to create for them.

People with a masters or higher in HCI automatically think they're worth more. They walk in with no real-world client projects and want me to pay them $90K+ to start. You might think you're worth it but in reality, you're not.

Learn how to sell yourself first. Be able to talk with confidence to a client. Engage and hold a conversation. Learn when to talk, how much but better yet. Learn to listen, then on the fly. Come up with an answer even if it's out of thin air that sounds like you have it all planned.

Learn to defend your design concepts, when to fight for them and when to give in.

I'm looking for people on my team right now. With only a year of really doing the work. I would bring you on as a paid intern, even if you had the degree. I need skills now, not theory and processes that in reality will get destroyed anyway.

My advice. Go somewhere that you can surround yourself with other people in the field. Absorb as much as you can from them. They will give you a far better education than getting the degree ever will.",1536284410.0
ProspectPete,"It depends..

Have you gotten any feedback on why you didn't get any opportunities you interviewed for? Is your only experience with the start up? What do you hope get out of the masters? What kind of company do you want to work for? What kind of work do you want to do? 

From my experience and this isn't gospel, the degree(s) you have and the experience you bring don't do much for you if you cannot apply it to what you want to do. Define where you want to be and research the path to getting there.

PartyLikeIts19999,"I think that design articles like this (and most of Fast Company’s content if I’m honest) are mostly just fluff pieces intended to keep traffic flowing. They don’t typically offer very much actual information, and leave you feeling somehow less informed than you were. But this one was a little different. Ignoring the vague but obvious pitch for Disney Plus wristbands at the end, there actually are some things we can take away from it and apply directly to UX. 

Hub and spoke design. People can come to an area, go back to a home page, and go to a new area of content. That’s _sort_ of what we do now, but not really. It’s more like the early internet pages before we learned how to put menus on every page and you had to go back to the “home page” whenever you wanted to go somewhere else. I also really like the idea of getting lost in content intentionally, but optionally. 

Sense of community during the shopping experience. As the author pointed out we are moving back towards markets and independent shops and away from malls. We assume that eventually this will apply to online vendors such as Amazon as well. Etsy is a good digital example of this but I feel like they don’t play up the community idea as much as they could. I’m sure there are better examples of folk economies... just like I’m sure there are better examples of main street revitalization than Disneyland too lol.

Breadth vs depth. Despite the original task of creating something for the world, Disney chose to focus on America instead. This speaks volumes by itself of course, however it had the effect of limiting his focus to a smaller area. This allowed him to go more into depth on his preferred form of kitschy American nostalgia. As we all know, naval gazing is not only an American national pastime, it’s also an extremely profitable industry. Occasionally it even wins elections. But by limiting his scope to a narrower breadth, he was able split up this deep and narrow topic into a set of broad and shallow experiences. 

I guess I should say that I have never actually been to Disneyland ... and I _may_ be just the slightest bit bitter about every single one of my siblings getting to go but not me. Anyway. I just kind of wanted to unpack some of the points in the article and connect the dots as they relate to UX ... because I kind of felt like the article didn’t.",1536223283.0

Having these set of guidelines have helped me handle uncertainties in user interviews really well. No matter what approach you choose, if you follow these seven tips you’ll still be able to conduct reliable and trustworthy research.

&#x200B;

1. **Decide what you want to learn**, and what you will do with the answers, before doing anything else.
2. **Sanity check** your research approach with another member of your team. Research projects need to be designed. What are you going to say? What will you ask them to do? As with any design, collaboration is the key to getting it right.
3. **Speak to the right users**. You should already know who you are building your product for. The next step is figuring out how to contact them. Think about the data sources you have about your users, and how you can extrapolate which users are already using your product for similar jobs. This is surprisingly easy if you’re already an Intercom customer.
4. **Don’t waste your user’s time**. Use people outside of the project team as pilot testers for your research. This will help you refine your questions or tasks, so you get the most out of the time you have with actual users.
5. **Don’t ask leading questions**. Never phrase a question in a way that prompts or encourages a certain answer (e.g. What frustrated you about this design?). This is the number one mistake made by novice researchers.
6. **Be mindful of your bias**, and don’t seek out validation. It’s important to remain impartial, otherwise you might as well make up the findings yourself.
7. **Never rely on just one set of data** – pull together all your sources. For example, analytics data can tell you what customers are doing, but not why. Consider this data as a great starting point for figuring out what you want to learn.",1536220887.0

glitchy911,"This is a great question. 

It’s also very loaded. I mean, I feel like the business way of phrasing this is who wins? The stakeholder goals or the users goals? 

The art of ux design is finding the balance there. Which in most cases, is one that does push the business goals first, but one that also allows the user to experience the application in other meaningful ways. 

For a rudimentary example, let’s say a business really wants to push their newsletter and that’s their number 1 KPI. A “dark” or otherwise annoying pattern would be: 

1. Intrusive pop ups 
2. Hiding the content behind a “subscribe” wall
3. Forcing account creation for full access 

Etc. 

But a ux designer will come in and say, okay newsletter subscriptions is the goal. We can achieve this without trapping and forcing the user to subscribe. We can show 2 page loads of quality content, and then distribute somewhat frequent “subscribe to our newsletter for x” components. That way users see our value first, and make the conscious decision to subscribe. This makes them more likely to engage with our content, keep the subscription, and tell others about us if they can easily use our website and see subscribing as an increase in value, rather than red tape to our worth. 

Frustrated users would easily abandon the first option, and seeing the command to sign up as presumptuous and demanding. Good designers will see this in advance, and fully understand how software is interpreted by users closer to how humans communicate with each other than any technology. 

You don’t want rude software. But junior designers may not realize this, and even seasoned designers can fall victim to business demands. The center-point of being a good designer is being able to communicate to relevant parties how the dark pattern will hinder their business, and how user centered design can only grow it. 

So I would argue that any ux designer who’s halfway decent at design would never implement a dark pattern. ",1536109174.0

If the story isn't compelling, the best UX won't fix it and lousy UX will sink the best story every time. Instead of UX sitting under marketing or marketing being a part of Design, it's really a partnership, isn't it? A collaboration. You both need a seat at the table.

Company B was an absolutely not, about halfway through the interview, it was clear.

enviousjealous,"Let’s start with a reality check: you’re not going to learn this stuff like you learnt a programming language. In fact, trying to do this alongside thinking about all the technical stuff is really hard. They are 2 different modes of thinking. As a one time Dev, I found myself making pretty bad UX decisions because I had a really complex map in my head of the back end. That makes it incredibly hard to “have empathy for the user”. What you perceive as a simple UI and satisfying experience is unlikely to match a real users. Especially if you’re just starting think in this way. I had to stop Dev in order to get better.

But it sound like you’re not trying to be the best. Just competent. So, i suggest you find some online courses in UI/visual design fundamentals. Then another course in user experience or information architecture. Spend those 100 hours just utterly wrapped up in thinking in a different way. 

If you’re really committed to providing a quality experience, then hire someone. And learn from them. All the best learning in this industry comes on the job and from other practitioners. ",1535949925.0
mscott087,"First step I think is getting a full understanding of what UI design and UX design truly are. Some people (mainly management in companies) think that they both are the same thing or group them together. They are VERY different. 

For UI stuff I might suggest the following: CSS(box model, positioning, grids, flex box), CSS pre processors (SASS), JavaScript (ES6), JavaScript frameworks (react, vue, angular - pick only one and master it). I’ve found the skills carry over for the most part. That’s all you really need to make things physically happen on the front end. 

For UX stuff it’s a bit tougher. There’s not “one” right answer. or path to take. This really requires either A.) having the right education...  B.) being able to empathize with how different types of people think. 

In order to be good at this you need frequently take a step back, really put yourself in your users point of view and think “hey would this be easy for them to use?”. If not then iterate through the design process and come up with something better.  People tend to think of UX/design as a once time process. But it’s something you always can improve or get feedback and then improve. There is ALWAYS room for improvement. It’s very rare to get to a spot and say “well.... I’m done!”

After that try to prioritize them with stakeholders or future users to understand what they think is needed first. Once this is done you can get more into the details of P1s and start defining the scope from what you know you can deliver (if it’s only you).

A lot of us ended up settling for contracts with other dot coms that were struggling and trying to squeeze as much out of us as possible. It meant we had to put up with a lot of abusive bullshit because there were no better options.

2008 was actually pretty good for me. I was working at a domain name aftermarket company and had the freedom to start experimenting with user research, which is now one of my strongest skills. Because I'm a designer and researcher, I'm more valuable to companies who don't want to invest in a UX research specialist, especially smaller companies.

If you're worried about a recession, the best ways to prepare are to focus on your personal finances (learn to live on less, reduce debt, start/build your rainy day fund) and establish your value (work on your portfolio, write case studies about projects you've done, and document the hell out of all the skills you bring to the table). 

If things go south again the way they did in 2000 – which I HIGHLY doubt – you need a financial buffer to see you through a dry spell, and the skills to land a half-decent job when employers have the ability to get picky.

I lead a range of UX work streams for a large UK bank and making sure UX is heard and valued is always a constant battle.

One thing we've found that helps, is making sure wherever possible, we deploy new work or improvements via A/B tests, which helps show differential in specific metrics vs. old versions where they exist.

Whilst this is not the sole purpose of the A/B testing, having that comparison can help bring the story to life a little more. 

The alternative is comparing performance post and pre delivery which can be OK, but is also impacted by so many variables. 

Additionally, where there's uplift in conversion, we will always try to attribute a commercial value where they are present to the story. Apologies if you already know this and do it! 

Example: Our recent UX enhancements to our loans application has attributed to an X% uplift in loan applications.

Each loan is worth £X. Take the uplift %, convert it in to volume over a time period and then convert the volume in to £s. It tends to make people's ears prick up pretty quick.

DeadDisciplinary,"I think the other answers give justice but I just wanted to add some tangible examples because I was also confused by this.

Usually you create your designs and provide specifications and give it to developers. Sometimes this is a long detailed document that you hand off, and sometimes it’s a many meetings with the dev team to describe and explain it. 9 times out of 10, the dev team will come back to you with questions or constraints. Sometimes you have to readjust the design if there is an unaccounted for technical issues (usually to reduce the number of times dev comes back with a problem it’s a good idea to include them early on in the process, but that isn’t always possible).

Then from there it can vary. Some companies release a product and that’s it, but some companies iterate on that product. In my opinion it’s best to release it and then get some real world data and re-iterate, but this usually depends on budget and scope. 

If you are re-iterating, you can look at features that work well, and features that don’t and move forward from there. Even if you aren’t really re-iterating there are often bug fixes that need to happen, and sometimes that can involve Ux, but sometimes it’s just dev implementation.

Im also not sure if this is good practice or not, but sometimes I use dev as a sort of “user test” for my designs, and I usually like to get their feedback. For me, this has earned me brownie points with some of them and (usually) they have good advice. It really does all depend on the company.",1535726923.0
gushon1,"I'll explain how it works in the web, because is the most basic case

Your browser renders code files and visual assets that it downloads from the internet, when you go to [reddit.com](https://reddit.com) your browser downloads a bunch of files. that means that the live website is just a folder with code files (html, css, js) and media (jpf, png, svg, gif, etc...) 

your browser is the software that transforms all of these files into an interactive website. it's like you need photoshop to use PSD files or a media player to play MP4 movie files.

HugTheRetard,"Oftentimes tech projects will use the Agile methodology to design and develop products. Agile consists of building a product backlog, essentially everything that will ever be included in the project. The backlog ideally contains feedback from the product owner, designers, developers.

Those backlog items are then divided into epics and sprints, the former being larger over-arching groupings of backlog items, the latter being more granular items. Sprints will contain user stories, typically needs and goals from the users' perspective, that will help inform the design and determine what features are needed.

Another solution is to try to cut down on the number of pages. Maybe just changing the state between different components within the same page.

Just like any product, existing materials are great for framing initial assumptions and perceived opportunities.  These are valuable for gathering interest and directing the earliest explorations.

But if you want actionable feedback, you need to throw up some material.  This can be a simple wireframe, prototype, or dummy site.  But when you put something in people’s hands, you begin the process of eliminating assumption and refining a product.

When in doubt, start simple: a stack of five-paragraph-essays never got anyone fired.  Turning a basic outline into a test page should be the work of a moment.  From there you can start adding complexity like drill-downs, carousels, cross-links and so on — testing at each stage, and adding complexity as it becomes important, rather than based on what some blog said they think you need.

Some things I can think of off the top of my head: The site has sales and they want to get a deal, then forget; they are getting to checkout and having problems, maybe on shipment or payment; they are finding better prices elsewhere and purchasing there instead; are they maybe accidentally adding items to a cart because of an unintuitive button?

I would conduct a usability test of the purchase to checkout. I'm still green at UX research so this might not be correct. But I think this would help identify a problem if it is not about prices or sales. Combined with a survey about user opinions on price points and shipping costs might be thorough enough to find out why it's so high.

Again, just spitballing. I don't know if this is best practice or would be enough to identify your problem. Hopefully this helps a little.",1535280209.0

Why is disposable research a bad thing?

Disposable means it served its purpose and was specific enough to provide value for the product at that time.

""Timeless"" research is a ridiculous concept. 

Either it's too high level to be useful or else it goes out of date quickly. 

Even psychological research expires in a pretty short span of time, and you'd think that something as stable as our literal shared biology would have a little bit more longevity than a piece of user research.

So would that be something like usability findings or insights relating to a specific proposition? Isn't that rather key to developing a good product/service?

MarcRoflZ,"Hey nea1caffrey,  

  

I am currently the Lead Product Designer of Platform, in a mid-sized tech company who also offers many web apps with similar challenges to the one you described above. I just want to start out by saying that without an in-depth knowledge of your offerings, business model, FY19+ focus or company culture surrounding design it's very difficult to give you advice on how to proceed from the point you're at. What I can do is give you high level advice based on how we have been tackling similar issues on my team and hopefully help you out in the process.   

  

So the first thing that's important is knowing what exactly your company is focusing on this year, chances are if your FY ends in October then the budget and planning for next one has already taken place. You need to know where your company stands and is looking to invest, that's going to help you make your business case as you can tailor it towards the needs outlined in the planning. If you aren't at a hierarchal level you feel appropriate enough to talk about this with your managers then you'll need to partner with someone who is because understanding this is key.  

  

The next thing you'll need to do is gather all the information you have on why this redesign is critical. Is this app highly used? Why is it used? could it be used more? Which customers own it but don't use it? Why? Which ones are using it? Are they using it for something it wasn't intended for? If you're a B2B SaaS company, is the current design hindering sales performance and affecting your ACV? Is it stopping customers from adopting the product or making it a needlessly long process? Are you losing deals to competitors? What are customers saying about this product? What are prospects saying? Look for similar metrics if you are not B2B. These will help you outline why it's such an important project to take on, and also help you align it to the focus of your company in the coming months. That's what the business cares about.   

  

If you build a compelling case here, you're company will be more willing to give you the green light. Hope this helps. Happy to discuss more if needed.

Usually for an initial validation like this I do surveys of users (or you may have a tracking in your apps, I’m not so lucky in the banking world), user flows to show improvement, and lo-fi wireframes to show the initial vision.

lozzenger2,"It's absolutely possible. As someone who moved into this field about 7 years ago without a relevant degree nor training who now works in a senior position in a well respected firm, I would offer this advice:

If you want to start, you need to start somewhere. 

Like all passions, simply bringing knowledge to the table is never enough and a degree can only ever take you so far in a field that needs to be practical. You need to act and continue acting. 

If you're not sure where to start? Pick an app you like and try to redesign it for a new audience or take an app that frustrates you, figure out why and try to make it better. You don't need any fancy software, start with sketches and paper prototypes. Test your ideas; go out in public, show your work to strangers and start asking questions. Teach yourself to listen and avoid asking leading questions. Try to watch how people react to your work and start growing a thick skin as you'll need to be able to take criticism and feedback from all directions. Document the process and repeat. 

The more you do, the more 'experience' you build for yourself. If you continue doing this in your spare time, you'll not only begin to build a strong portfolio, but you will build confidence in your ability to do this job and perhaps learn whether it really is the right fit for you.

Not sure I buy the quantitative stuff he throws out at the beginning. He gives his credentials (*""I’ve been writing trading bots and scripts in Ninjascript (C#) while studying technical analysis""*) but then offers no real evidence or data around his claims for UX jobs.

The qualitative stuff he talks about later does seem to be valid. UX needs to integrate with the business as a whole and understand its own function better.

Yapz,"It's interesting. I like how this article has kind of addressed one of my biggest concerns heading into the UX-field without really intending to do so directly.

So I've been going to uni for 3 years and I'm soon done and I've started to think about possible future jobs. I really want to work with UX because I honestly think it fits me really well! I don't do it for the money, Human-Computer Interaction and behaviour is genuinely interesting for me! I just want to create great experiences.

For my first 2 years at uni there was basically only methodologies, psychology, design and programming included in my courses. Basic UX stuff. However, at my third year, that was when everything started and they introduced business tactics and all that. I'm literally the opposite to an economist/businessman. But I had to do it and I guess it was good. We also did project planning and so on. But this course caught my attention to something I found very worrisome. It was further strengthened after some further reading and analysis on the internet.

Basically, UX is for the money, not the users. Yes I know I sound incredibly naïve. But if a company can make money from different design decisions, they will take the one that will result in the most apparent revenue. I was so let down by this conclusion because honestly I'm not really interested in that per se. All over the web I see places where revenue is placed above costumer experience. I understand that this outcome is more or less destined by how the market looks. People and companies need money and everybody expect anything for free these days. Companies need to design their products so that revenue comes from their users be it directly from them or by using them as the product.

All in all, this has left me in an ambivalent state. I love UX and what it does but when everything seem to be about money I lose some of my passion. This article has helped me understand why I feel like I do, I think. It shows clearly how the business-mind might be taking over more and more of the UX field in the future. I'm not sure how to feel about that though...

Probably, if it continues in this manner I will seek refuge in the vehicle industry. Yes, they too sell stuff but generally they are actually interested in leveraging quality products. Once their product is sold, they want their users to feel as comfortable as possible. A lot of alumnis from my university work in the vehicle industry, so it should be fine.

If you're a UX person, you should be doing this anyways. If you don't understand the business, how can you design for it? If you don't talk to other departments (especially sales), how will you gather feedback from internal stakeholders as well as external customers? As for market needs and demands, this can be as simple as skimming a trade magazine/website or talking to potential users of your product.",1537392512.0
MochiMochiMochi,"I seeing a lot of this happening here in the US from the consulting side of the business.

Increasingly, companies are folding UX duties into other roles like, for example, 'digital' strategy for marketing. Unless you have specialized knowledge in inbound marketing analysis and customer acquisition funnels, your UX skills are discounted. This happens to a lot of specialties.

Same for analytics UX. You've got to know Tableau, Power BI or whatever and have the BI skills to match... not to mention a real idea of the strategy behind data management.

Also, the entire application design space has matured into a dozen very deep, capable design frameworks fully supported with mature components, CSS, usability etc. Think Bootstrap 4 and the huge community around it, for example. Or Shopify. Why pay a dedicated UX resource when you can just tweak your brand identity onto the platform? Not to mention the incredible ease of deploying applications with AWS and Azure.

As these situations progress, a lot of stakeholders will question why a specialized UX role is required. Concurrent with that question is the issue of rapidly maturing offshore UX capabilities, which will inevitably erode the domestic UX salary potential.

The UX job is still alive and kicking, but in my opinion by 2020+ will increasingly sound like 'webmaster.' A relic of another age.

sensitivehack,"I was really ready to shit on this post, thinking he was going argue that design is irrelevant or something, but I feel like it's actually describing a lot of the experiences and revelations I've had over the last 7 years.

I might add a different framing though:

Organizations will naturally prefer roles/functions that are self sufficient. If your function's contributions do not result in direct, obvious value to the org, they will have difficulty reasoning about you and will ultimately try to consolidate your duties with another function.

I've been using the title ""Product Designer"" for about 6 years now. I came out of school all process and theory, not even a portfolio. I somehow landed a job and over the next few years, watching chaotic and dysfunctional processes, I began to realize the things that drive the process are tickets, mocks, and code. My work was always filtered through someone else—meaning my value would always be in question. So I've slowly added production skills so that now I can design and build proof-of-concepts by myself, which has proven to my current company that can I run a project with out even a product manager. The key is initiative and self-sufficiency.

UX is important, products need well thought out UX and it brings real value. But I can see why it doesn't make sense for UX to be a dedicated function because that work relies on others to realize it. (I think it can be a dedicated role, but more as a specialization on a larger product/design team).",1535045953.0

> The slowing of the bull market for UX jobs in the early spring, coupled with a new emphasis for remote UX talent outside the US. Normally this is seasonal in nature with freelancers, contractors and full time employees (FTE’s), so I’m discounting this a bit.

pipsohip,"""...so I can see more on a screen"" is a common complaint my team gets in our company, but something to keep in mind is that there is only so much information a human can take in at one time, and if you load a screen with as much information as possible it can tend to overload users. If a user has to search too hard to find the thing they need to complete their task, it makes them dedicate more focus and brainpower to completing their goal and creates friction.

&#x200B;

On top of that, the difference between the ""comfortable"" and ""compact"" display settings on gmail is only three list items on the screen, so the benefit of cramping the line size down to the smallest view has negligible effects in ""helping"" the user see more.

From a UX standpoint the thing that bothers me is that the UI is loaded with a lot of icons without labels to represent functions. l use an extension which adds a preview pane for email which makes the problem worse, and I understand that it's an app that people  regularly use, so they will learn what each icon means over time... but opening the app for the first time I felt overwhelmed by the number of mystery buttons.

Additionally I think making everything white has made the structure of the app more difficult to understand. The old app used shades of grey to break down the ui into logical sections: App toolbar, folder selection, message list, preview pane. All-white looks cleaner, but it's compounded the mystery button issue, as it's now less obvious what area the function relates too.

Most of the issues I have with Gmail are more about Google new graphic design direction. I generally liked material design, but I'm not digging the new Google theme for Material. I find the new font they're using pretty distracting. I think a UI font needs to be highly legible and bland so it can be ignored. The new font choice feels to be more out branding than utility. I also dislike the heavy rounding of UI elements (especially the very rounded card layouts) the new 'compose' button in Gmail looks completely out of place, its sizing, alignment and icon style doesn't match any of the elements around it, perhaps that's intentional, maybe it's like a desktop equivalent of the Floating Action Button used on mobile.. but it annoys me every time I see it.",1534965175.0

The vertical use of space doesn't bother me. Most of the time I don't have more than 10 unread emails and for everything else I just use the searchbar.

BTW, I'm pretty sure they added some features and options if you dig around, but before they updated the UI I hadn't really looked into the settings for years so I couldn't tell you what's new.

Personal experience of the Google Analytics date range selector:  if I mess up selecting one day, I have to deselect each wrong date and select the right date. Small problem, but clicking at a small date box multiple times a day adds up. How can the user ""escape"" when each click starts a new date range (if there were no confirmation box)?",1534910437.0

jkbrock,"I haven't read through all of the replies you've had over your several posts from the last few days, but I did kinda glance over the posts.

Long and short: I looks to me like you're thinking too broadly at this point. Asking ""can I work in UX"" is akin to asking ""can I work in science"" or ""can I work in food."" With your current experience, the answer to all of those questions is yes. Which means you're not asking the right questions of the community or of yourself.

This, however, is not meant to be discouraging. I hope to help you reframe your view to help you build a career for yourself. UX, like 'science' or 'food,' is a team sport. There are instances where 1 person might be asked to do everything, we used to call those ""web designers"" but if you want to really make amazing things, you need to specialize and team up with other people who specialize in other things.

In my experience, the ideal (though rarely existent) workflow looks kinda like this:

* A **Product Manager** has an idea for a thing. Maybe it's an app, maybe it's a website, maybe it's desktop software, hell...maybe it's a bluetooth enabled coffee pot. In the end, this thing will be used by humans. 
* A **UX or Information Architect** will come up with a high-level overview of how all of the pieces of the thing fit and work together by documenting 'user stories' and 'activity flows'. Sometimes this person even builds wireframes and mockups.
* Design Teams
   * A team of **UX Designers** fill in the gaps, laying out interim pages, defining micro-interactions, coming up running into problems and solving them.
   * A team of **UI Designers** start adding polish to the designs, matching colors and typefaces, building image assets, 
* Engineering Teams
   * A team of B**ack-end Engineers** build out the engine that makes the whole thing run.
   * A team of **Front-end Engineers** turn the interface designs into real functioning software
* Data Science Team
   * A team of **UX researchers** and/or **Data Scientists** will look at user feedback, user analytics, usage statistics, and the like to tell the Product Manager what's working and what isn't. Often they will also make recommendations on how to achieve business goals and or improve metrics on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Design, Engineering, and Data Science are in a constant flow using Agile or CI/CD methodologies, so new features are constantly being added, old features are constantly being updated, and everything is constantly being measured and evaluated.

So...now...the hard part: Who do you want to be? Where do you fit in this puzzle? 

It sounds like you already know Visual Basic you're looking at learning JS, this would likely start you on the path toward front-end development. If you're more interested in data science, Python might be a better place to begin as some of the more common data science tools use Python. Back-end devs typically have CS degrees and work in a variety of languages, but most of my back-end devs favor Java. Designers vary a lot these days, most have degrees in design, some have degrees in human factors. Product Managers usually have business, marketing, or CS degrees.

I know you're in the UK, but here in the US we're starting to see more ""bootcamps"" pop up that train people with job-specific skills in 6months or less. They tend to be private, for-profit, and expensive. And sometimes, the people coming out of them lack other skills that might be necessary for this kind of employment. But some of the people coming out of them are amazing, despite their new and crushing personal debt. This might be something to consider.

You're young, you seem like you're smart, so with enough work and experience, you can probably land anywhere you want in this chain, you just gotta know where you want. I just dumped a lot on you, so please feel free to hit me with questions.

Given that you are young perhaps college would be a good choice for you. It will give more in depth knowledge about design as a whole rather than the bare minimum you need to make somewhat okay apps and websites. A lot of people naysay the formal education in tech, but don't underestimate how much a diploma could come in handy down the line. With all the bootcamps popping up, some hiring managers are starting to blacklist bootcamps because they all have the same portfolio and skills. If you were a hiring manager would you rather see a cookie cutter bootcamp listed on a resume, or someone that showed dedication and a lust for knowledge by attending college?

Everyone will understand that you like to show your work. Firstly, I would suggest to simply ask people at the company about whether you would be able to include such work in your private! (non-public) portfolio.Further, replicate what you have done/learned at those companies, but put it into a personal project. The visuals are the simplest, the most tricky are specifics like overall layouts, structure etc that indicate ""this project at this company"". Additionally, in a public portfolio you may not want to show any ""secrets"" that the company does not want you to make public. I would say turn this into a conversation whenever you have the chance to do so (of course, granted that a former employer allows you to talk about it).

Kthulu666,"One of my favorites was a quick round of user testing. Of course this would be after they've been introduced to user testing and at least one method gathering insights from the data.

This works with 16 students but tweak the numbers and times to fit your class as needed. 

Split the gang up into groups of 4, give each team a different website that the student's aren't likely to be familiar with. 1 person to administer the test, 1 to take notes, 1 to observe their peers (note where they could've dug deeper into a user's response, that sort of thing) and the 4th goes around and participates in the other groups' tests. Rotate the roles so each person experiences everything. 

Test prep: 20 mins to check out the site, 20 mins to prepare a short user test, 15 mins per testing round. The rest of the class is gaining insights from the information they gathered. Of course 4 tests isn't statistically sound, but it's a good intro to user testing.

Maybe their homework is creating a semi-formal proposal that documents the process and suggests a course of action based on their insights. Maybe next class they present their findings/proposal, including what they had trouble with, so they can learn from eachother's tests and mistakes.",1534829182.0

Another one I've found fun and effective is the ""chinese whispers"" of visualization/experience definition.

* Get everyone to fold an A4 so there are five sections (or three, if you want a shorter version)
* Within a given time limit, in the first fold get the room write down an experience/problem/whatever you want (ensure they are hiding this from others in the room while writing and aren't telling people what they are writing about)
* Trade paper with someone else in the room, this person then looks at the description and draws it on the second fold. They then hide the original description so only the drawing is visible.
* Trade papers with someone else again, this person then has to describe what is drawn in the next fold. Hide the drawing and trade with another person.
* This person draws what they see etc.
* Trade again, write a final description.
* Everyone unfolds, sees the original description and what it devolved to.

Always good for a few laughs, most people can't draw or articulate what they're seeing effectively.

It's the same reason almost all successful campaigns don't rely on data. I would focus on an emotion or something that's just logical.

The only data I have found to be valuable for new sales is when they ask for things like button placement/color, or why things are fonted the way they are.

It's simple to just say that from our years of experience and A/B testing we simply see far greater results when what you want the customer to do just pops out - that way you make it easy for the customer to make the choice that you are most interested in them making.

I would focus on cognitive psychology while in school and see if they offer any human factors or engineering psychology courses. Also look into UX research if you're ever concerned about learning the design part.

Also, since you mentioned money being a worry when it comes to getting a PhD, if you want to pursue rigorous research, go for it. PhDs are paid, you don’t pay for them.

FunnyBunny1313,"I’m a UX designer, and my husband is a UX researcher. I have a BA in design and he has a Ph.D in human factors. At least in our area, if you want to do design, I would suggest doing a least a design masters after your psych degree, as there are some things fundamental thing about design thinking that are easier to learn in school. There is a lot more to UX design than just learning how to use sketch. I have worked with a lot of “designers” that did not have a strong design background - whether through experience or education - and it shows. While you can get it through experience, education can be a shortcut to getting a strong design background. 

If you are looking to do research, definitely look at either getting a masters or Ph.D. in something like human centered design or human factors. These are usually under psych programs so you are on the right course with your BA. In general (at least in the area I’m in), researchers tend to have high educations because they function more like scientists, whereas designers usually just have a BA in some kind of design, and a good portfolio and/or references. 

With that being said, there is a lot of overlap between the two, so don’t thing that once your make your decision that you will be locked into that career path the rest of your life. I know some researchers that do low-fidelity mock-ups, and I personally regularly participate in research at my company. 

Don’t do anything with code, or at least don’t advertise it on your resume. Any company that wants those skills in a UX person is just looking for a glorified front-end developer, and I have only ever seen one of those unicorns (kinda) exist. Those jobs usually don’t come from companies that truly value a UCD process.

But don’t take my word for it. The best thing your could possibly do is get as much out-of-the-classroom education you can. Almost no one is hiring people without experience, and the easiest way to get experience is through internships and part-time jobs while you are in college. I actually know several college friends who didn’t do internships or part-time jobs, and it has hurt them a lot since all “entry” jobs want experience. That has been the number one thing that has really helped both me and my husband get the jobs that we have now - both of us worked part-time In our fields or related fields the entire time we were in college. 

Last note - read a lot of books. I suggest “Design if everyday things” and “user story mapping” (just two of my favs)",1534740206.0

Dievalkyrie207,"I would say yes. I've seen a body of live user testing that's confirmed the need to articulate underlying system actions anytime the completion of those actions acts as a barrier to user progress. In other words, if a user uploads a file, clicks a ""Submit"" button, or otherwise triggers a system response that takes time before a user can take their next action.

When providing a sound indication of system status, don't forget these three aspects:

1. What's happening - assures users that the system is taking an action in accordance with their expectations.
2. What's the current level of progress - assures users that progress is being made, work is being done, and there's no need to exit or refresh a page to try again.
3. What was the result, once complete - provides either a satisfying confirmation that the operation is complete, or an error message that informs a user of what went wrong (in plain language), and what their next steps should be.

These items can be addressed in a number of ways, but it can boil down to something as simple as:

1. What's happening = text saying ""Uploading"" or similar.
2. Progress = ""spinner"" or progress bar, with a numerical figure(s) for percentage complete, percentage remaining, and/or time remaining.
3. Result = confirmation or error message.

CJP_UX,">Taking in to account ux

Lets break out the terms here. U = user, x = experience.  Are you really taking into account the *user*? You should likely test this with a few users. If you don't know who they are yet, take a guess, grab someone from a coffee shop, ask your sibling who doesn't know what your product is about. This is the bottom line way to engage in a UX process.

That said, heuristic thoughts, not real evidence:

>all with pictures and text

Why paragraphs of text? Could that information be set in a delineated/tabled format based on a its traits?

Do your users want the image to be 200% the size of the text? Or are they more concerned with details of the traits? Something to consider.

If you have those assumptions hammered out, the compact version seems obvious to me. Can you imagine trying to get to item #37 in a list that big? I'd be ctrl-ing F, but that's not a great experience for a new user. Filters of some kind may be helpful for a list of this size (name, coarseness, color retention, etc). 

You need to let users compare fabrics. Heavy scroll is poor, compact isn't great (but better). How can you let users compare things more easily? That is a good question to have.",1534423290.0

As for the data sets themselves, the left hand charts appear to bear the most relevance to the goals. If this is the case then give them pride of place, make it larger, perhaps it would work better as an area chart? Maybe the bar charts could be rotated 90 ACW and appear to 'hang' off the y axis. I don't know what the pie charts tell us that we can't get from the other data sets/could be overlaid onto other data sets.

In short it's about deciding what's important vs not important and how you convey this hierarchy. Furthermore, creating visual relationships between elements will enhance the page's hierarchy and aid comprehension.",1534349482.0
Koeque,"The thing I'm missing in the other replies is that you have to find out what you target group wants to achieve or learn by looking at these graphs. Also take some time to figure out what question is behind the question that you got from your boss/client. It will help you understand the context of the problem better. With this info it gets easier to think of other possibly better solutions. For instance you might find that the graphs are not even needed but a small written article is enough or that there is need for a easily shar3ble animation for social media, what ever.

I really can't just justice to the ideas on that book in one Reddit comment, but it's well worth the time and a very absorbing read.

* Understanding what story you are trying to tell

* Minimizing 'chart junk'

* Highlighting key areas of interest (based on user needs)

* Providing an 'honest' impression",1534358766.0
Kthulu666,"If this were a digital item (something on a web page) you could tinker with the idea of making a lot of those numbers visible on hover like tooltips. If you can eliminate some to clear the visual clutter, maybe just keep the lowest/highest.

If this is a prepared document like a pdf or image (I see it's in your gdrive so I assume it is, but maybe it's a screenshot idk) put your graphic design hat on.

I'd dedicate an entire page for each goal and the three graphs that pertain to it. This will allow a lot more whitespace and more room to redesign the graphs, add some visual hierarchy and hopefully make them a bit more legible.

Maybe you could include a short summary sentence describing the main takeaway of the graph e.g., ""the average number (YTD) of days of homelessness is still *19 days* above our goal,"" or ""the average days of homelessness went from **224** in 2017 Q1 to **282** in 2017 Q4.""

PSN_SMARTARDED,"There are some really simple things you can do to make the entire thing feel visually more digestable and approachable.

Limit your color palette. Right now all of the graphs use different palettes. Making them all shades of blue would lower the number of visual differences you see and make the entire page feel simpler.

Clean up all of the alignment. Some graphs bars start lower than others causing more visual differentiation and noise than necessary.

Soften the shapes. Even just adding slight rounded corners on the graph bars can make them feel softer and more approachable.

Select better typography. The current type feels like a default font, but not one that was intentionally selected to illicit a feeling of simplicity. A nice sans serif don't would make this feel even simpler visually.

Someone else mentioned hierarchy. Establish some rules that the viewer can depend on. Bold don't weights on all graphs mean x/y axis label. Thin font weight is for individual bar labels. White font on top of the bars indicate their individual values. Things like this teach the user where they can depend on being able to look for the information they need, and in the order you define as important.

Stuff like that is where id start with this. You could really quickly recreate this and I think get it to a place where it just intuitively feels easier to digest.",1534373232.0

currytonkatsu,"Seems like most of the heavy hitters have already been mentioned, so I'll chime in with **small anecdotal tips** I often overlooked when running sprints early on:

* **You're a ref, not a player**: I've facilitated sprints for both projects I was the designer for, and for some sprints as pure facilitator. In either situation, it's your best bet to influence the product of the sprint as little as possible. Be cognizant of your own bias towards particular solutions/paths, talk as little as possible
* **Get permission**: this was mentioned quickly in GV's Design Sprint, but after explaining what the sprint and what everyone's role is, get audible permission to be the facilitator. Good way to get the authority to move conversations along in a room with people who may be your organizational superior. Sounds weird, but it's a helpful psychological trigger.
* **Write the schedule on the board**: ideally with a visible clock nearby, it'll get everyone to help move conversations along together.
* **Document, document, document**: take as many progress photos as possible, not just the final results. Seeing the final, completely filled out, and nicely organized wall of sticky notes is beautiful, but seeing the small steps & changes to get there is way more helpful.
* **Use foamboards**: as an add-on to the top, if you have time/resources/storage space. Go to a nearby art store and get a few large foam boards (~$8-15) and put those up to put your sticky notes onto. Especially with grouping, it helps to preserve the work as a nice snapshot instead of having to take down each individual sticky note. Also depending on your office situation, it makes it easy to clear the room out at the end of the day if you can't keep it for the whole week.

ed_menac,">Sometimes, I have found myself redesigning the ideal experience to  account for edge-cases. This is a pitfall I am being wary of recently.  Changing the ideal happy path experience just to accommodate edge-cases  means some serious thinking needs to go behind system design — this to  me, highlights problems in how the system is engineered to work and  handle the one-offs. This is where designers have the opportunity to  challenge the status-quo of the system’s architecture.

This really speaks to me. My first designer job was also my first client-side job, so learning to deal wth the detail and the edge-cases of the design was the hardest lesson.

In the beginning, I wouldn't think of the edge cases at all. This led to frustration both for me and for devs when they were questioning the design and pelting it with 'what-ifs'.

Over time, I got better at pre-empting and accounting for the edge cases... but going a bit too far. The result being designs which were more complex than they needed to be, just to account for all factors.

Now I feel I've gotten to a stage where I can design a journey which works, and then handle the edge-cases on the fly. Experience (as an IXD, with the business, and with the users) helps me to decide what edge cases be dealt with, what can be disregarded, and what poses enough risk that it warrants its own journey.

“UI/UX programming” you mean “Front End Developer”, at least when referring to web development as opposed to native app development. Front end developers (ideally) work closely with UI/UX Designers to create the desired outcome. They are the developers that code the face of the application. HTML (the structure), CSS (the styling), and JavaScript (the functionality) are important skills for a front end developer.

So basically: start with researching for 1. User needs (in my opinion the most important) and 2. Businessgoals. 

Now start sketching ideas, wireframes or even write down what you want. Draw lines, connect the dots. Experiment.

Translate this into something testable. Ask your user how they feel about this idea. Let them click throughout a simple or more complex prototype. Could be build with PowerPoint as mentioned before.

LucidPolygon,"I believe that with a good understanding of what makes for good user experience in general, you can thrive in any department of the entertainment market. User Experience design is all about communication between your company, its products and its users; the better you communicate the better you'll understand your users, their problems and their needs. Understanding those needs will help you formulate better solutions and those solutions can always be improved further with continued feedback.

Legos are prime examples of one core value of what makes for good user experience: consistency. Legos are absolute marvels when it comes to consistency and engineering quality. The legos from decades ago will work with the legos of today and the legos decades into the future because of the importance they place in consistent quality control. In interview with a Lego engineer who explains that they have a precision tolerance of 0.002%. Absolutely mind boggling.

There are plenty of examples to be found with Nintendo as well, but going over even one of those could turn into its own essay so I won't since its easy to acknowledge how successful they are. That success certainly in part to their importance of the user experience.

How about No Man's Sky? Their initial failure in their product could certainly be attributed to their failure in transparency: another key fundamental in the user experience. When users found out that the game was nothing more than a bunch of empty promises, all hell broke lose. Miscommunication and their initial lack of communication entirely, intentional or not, resulted in it forever becoming immortalized as one of the biggest flops of all time. Look at them today though, they decided to not give up on their game, listen to their community and use that feedback to improve their game and attempt to rectify those mistakes. The damage is done, but the game's overall reviews today are a stark contrast to what they once were.

I could go on and on with more examples, but I know you can too. Communicate with your users by practicing key user experience fundamentals and you'll speak to them for the better.

I trained as a graphic designer and have been doing the job for about 7 years, but have transitioned into a more UX focussed role in the last few years, whilst also handling web/UI design and development. 

Having a solid background in computer science would be a better choice in my mind. Honestly, there isn't much money in graphic design for the majority of people working in the industry, and most designers I know did a graphic design degree, then learnt interface/web design on the job or through the studio that employs them. It's what I did.

Most design studios here don't even require you to have a degree in order to work for them, they're more interested in your portfolio and experience. There's also a lot of competition for jobs, and the jobs that do get posted are now expecting additional skills like web development. A CS degree would likely open many more doors for you in future, and much faster than a graphic design degree would.",1533893687.0

They're two distinct roles, though often filled by the same person in smaller companies, which is why you see a lot of job postings for ""UX/UI"".

Look at the courses offered in each degree track and compare them. Without having seen them I could only guess as to what they are, but I'm sure you'll notice some major differences between computer science and interactive design.

The content you're studying should probably take precedence over how nice the school seems to be. By the time you get the degree you'll have spent years studying it. You probably want to end up with a degree in something you're interested in.",1533811690.0
rebeltrillionaire,"I think if you can code do it. The skills to practice UI on your own aren’t difficult. Buy a couple sketch books, read some good design books, learn to wireframe, buy a license to Sketch, copy some designs. 

Wireframe, then prototype, then develop a very small app from start to finish. 

Did you forget some screens going from wireframe to prototype? Did you forget screens prototype to Code? Figure out why you forgot those.

Now go get feedback on your app, hand it over blindly see if anyone can use it. Poll people digitally with some randomization. 

Just remember, when you start out, don’t worry about reinventing the wheel. Just nail the fundamentals. Whatever your choose, more engineering or more design/UX, fundamentals are key and choosing isn’t a final verdict. You can crossover whenever in your life.

A good question to ask yourself is if you're actually clear on the goals and objectives of your research and if you know exactly what questions you want to answer. If these points aren't well planned out, one can often jump around and not get any conclusive data, or sometimes it's quite conclusive that you're not solving anything for them, but I'm assuming that's not the situation.

I don't know how you've been conducting the research, but I would suggest breaking into parts rather than trying to get all the answers to everything all at once.

If you already have working prototypes to present to users, think about the user stories that make sense for the user you're  targeting and their needs and habits. Then I would suggest laying out tasks that those users would look to complete on your application. By asking users to complete these tasks, you can understand if it's easy to achieve and logical from a user's point of view and how closely it fits with their mental model.

In terms of running the tests in their environment/context, that's never an easy one to achieve without some equipment, but even if you have a second phone and ask the user if you can record their interaction with another phone. Even when there is no budget, make a plan. Nowdays there are quite a few ways of having a lo-fi solution.

In some pod settings, you're the only designer or are handling both UX and UI, which makes you ""lead"" by default. But you might not actually be leading anything, per se. Find that out. If you're going to be guiding a process or people, the interviewer may need to know that you have a strong voice, can carry out a vision, are a good communicator, and can be a good leader. If you're not leading a group or people, you'll need to be autonomous, not need a ton of guidance, and be pleasant to work with.

halcylon,"I'll be honest, that question is super dependent on the company and you - each team dynamic is different, each environment unique - and the quicker you realize that simply by asking this question raises concern about whether this is the right time for a lead level role. But this interview will be a good experience none-the-less. 

*Leading a Design* is not the same as *Leading a UX Team*. 

In my experience...

... Lead usually means no *individual contributor* work. It means organizing team(s), setting up new processes (or updating old ones), aligning goals and values, and keeping track of tasks and work. This seldom means decision making and creating new ideas. It means using teams to accomplish goals, not individual contributions.

I would strongly focus away from 'being the decision maker' and lean on ""through my career I've learn these values"" and how they have help you and how you've changed and pivoted from old assumptions and learned paradigms. 

I know, I'm an asshole for the ""might not be the right time"", but you have to accept that as a potential possibility. Most companies that are hiring a Lead level are looking for someone who is already (or has been) in that role. I know it seems counter intuitive, but getting to that level usually doesn't come from jumping from company to company. 

Again, I just want to set expectations because I wish someone had told me this 9 years ago when I was for some pretty good interviews that I tanked because I was promoting my intuition and design skills. ",1533765241.0

ux-dude,"Unsure how valuable this feedback will be because companies operate differently and not all leads are equal in role or responsibility.

curiouspaws,"I don't know what counts as ""a lot"", but it is becoming more common. In fact, more and more companies in SF Bay Area are looking to hire remote designers since the cost of living in the Bay Area is too high.

I have been working remotely for a few months now. The biggest pro is being able to crank out work without distractions. Another pro of being remote is that I get to easily do user testing in a different location from the rest of the company and get out of the ""bubble"" a bit. Seeing users in their natural habitat hasn't been an issue since our product isn't location-dependent.

As far as downsides, there are many. You can't spontaneously bounce ideas off other designers / team members or brainstorm something together. You also need to be more deliberate about seeking opportunities to network with and learn from other designers / people in the same industry, since you won't be sitting next to a team everyday. Longer term, I think being remote may limit the scope / responsibility of your role, and thus making it harder to be promoted to the next level.

While I enjoy the freedom of working remotely as a UX designer, I do see myself going back to an office environment at some point. An ideal alternative I think is having the option to work remotely for a few weeks or months a year.",1533769206.0

The thing is, as a UX designer who would love to work remotely, I don't know how it's truly possible. You don't get to view your user in a natural habitat, you don't get to connect with users, stakeholders, or coworkers in a more natural, conversational way (IMO) and overall the observation of UX can be so lost in translation.

As someone who would love her own office and to work remote where I don't have to be around people, I'm not totally feeling UX is the place for that. I've had to adapt to that knowledge rather than make UX adapt to my feelings about it. And in truth, that is probably a good thing.",1533762063.0

Taxed_,"I've been in Service Design for about 10 years now. What would you like to know? I'm not US based, but I'll assume you are.

Typical employers (in order of amount of jobs) are Government (often larger teams of 10-40), Consulting firms (Big 4 etc.) and Agencies (sometimes they'll call themselves a ""Strategic Design agency/consultancy"").

Most countries have a bunch of ""Innovation lab"" type agencies which have multiple service designers, I know in the US there's 18F - https://18f.gsa.gov/. They even wrote a blog post about how they recruit employees - https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/08/02/ask-18f-talent/. They mention ""slack channels"" as one of their means of referral - I know Designer's Hangout is one of them, you should join - https://www.designerhangout.co/ (You'll have to link them your LinkedIn, but don't worry they're not strict on you being in UX already).

You also might consider attending a service design network event if there's a chapter in your city - https://www.service-design-network.org/chapters. While these events are for people involved in service design, if you're able to hold a conversation it no one is going to mind - you could email the organiser to make sure its okay first.

If I were you I'd just apply for roles as they appear - do your research, understand their requirements, show them your customer focus and passion for Service Design. 90% of people in this field don't have a degree in ""Service Design"", we all came from related fields at some stage in our career.

Took me 5 months of applying everyday probably over 100+ jobs to land my first UX/Product Design Position. 
In the meantime I took jobs on upwork to build my portfolio and have some real life client work to talk about in my interviews.

edit: also as others have said, be sure you know what UX is. photoshop/illustrator aren't really any part of it (Sketch is what a lot of people use) and in addition to being a designer you are a researcher.

brizardi,"I completely agree with the sentiment of ""data-informed design,"" however I will say that some of your examples just sound like metrics that are based too directly off of business goals instead of the leading indicators and narrowly focusing on one metric at a time vs a few. I can see why the temptation to do this would be pretty large in game design and other industries where the the business result of the design is so immediate (e.g. did we sell more yesterday vs today) and the user isn't there for much more than to be entertained.

In products that are more ""task"" based and where there is a larger time lag between product change -> business results the metrics usually end up being a little more reliable. E.g. a company like Uber can say ""we want to decrease wait times while keeping driver rating steady"" - which is pretty solid. In my industry, healthcare, we can say ""we want nurses to administer medications with less than X% error rate while providing positive survey results on the workflow."" As long as we aren't saying ""screw every other user and part of the product"" there isn't much in those that would lead us astray.",1533511774.0

bofstein,"That's a tough question - there is literally an entire discipline (Survey Science/Methodology) on how to make valid surveys you could get a PhD in, so it's not something that can be anwerered in a Reddit comment. You're best bet is to do some quick reading on SPECIFIC topics or questions you want to ask and see if there are validated measures for those. 

One quick piece of advice for the one you mentioned - it will be hard for pepllle to answer such a broad question of how much health is important to them. Most people care about being alive and healthy - you'll want to he specific about whether you mean eating healthy, going to the doctor, etc. And even then, what one person says is ""moderately important"" to them won't always be the same as when another person gives the same response, depending on how they view the scale.

One option for what I'm guessing you're trying to get at for recipes is to ask people to compare two options at a time (since ranking multiple options is a lot of cognitive work). You could ask things like When choosing a recipe to cook at home, which is generally MORE important to you: eating healthy or having full flavor? Cooking faster or having more complex dishes? Using fewer ingredients or using up the most of what you have?

You can mix up the options too and end up with a ranking of what factors they care about without asking them to rank all the factors. And then you could use that to help match recipes.",1533226997.0

Going back to the survey, rather than asking things like ""would you like this"" or ""do you use this"" I would frame it as:
How likely would you be to use this (with a scale)

I mentioned general usability because page load times are worth looking at. Throwing a framework at something that could be achieved with just some js can cause lag, jitters in loading, and can impact users with limited data a much greater extent.

We have our UX in 2 groups... 1 group that does bigger UX projects, e.g deep dive research and new big, complex systems that need more than screen by screen design. 

The second group is imbedded with the developers in the scrum teams and does design in the same sprint that development happens. This is whiteboarding with developers, grab people in the hall for feedback and go to full prototype in a day or two. The whiteboarding lets the developers start work even if they have to make adjustments for final design. 

What we’re missing is a good connection between the two groups... the community of practice the presenter mentions. 

I’m also interested in how we can get the UX input in a more meaningful way at story creation. The product team does well, but UX could really help. ",1533102761.0

About asking users for feedback. It think it's ok. If executed in proper way you can get a lot of valuable feedback before launch. You can get insights on cultural association (especially logos), or how easy it's to associate your brand and content with new design.

It also can serve as a way to slowly introduce the design to the userbase. I noticed that when you make an overhaul the users are not happy. If you announce the changes and present them gradually users have easier time to get used to it.

About asking users to design logo and overall brand. I have multiple issues here. For a company, it's just unprofessional. It looks bad to ask something like that.

Personally, when  I'm approached by recruiters it's  usually through LinkedIn. 

Above all, I appreciate honesty, detail and (if possible) a small indicator that you've at least checked to see if I'm a fit.

**Honesty**

Please be upfront about the type of work I'd be expected to do. Not knowing what 'flavour' of UX the company is after is my main anxiety when prospecting a job, and the number one reason why I am likely to ignore a message. 

There's so much variety within UX. If a recruiter doesn't explain what's expected, I assume the worst: either the company is a UX imposter, or the recruiter doesn't understand what UX really means and therefore can't articulate it.

**Detail**

Along with the above, if I have to ask for more detail, I'm on the back foot. My experience with recruiters is that they can be quite forceful. I would be worried I would get cajoled into an interview for a job that's not right, or which turns out to be a dud. 

Attractive features of a job for UXers include the company ethos, the makeup of the team, type of development, and a rough idea of the type of product they'd be working on.

Location, salary, and benefits are all important, but the above details often get left out.

**Personalisation**

I get that if you're digging through a huge pile of leads, this becomes tedious. But I really appreciate when I get a personal message from a recruiter, rather than a copy paste block of text.

My LinkedIn is very candid and detailed, so I'm grateful when a recruiter mentions *why* they think I'm a good fit. 

Is it a skill I have which the company would be interested in? Is it the work in a particular sector which would stand out? Or simply my level of seniority which would fit the right experience level for the job?

The best way to get my attention is to go through a connection, preferably someone I've worked with before. Also, tell me not just what skills the roles requires, but what I'll get out of it besides a salary. What does success for this role look like (eg, launch a new product line in six months)?

oddible,"A correction because it is frustrating to hear people perpetuate the misnomer that ""experience trumps degrees"" as if you don't get any experience in an academic program.  Especially in a research based Master's you will be up to your ears in research study design, running a variety of studies, publishing your stats against a jury of hard hitting critics, working with industry partnerships on studies in actual HUGE companies with enormous grants and teams of scientists.  Anyone who says that crap about experience trumping a degree went to a shitty school that didn't have all that.  The Columbia and NYU programs rock.  Pratt will be less focused on where you're headed in quant.  If you like academics, and especially if you can get funding, go do your Master's now - its great fun and you WILL expand your knowledge of methods and improve your study design in a supportive environment where you'll get great feedback from excellent mentors on your research capability - you won't always get that in industry - in fact it is the biggest thing missing from industry, finding good mentors in UX. Make sure not to get stuck in TA roles, get RA roles to really take advantage of the program and pick up internships along the way.  Publish, publish, publish, it really helps getting the feedback and presenting your work.  The degree is a piece of paper, no one cares about that, but people who have gotten their Master's are more articulate, understand study design better, have a wider toolkit, and get amazingly wide industry connections through their cohort as everyone goes off to work at the best companies doing the most amazing stuff!",1532929979.0
dudeweresmyvan,"We seem to have some overlap in our background/experience.  


Usually the goal is to get a job as a ux reseacher. And then have a job pay for more education.

I've been looking into more quant and have been revisiting books by sauro, tullis, and albert. I have also taken community college courses to brush up on my statistics as well as take care of any pre-reqs that I may need for a second ms/ma degree in either applied stats or data science.  


There's very active subs with georgia tech's data science ms program that's only $10k and online. There's also an active sub statistics that offers advice for schools/professional goals.  


There are few jobs in quant uxr - and fewer advertised as having less than 5 years exp.",1532948275.0
ed_menac,">I never got a formal Stats education...I want to be able to have a more formal toolkit of  quantitative study design and data analysis methods to draw from, not  just by reading books. 

I understand what you're saying, and if you were entering into market intelligence or data science that'd make sense. For UX, quant is rarely relevant, beyond some general statistical understanding, for which you don't need a master's degree.

>I also am young and think now's the time to  continue with school

Arguably when you're young it's better to get some work experience under your belt before you enrol in a costly education program. Take some time to gain experience and figure out whether you really need more education. Education will always be there if you need it.

>am concerned about finding a job out of school again 

This is the main risk, as well as the financial cost of tuition and living while you aren't earning.

>Have you done quantitative UX research work?

Yes and no. It's something I was tasked with when I worked in a research agency, however it never got off the ground. Quant work ultimately doesn't provide much return on investment for the time and effort to gather and analyse data. Again, I'm talking only in UX terms here. UX is so fragile - minute changes in the UI can vastly affect how people interact and understand it. There's so much variance, and it requires solid metrics of success (which UX rarely has). There are piles and piles of books dedicated to figuring out 'how to measure UX', but the bottom line is that on a large scale, it becomes harder to pinpoint.

The only figures we reliably used in our research was simple counts - ""X users missed the CTA"". That's not quant, it's just qual with some numbers chucked in for context.

>Do  you have experience with any of the programs I've listed or similar  ones? If so, what has your experience and trajectory been like? Which programs do you think would be most relevant from an employer's  perspective to get another job in UX research?  
>  
>Do you think a masters program is worth it, debt aside?

I know a couple of people who have done statistics masters degrees, but none of whom have gone on to use it in their career (or to enter UX). Even HCI courses, which are much more common amongst UX professionals seem to serve more as footholds to get into the job market. Once they're in the field, there's not a distinct advantage of an academic background compared to experience through the workplace or self-taught theory.

>What  are the alum networks like across the schools, particularly in terms of  these programs? Especially in terms of networking for jobs or  internships

Alum networks are great... apart from that you are going to be in direct competition with your peers for the same graduate jobs. There are many other ways to build networks through interest meetups, conferences and through the workplace.

\---

I feel like all I've done is come in and piss on your bonfire - sorry about that! I just wanted to provide a flip side of the argument. It sounds like you're pretty set on doing your masters. But if that's what you're interested in, then perhaps it's UX which isn't right for you? As I said, quantitative research is a skill in demand in other fields, but as for UX, it's really not appropriate. ",1532924501.0
Riimii,You’re honestly better off going on LinkedIn and finding people who are currently enrolled in or who have completed these programs. It is unlikely that many people who are in this sub have graduated from those programs.,1532913257.0
Mr_Te_ah_tim_eh,"I've been working as a UX researcher and designer for about 7 years now - here are some of my thoughts and experiences:

**The Learnin'**

I got my MIS degree six years ago, and it has served me well. I went to the School of Information at UT, which had a great selection of classes that provided exposure to a multitude of quantitative and qualitative research practices, statistics for research, usability research/testing, HCI, information architecture, design, prototyping, and more.

**The Network**

For me, one of the best aspects was the network that I established before leaving school. My professors had sway in the industry and introduced me to a bunch of job prospects (I got a full-time internship before I even graduated, and am still working at that company).

**The Job Opps**

As for actually landing a quantitative research gig...that can be more difficult. A job with true quant is kind of the elusive unicorn of UX research jobs, in my experience. A lot of my friends have had to move from one city to another in order to chase those rare opportunities — the ones who get hired for those positions have all had master's degrees or PhDs.

While finding a job that will truly let you do quantitative research can be difficult, many hiring managers THINK they want quantitative (until they realize how expensive it is to do statistically significant research) and will hire based on wanting someone who **can** do quant.

Side Note: the number of times I've presented research findings from a pool of something like 5 users to a client stakeholder, only to have them try to get me to report that ""80% of users were able to successfully *yadda yadda yadda,""* is sad.

**The Pay**

Unfortunately, salary caps based on education are still pretty common in UX jobs. Advanced degrees/certifications can help put you into the next pay bracket...even if your degree isn't relevant to the job you perform. I've had many smart and talented friends who have been frustrated by hitting a pay ceiling early in their careers, especially if they want to advance to managerial or director-type roles.

—————

Anyway, that's just my personal experience - I second the idea of u/Riimii to stalk some LinkedIn peeps who attend or have graduated the schools you're interested in — good luck!",1532924611.0
stairapprentice,"Honestly? None of those universities are very well known for programming or UX. NYU is exorbitantly expensive — not sure why you would want to bury yourself in debt.

Ideally, for a masters, you get funding. I say, follow the funding and the professors. It's based around your thesis and your supervisor. Find professors you want to work under and chase them, not schools. 

What degrees do your dream jobs ask for? Google, for example, looks for PhDs in human-computer interaction for some UX researcher jobs. ",1532923247.0

User Google Scholar to find an established group (or three!) of academics studying the psychology/sociology/human factors/ergonomics behind what you need to know and start following them by using Google Scholar alerts. Over time, you will build out a set of references that work well for the suite of products that you are working on. There's no good ""single source"" for this knowledge because the breadth of knowledge is to big and needs to be customized to the UX challenges that you are facing.

jjshoob,"Website management, catalogue, social media, branding, and emarketing actually sound more along the lines of a Director of Marketing - at least at a smaller company. Someone does all this at my company and she is actually big into the analytics of things as well. So structuring our Google Analytics, and keeping tabs on our Adwords campaigns etc. etc. Making sure our tracking works across our channels and trying to boost conversions rates on our webpages. As well as leading the charge on 1 or 2 PR campaigns at a time.

I think if you learn some about analytics, and throw in some research skills you should be good to transition to a UX Design position. Knowing what your users click on, what they think about the website, and knowing your users really well are all part of becoming great at UX. 

Is there opportunity in this position to create mockups and iterate on new features and user test? Or do you build everything so quick you skip the research and planning phases and let websites sit for months without iterating?

clarkinum,"Depends, if you want long attention on one item then swipe, but that could be boring for the user if content is not interesting, if you just want people to browse then it's scroll",1532531909.0
incredibleRoach,"Scrolling is continuous, while swiping tends to be in discrete steps. So it depends on what your content requires. If it's slides someone is viewing, scrolling can be annoying because you may end up stopping halfway between two slides - and this is a problem because slides are discrete, but if it's paragraphs of text, fluid scrolling is great but moving in discrete steps would make you lose which line you were on as the screen would tend to ""jump"". If paired with the wrong content, swiping could definitely increase cognitive load. 

In terms of motor load, both are probably the same, with swiping perhaps a little more taxing only because of the length of the gesture sometimes needing to be longer to ensure it is detected correctly by the device.

Scrolling is definitely faster if you are trying to skip through lots of content to get to something further down without paying close attention to what is passing by because of the way mobile interactions are set up. We don't usually have quick scrolling sideways as an alternative to swiping, so trying to get to something deep in a list of things becomes harder with swiping.

Lastly, it may be easier for a user to recollect approximately how far down on a page something is than it is to remember where a particular slide was in a sequence of slides you swipe through, probably because the concept of ""distance"" is more natural than that of counting.",1532546597.0
helpfulFrenchBulldog,"Depends on the user's intent. Scrolling content encourages discoverability, browsing, and skimming in order to find the content that attracts them. Less time on each potential click to find the one that they want to click on. 

Seems like it would work for dating right? Swiping seems to work better because it forces the user to make an active decision via gesture. Unlike scrolling through irrelevant content, swiping through profiles provides a ""First impression"" experience where consideration is actively garnered. 

Sometimes ""Easier"" is not the goal of a UI/UX pattern. Always important to consider the goal of the UI/UX before anything. ",1532660876.0

digitecca,"This is user experience, focus being on the user and factors that affect them. Content type would certainly be a large influence on this, but users are all different and prefer different things. Your user base may generally find your app easier to use with one or the other, but it's hard to know without some quantitative research in apps similar to your own. You can then choose to disrupt, or break the common pattern, or to try the path of least resistance and use what has been metered to work. Lately there has been a new movement bringing up the benefits of a place-ona. If your app is a recipe app and someone has their hands in uncooked chicken, obviously the path of least resistance is voice control. Similarly, we'd need to examine if there are any scenarios in which swiping left or right is easier than up or down.

dudeweresmyvan,"Good question. I would guess that scrolling would be perceived as easier because more content can typically move faster through the viewport vertically compared to swiping.

The tough thing about your user base is that they're (a) a minority group that deals with oppression and bullshit a lot and (b) you're asking about sensitive aspects of their lives. This combo means it could be hard to approach them appropriately.

Messaging random numbers on the app is probably a bad idea, as you might appear to just be a 'bear', so to speak (it's fine if you are, but your role here is as a researcher). 

You could try a few different things to get responses from people. First, create a screener survey. Then find out where to send it. You could put an add on facebook, twitter, or Growlr specifically. You could send tweets at public twitter accounts that mention the app. You could go to other subreddits here where bears may hang out (message the mods first) and put out a post calling for participants.

This can even be done remotely - look ""remote moderated usability test"" up (moderated means that you - the observer - will moderate the session). If you want to collect feedback and user insights beyond usability, better to do a qualitative study in which you i) directly interview users about their usage of the app, their expectations, pain points etc... (if you do this collecting insights from as little as 5 users should be enough to give you some things to think about for your redesign)  or ii) write up a well-thought online survey and send it to as many users as possible (you will need lots of responses for this in order to be valuable).",1532528323.0

This might be scattered but I think you'll be able to follow. Where the dev team is located counts. If they're in the same building and you can regularly get up and talk with them awesome. If the team is located off-site then it will be a little harder. At the start of any big coding project. Have a kick-off meeting, have the PM and the dev lead or dev that will be doing the work there. They'll be clued in and will have some thoughts on how things might want to get done. Also, get with the devs and find out what they're coding in and what they would like to code in. The reason being, a dev that HAS to code in a specific language because that's the way it's always been. Is eager to try something new and will be excited if you bring and/or include them in that.

See if there is UX buy-in from the top down. If not, you're going to be pushing a 1tn. UX boulder up hill. At some point you'll get squashed. It's your job to look at the entire project and what's needed to pull it off. It's your teams job with your direction to push the company and/or it's products to new heights. Be bold and drive innovation from within.

You're also going to have to defend your team and their work. Pick your battles. In some cases you'll need to cave in, others fall on your sword. Learn to sell, it really helps to be able to get people on your side. Also, learn how to push back, even with a C-level exec.

Honestly, you can read a ton on how to manage people, projects a team etc. Yet, nothing will be as effective as just going through it and coming out the other side in the end. I've got 25 years in UX and am a VP with a team of 8 to be 12 be the end of the year. Our avg. project size is roughly $500K+.

Its been a trend these days to give design assignments prior to hiring design applicants, even though the design applicant is providing a portfolio list of past works that is enough to judge his/her thinking process. Most of the times such assignments are misused to collect ideas for the project in action. We call it Fakethons. A Design homework that obviously have no scope for actual User Research and Usability Testing until hired based on one's opinion is not justifiable. Designers and UX are not idea generation machines. Idea Generation is a Team Work achieved by Design Thinking, Stakeholder Discussions, User Interviews and many other such exercises. Designers, Design Coaches, Design Mentors, UX Strategist are mere facilitators in such exercises. Over the last decade the field of designing has institutionalized. They follow systematic Data Driven methodologies. Such practices and expectation from UX and Designers is harming the collective fidelity of the eco-system of recruitment, hiring, product development, corporate and startup. This knowledge must be an integral part of Design Education. This forum is an initiative to discuss such experiences. ",1532865017.0

* Network your ass off

If you are specifically interested in research, this might be helpful:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1421QZTSKCO2W6hMMy8boA0ziDz1IgWzItG6_i3kR8z8/edit#heading=h.f551ljpof8b6",1532421783.0
Ginmau,"This is just my opinion, but from my experience, the formal training you have in anthropology is actually a great baseline as UX is about understanding people, their needs and frustrations.

The things I would suggest investing in is practical research in the sense of, if you only had 1 week to do the research, you still need to produce results, whearas in academic research, it's usually more detailed and has a longer timelines.

The other part that I would look to develop would be practical ideation/conceptualisation. Taking the insights obtained from research and creating something that answers those needs and solves this problems.

In terms of your knowledge with photoshop, only if you want to design the interfaces and visuals and there I might suggest investing in learning sketch. But if you just want a way to present rough examples of your concepts, a simple tool like balsamiq should be good enough.

As far as coding skills, they can help you communicate with developers, so knowing something is good, but you don't generally need to be able to put the things together yourself.

I would suggest reading some books and attending workshops catered to specific subjects if possible. However if you feel you need to fill in too many gaps, than a bootcamp on top of your formal training usually has great results.

No matter what platform you choose, whether it be a site builder or you build it from scratch, make sure to spend time thinking about and designing and the experience of your site.

What do you ultimately want people to do? Look at your projects? Look at your resume? Learn more about you?

While building a simple static site is a worthwhile and satisfying learning exercise, I don't much care what your portfolio is hosted on. I strongly suspect some of the best porfolios I saw recently were Wix or Squarespace, but I never bothered to find out. (I've noticed more portfolio sites going dark as soon as people get offers, which makes me think they're paying more than hosting costs) I would avoid anything that's particularly branded though, and get a non-ridiculous domain name.  

I had a standalone site for years - Wordpress for a long time, then Jekyll on Github Pages. Github quit building the site for reasons I could not determine - no error messages make debugging harder - so I pulled it down rather than have old information. My current portfolio is a Google Slides deck, which is easy to replicate and modify to suit the folks I'm talking to at the moment. I got hired off that deck. 

Whatever you DO put it out, it needs to be current and error free. Even relatively minor errors - a broken link, a Lorem Ipsum caption - look pretty bad. In my mind this an arguement away from building it from scratch -- lower the complexity and overachieve on execution. ",1532212227.0

I've been working as a team of one for a little over a year as well, and in that time the biggest and by far the most valuable thing I've done has been to build a user research process from the ground up. Not only is it something that really needs to be being done, but it will give you a lot of insight into ways you can help evolve your products over time. Directions to take them that may otherwise have gone overlooked. 

If you have users, recruit them directly. Incentivize their participation in user interviews, surveys, usability testing sessions, and all kinds of other methodologies that may be helpful. If you don't have users, put together personas based on who your target users might be and recruit people to participate locally or online. 

Are your products accessible? If not, that's a great thing to strive for not only from an ethical standpoint but from a legal one as well. Most of it is pretty easily achieved as well like making sure text has an acceptable contrast ratio with its background and ensuring that the developers you work with are labeling components in ways that are easily understandable for somebody using a screen reader.

What's on the business roadmap? Where do you think the product is in comparison with where stakeholders want it to be and where they want it to be going? Start figuring out how you can best contribute to that. What features are missing? What information about use cases and users do you need to know? How will you get it?

Given the nature of startups there's almost certainly more that would be good to do than you have time to do. But starting to answer these questions and questions like them is how you build yourself a personal roadmap as well as a design roadmap for your company in a wider sense. ",1532147969.0

Right now you're in a somewhat precarious position, because the company is understaffed in UX. 

Best thing to do is to have a real talk with your CEO. You either need someone seasoned to build out a team or your CEO needs to go out and find a UX specialist agency to build out a design system and set up the metrics and user testing. 

At minimum you need a UX lead/director, UX researcher / analytics person and a UX designer. The number one thing to focus on is to build out a mature and efficient research practice. Most big UX/product wins come from just watching people use your product and fixing broken pathways and confusing language.

Get your team to agree on the outcomes they want for the business and the user (KPIs). Don't give them ideas - facilitate the conversation.

Build a prototype with them, and perform user tests designed to measure the riskiest assumptions. Example: ""the business will fail if users don't want this feature"". 

Bring the results of the test to the team, and help them decide what you should do next. Repeat this process until you're all happy.

I don’t think the PhDs did them any good professionally and may have even hurt them. Made them seem to academic / increase pay expectations. UX is a field of practice. It requires experience in delivering design in a business context. Education is great, but it can only teach so much - so there’s a ceiling to how much is useful. One of the PhDs was probably more useful (and it was the psych one) because she was in user research. But still, it was unnecessary. That’s no reason not to do it, there may be other reasons you want one, but it’s not the best path to UX. If you do, think about what part of UX you want to do.

Inevitably screens will be a part of everyone’s life but how well do they integrate into actual work settings.

ThatNeonZebraAgain,"Anthropology PhD here that does both UX research and design.

Psychology is a pretty academic common path to UX, but the vast majority of social science programs rarely equip you with the specific skills or resume experience to get a job that involves any *design* work. You will develop a great skillset for the research process, writing, public speaking, using data to make insights and defending those insights, peer review/critique, quickly learning new things, working on many kinds of things in parallel, and systematic problem-solving, but unless you go to a program that specializes in applying research to design, you would have to supplement your PhD work with courses/activities outside your program/department. This is totally doable though (it's what I did), it just takes more work on your part to actively seek out opportunities (both inside and outside the classroom) and make the connections to get that experience.

Despite what others here are saying, a PhD is more of a double-edged sword than a strict liability in UX. You might get passed over for positions that are more entry-level, design-heavy, or with companies that are smaller or UX immature. There are also some stereotypes people have about how PhDs think and work: they are only good for research-related work, their explanations of things tend to be dry/boring and long-winded, prone to getting too deep or in the weeds about things, and so on. Some of this comes from graduate training, which still predominately prepares people for academic careers, but nonetheless these common perceptions mean you will have some unique challenges in how you craft your resume, portfolio, interview responses, deliverables, etc. That said, having a PhD can also open doors for you, especially at larger or more specialized companies (and government agencies), and for dedicated research positions (which are becoming much more common) or some senior positions. Salary usually [higher than people without them](https://uxpa.org/article/2016-ux-salary-survey-results), but whether it beats having equivalent years of experience in industry [is another question](https://measuringu.com/usability-phd/). The hardest part is making the transition from grad school to industry, but once you get established with some years of solid industry experience having those extra 3 letters on your resume can be an advantage.

I would only recommend getting a PhD if you can do it without taking on ANY (or at least very little) debt. Assistantships, fellowships, grants, work-study, and other funded positions not only pay for your tuition, but also give you a living stipend and additional experience. [Here's a link with some other good things to consider](https://www.userzoom.com/ux-careers/should-uxers-get-a-phd/).  Is a PhD for everyone or necessary to get into UX? Definitely not. Could a Master's open many of the same doors? Yes. 

In terms of area of study, I'd agree /u/ladyperceptive that [human factors psychology](https://www.apa.org/action/science/human-factors/education-training.aspx) would be most relevant. That said, the particular program can matter more than the explicit field of study; a social psych program with a more applied focus and faculty might yield more interesting and relevant experience than a different one doing human factors. The program/department itself will have a big impact how easy a transition would be to industry, so it is important to do your homework when picking where to apply. Either way, since a social science PhD is research-focused, if you want to do design work you will still need to get some good design experience, whether directly from your grad program or through a different department at the university.",1532200407.0

chimichurri73,"I have a BA in Psychology, as well. When I was starting out, I was limited to learning in my spare time at work, so I spent a ton of time reading articles on UX-related websites (uxmatters, Boxes and Arrows, Neilsen-Norman Group, User Interface Engineering, etc). These sites are good because you can learn about what trends and fads are happening in the field, as well as get ideas on books and topics you want to explore more. I ended up focusing on Information/UX Architecture and User Research, and less on design and coding as a result on this.

I read a ton of books, as well. There are some classics to definitely check out depending on your interest area.

It's also good to learn about different project methodologies like Agile, Lean UX, and old school waterfall.

Sketch is a good tool to learn nowadays for screen design.. That's what we use at my current job. The added benefit is that both UX and visual designers can work together on the same file more easily. However, it isn't ideal for doing things like complicated site maps or flows.

8 years ago the problem in job hunting in UX was that there were hardly any jobs to be found.

These days...you find quite a lot of UX jobs listed. But read the description and it can become clear what they really want is a graphic designer.

Sometimes it is less clear from the start and isn't revealed until halfway through the interview.

I have nothing against graphic designers. They have a very valid skill set which I'd love to posses. But...That isn't UX Design. It's a different job.

It seems in many ways that though UX is a lot more mature and recognised than when I started.... it is still all too often recognised as something completely different- and painfully so.

jonkerr95,"Hey OP, just my two cents here;

tldr; An internship to gain professional work experience, is more valuable then missing a term of school in the long run. I went to a university where, instead of 4 years you finish in 5 but have 5 internships under your belt; making you more competitive than someone who just did their undergrad. It also provides you income while studying and also nice to have that cash money $$$. It comes down to work ethic and your portfolio: work hard, design smart, for that \~ *a e s t h e t i c* \~ show your thought process and logic. It doesn't matter if the company gives you ""bad"" work, you can always do 'value added' projects and present them to your manager to better your skills. Theory and practice is key. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Just for some context, I went to University of Waterloo (Canadian school) for my undergrad and a large component of the school is co-op/internships. Alot of companies in silicon valley hire the CS and Software Eng's from the school which gets them in the door later on in life, same with other designers and UX students in their respective programs. I myself am doing a masters in UX design and information systems design and the University of Toronto, which offers co-op as well, and think that it is a good foot in the door to have some experience under your belt. After school, you're grades don't really matter to employers unless they specifically ask for your gpa (interns, junior hires etc.) and to some degree the theory isn't as relevant as having applicable in field knowledge / experience.

\*\*I'm assuming you're already in University, otherwise you are finishing high school, and delaying your entrance into university? You haven't specified so I'm just assuming\*\* (If you're just finishing high school then take the rest of the post however you may), as I personally think that; unless you are a seriously phenomenal designer who took on a lot of projects in their spare time, companies won't really look at you as an intern as they require you to return to university the following summer/spring/winter whatever afterwards. That, and competition from people who are in university who have both academic experience and portfolio experience.

What I learned over the time of my undergrad completing different internships is that; its about the work you put in while you're in the office (or if you're lucky enough to work for a company that allows remote office), and even if you are ""pushing pixels"" you can always provided some value added projects and designs that you think may benefit your company or department objectives. Even if they don't use it, it will better hone your design skills under a professional setting. Always keep track of your designs and put them in a folder that can later be used in your portfolio. I think just experiencing a professional setting and corporate culture is good to balance theory and practice. Basically make the most of your internship, ask alot of questions, take on projects with people, the works.

To come full circle, I know some people who tried really hard in school for ""grades"" and were wishy washy with their portfolios and work experience and expected to get jobs at google as designers \*(they didn't)\* and others who did freelance gigs to build up their portfolio and did part time gigs for the Uni and hackathons etc to build it up while studying, and got gigs at amazon/facebook. Personally it comes down to your work ethic and what you can actually show employers via a portfolio and experience. You can take an extra year or semester at school and employers won't care, as long as you absorb and learn the most you can while applying that knowledge practically. A company isn't going to look at your A+ in ""Designing for the User"" class and be like wow, let me hire this person, without actually seeing a presentable product.

So to conclude, it's okay to take some extra time in school to supplement it with work experience. Experience is valued more than academic tenure in most cases, as it allows you to show off your skills in a professional setting. Work hard and build up your portfolio, do designs for companies you want to work for, address user problems they may experience and show your thought process as to why you think it could help them. Look at the information architecture, the logic behind certain interactions, the UI, the interactions themselves etc. and really highlight in your portfolio, that's what companies are basing you off of.

The best way to go with this is to perform a qualitative study. You have two options: individual interviews or focus groups.

Whatever you do, make sure they you focus your questions on the _problem_ you are trying to investigate. Don't even mention possible solutions or you are going to generate bias.

Being able to silence it during certain hours is huge. Choosing a notification tone is an exceptional feature as well - not even having to take my phone out of my pocket to know what app gave me a notification is brilliant.

I am also just entering the field as a CogSci grad. I can tell you from talking to people in the industry that they value people like us as researchers because of our ability to run studies, interact with users, and present results.

Some questions I got on my first interview they were very curious about how I conducted past research. Questions like ""how would you improve xyz"" and I would explain how I would identify problems, and the types of studies that I would use to research a solution.

I found [this](http://practicaluxmethods.com) site to be extremely helpful for being comfortable talking about different methods and when to use them.

RedditBlow5,">we have an app aimed at particular age group but we find that that age group is not using the product. What do you do?

I think your answer of taking their initial research at face value is a mistake IMO. I would ask them for previous research that made them believe the app they made was targeting this specific age group. Perhaps they were wrong. I would ask why they have the position that their app is not doing well with the particular age group, is it just a sentiment by stakeholders or is that based on actual analytics. I would ask them why they feel they need to target one specific group, one age group in particular. Then would ask for analytics to see what customer segments are popular with the app, Qualtrics/Comscore would be good to have if they have it, if not tell them to implement it. 

It would be hard to prove 
>do people in the demo not know the app exists? 

Without doing a rather large market research study, which would be best left with the marketing team if that were the case, it would prob better to just start with a general survey of what your users/ that particular demos needs and whether the current app fits those needs or not. And pair it with a competitive analysis as well.",1532061041.0
mscott087,"I can only speak to the one conference I’ve attended which was the Nielsen Norman Group UX conference in New York. They do them all over the world and offer A TON of different content/classes. I think that might be my only complaint. It costs a pretty penny to go so you have to cherry pick what you want on certain days. My work paid for 3 days (each day was one course) for me and came out to right around $2500 if I remember correctly. They also offer smaller bits of downloadable content for a price, Which to be honest I wasn’t totally thrown off by the price tag as one might expect. 

These guys definitely know what they are doing, as they’ve been around for quite some time and have the research to back it up.

Even if you can’t attend the conference I found that their course listings give you a huge list of relevant UX/design principles, which you can then research and learn on your own.

luxuryUX,"I spent a year in Italy doing UX Research for a large luxury conglomerate. Most of their cliental were high-networth individuals (HNWI). As you may expect, these people were not incentivised by money. One of the best ways of reaching these people was playing into their ego and making them feel part of an exclusive offer by sharing their time/insights. I'd work with the company I was consulting for to create a bit of an engagement funnel that captured their information during the ""selling ceremony"" (the purchase transaction) of a luxury good such as a handmade designer bag, suit, or watch, then after time we had a database we could reach out to and invite them to exclusive events and launches **if** they were willing to give their time to share their thoughts on a new concept or service (be it a new app, physical prototype, website).

Traditional out reach methods didn't work with this user group and we had to be **very** respectful and delicate during the testing process. But the insights we got from this were invaluable in terms of taking projects in a more customer centred direction. Learned a lot working in UX within the luxury industry. The explicit dichotomy between user/customer centiricty and luxury brand was really intricate.

I work in healthcare now. Still many user groups that are kind of difficult to reach (accessibility issues, low digital skills, spacific health issues/conditions). We just usually use a recruitment agency for labs, or we do pop-up research in places where we are likley to find people that we are looking for (e.g. English as a second language, low digital skills, etc).

soundofpolicewhoop,"I did Austin's Web Development Immersive course in 2015. While I did not have much in the way of previous programming, I was still admitted after a couple of interviews. I found the course was all over the place - to many technologies, not enough emphasis on the fundamentals, and one instructor was a student in the last cohort (a really great guy but if I am spending 15K for a class, I wan't an experienced professional teaching). 

&#x200B;

After the course, I started applying to programing gigs but quickly realized I simply did not have the skillset to be a competitive job candidate. So I started a largely self-directed apprenticeship to learn a few core technologies and build on a portfolio. It is now the end of 2018 and I still have not found my way into the tech industry as a programmer. 

&#x200B;

I found that those who found positions in tech after the boot camp largely had previous experience working with web development. Unfortunately, those who found jobs became surprisingly hum about how they got their jobs. I had to go back into a field I desparately wanted to leave (science) just to pay bills. Meanwhile I am shelling out about 500 a month to repay the loan I took to attend the boot camp.

I mean the course only took 3 months if I became a decent designer in a short time span from absolutely 0 then I must be a genius but sadly I am just a regular person who gets excited with tech and design. 

What I can tell you is there are people who still landed a job and those are the people who already have an art, tech, psychology or other disciplinary design backgrounds. 

and some landed a job even tho their skills are questionable because GA taught us how to network and gave us a lot of opportunity to do it and meet a lot of people in the industry.


It's really up to the student and how much work they put into for the results. 

Myself included...  I decided to keep on practicing until I think I am at least ""good enough"" to be responsible for a position. I am not rich.. but I made a plan to sustain this kind of ""education""

Did I expect it to be this hard to land a job? Absolutely not. 

GA does a lot of sketchy promises but it can work and it's not that easy.

> To qualify for something, the person needs to know what criteria is for actually qualifying for the reward

The problem is that human behavior is highly influenced by trying to please each other. We're always looking for rules of how we're *supposed* to be behaving. So if the recruitment criteria is integral to the research question, you have to ""hide"" the criteria so that the participant is ""blind"" as to what you're actually testing/researching so they can be free to act/speak ""naturally"" without being influenced by some assumption of how they're *supposed* to behave based on the criteria.

Also, more importantly, many people would just lie to get the reward.

The key is not to tell people the criteria upfront. It's to set their expectations right by saying, ""only some people qualify for the reward. You will need to take a 10-15 minute survey to see if you qualify.""",1531765501.0

Now suddenly almost every website has brought them back and the pop-up blockers are ineffective because the technology has changed. Some sites show it after a short period which is similar to the early ones and very annoying. However, most sites at least only show the popup when your mouse moves out of the browser as it’s assumed you’re going to leave the site.

legolad,"Good suggestions here. I would add this:

Most users will understand simple arithmetic and logic operations. As some have already pointed out, the trouble comes in the complexity. This then becomes a question of skill and scope. 

Let's tackle scope first. You need to assess your worst case scenario for complexity. That means you need to talk to your users. Or, if you have an existing app or site and the right web analytics, you can check it directly and see what they are doing today. If neither of these is an option, you can try talking to some experts on your team.

What you're trying to learn is the answers to these questions:

* Do your users need arithmetic operators (+ - % / * < > = =!)?
* Do your users need logical operators (AND, OR, NOT, IF...THEN)?
* Do your users need string operators (CHAR, LEN, FIRST, LAST, MID, FIND)?
* Do your users need to nest elements within formulas (e.g. a FIND within an IF/THEN)?
* Do your users need to loop formulas (FOR...NEXT, WHILE...WEND)? 
* Do your users need to prioritize elements of a formula (first this, then that)?
* Do your users need to build workflows (e.g. this triggers that, wait for response, read response, if response is 0 then do this other thing)?

It is a lot of stuff to know, but you need to know all of these things so you can define the right solution. Once you have the answers you need to figure out the patterns of usage for the parts that get used.

For example, if 80% of your users stop at arithmetic and logical and they only use one of those at any given time, your default UI can be VERY simple. You can then hide all the complex stuff in an ""advanced"" form. This may also be role-based, where, for example, one or two types of users are in the ""simple camp"" and a third type of user is in the ""advanced"" camp. This might allow you to check the user type and display the appropriate UI by default.

Let's assume you cannot predict your users' skill level. Let's also, assume you don't know what proportion of your users are highly skilled vs. low-skilled.

I would design a solution that is adaptable, with a simple UI first. Stick to easily understood items with a simple left to right expression builder. If appropriate, use a sentence building metaphor (you need a verb, a subject, and a noun) or a TurboTax approach (a series of questions that, when answered, yields a pre-built query). Users could then use preferences to swap to the advanced UI or perhaps ""expand"" the advanced UI on the screen.

We don’t frown on contractors in NYC – at least on the agency/studio side, and even the start-ups; in-house UX positions at established/large companies are typically reserved for UX Designers who want to make the FT commitment. But even there, contracting absolutely helps your résumé and portfolio, because there’s great potential to work with some really well known companies/institutions and challenging and visible projects.

Contracting in NYC however, depends just as much on networking (to grow your client base) as much as it depends on being a great UX Designer. You want clients that will recommend you within their network. 

I direct UX at a digital agency in NYC, and we definitely have our go-to UX freelancers. They’ve avoided the salaried-grind because they’re in-demand and can charge a handsome rate. I personally have drifted between contact and FT positions throughout my career in NYC, and can attest that it’s definitely viable here.",1531173287.0

If you are just starting out having a secure full-time position where you can get mentorship, grow your portfolio, up-skill/learn, and network is critical for setting a foundation. If you are just starting out and taking a contract is your only option then take it. But take into consideration the company and culture you will be joining. ",1531171510.0

sensitivehack,"I was an English/creative writing major. (I also have a degree in Math; I was a little split brained). I got into UX after finding the School of Information at University of Michigan. I didn't know shit about visual design when I started, but with some latent artistic sensibilities and after grinding for a few years at shitty companies that didn't know any better, picking up skills along the way, I'm doing pretty well.

Honestly I've met some great UX designers who had either English or film backgrounds. And some lackluster designers with graphic design backgrounds.

English degrees, IMO, actually provide very relevant skills. Specifically, the ability to think about narrative and human dynamics. An English major is equipped to think about how the interface will evolve, how people will react to it. They're used to thinking about perception and metaphor. Good critical thinkers. Research comes naturally. Whereas sometimes a graphic designer, for example, might get focused on static screens and end up with a garbage experience.

Skills you may need to build: you need to have aesthetic taste and be able to express ideas visually. Also, be comfortable with scientific method and using metrics to back up your ideas.",1531188281.0
legolad,"I majored in English and in Broadcast Journalism. Started work in Public Radio after graduation. 5 years later I took some part-time work as a technical writer which paid so well I quit radio. A few years later I was creating databases for clients (a skill I taught myself while working in Radio). 

After writing a few software manuals for small companies, mostly API documentation, I found a job documenting the LotusScript object model and acting as a Product Manager for the Lotus SmartSuite IDE. Along the way I picked up a lot of UX skills including usability testing, card sorting, etc.

Eventually IBM closed the Lotus office so I found a little startup and wrote their API docs. When the market crashed, I found another job as a Product Manager for a satellite TV company. In that role I tried to bring good UX to an engineering-heavy firmware team. Most difficult UX environment ever.

Years later I found a Product Manager role in a hotel company. I cleaned up a few internal products and then got picked to work on a huge global enterprise project. Bringing UX into that was difficult, but eventually they let us create a UX team focused on the software used by our 300k+ employees. Our team now works on everything employees and partners use. I do the user research, while others handle design and usability testing.

It's been a long 28-year journey (post-radio). In that time I've studied and learned more than I ever did in college. I have grown multiple skill sets including object-oriented coding, printed and online API documentation, project management, budgeting, product management, information architecture, corporate taxonomies, web analytics, ethnographic research, surveying, usability testing, writing proper use cases and requirements, writing QA test scripts, and on and on and on.

Some lessons I've learned:

* Let others talk first. You'll learn more.
* Share all credit, regardless of who earned it, because people will notice and want to work with you.
* Tell your boss what you've done, honestly, humbly, without bragging or whining.
* Eventually you will get to choose who you work with. Be patient.
* Allies are incredibly important. 
* Allies aren't necessarily friends. Allies are partners in your success. 
* The wrong allies can ruin you at a company, or even your career.
* Figuring out who your allies are can be difficult.
* When you're new, share facts, but keep your opinions to yourself until you know who your allies are.
* Don't talk shit about anyone, no matter how obviously incompetent they are, until you know who your allies are.
* Be patient. Your allies will reveal themselves. 

If you think this sounds like warfare, I understand. If you think the workplace should be kinder and less competitive, I agree. None of that changes the fact that the ""friend"" you made in orientation secretly hates you and talks shit about you behind your back. Or that person you were chatting with was passed over for your job so she has an agenda now. 

I'm honestly not jaded, but I'm realistic when it comes to what motivates people. Everybody comes to work for a paycheck. Only a lucky few come in because they love the job. If you're in that camp, congratulations, you're not most people. For the rest of you, think about all the shit you bring into the office every day. The fight you had. The thing your parents said. The news story you heard. The game you played. 

Now think about each person in your office. Each of them has the same amount of shit in their heads. They have to come in, clear their minds, and focus on a task, just like you. The best ones do this without letting the shit in their heads interfere or color their judgement. But we all have our bad days. So when someone isn't how you expect them to be, have patience. Be kind. Don't be an asshole, but don't let them take advantage of you. In the end, you have to watch out for yourself and your allies.

The BIGGEST lesson I've learned:

* Be kind to others, but watch your back. It's work, not your living room.

I'm currently a double major in English and Creative Writing in my last semester of undergrand and I am working on the User Experience Team for my University Library. It's a student job but I still get major projects and get to rub elbows with all the library big-wigs. I think as English majors we are very well-suited for UX because we know how to be nit-picky in the right ways. However, different UX teams (though the focus is always User Experience) operate in different ways. Some teams are more digitally based and may require more coding or tech knowledge, while others are more based in physical signage, floor plan design, etc. I am very lucky to be part of a team that operates in many different ways and works in all these different sectors within our library. I think technical writing experience is a big deal because that has a lot to do with UX. I also don't think you should be intimidated by or feel like you HAVE to be tech expert to work in the UX field - you don't. Content Strategy jobs are a lot like UX work, with writing as well!

1. In terms of books, Sam Ladner's Practical Ethnography would help you see how you can adapt your ethnographic skillset to industry. Kim Goodwin's Designing for the Digital Age is hefty, but it covers a lot of ground and does a great job of showing how research fits into the whole design process, as well as common ways that research is made intelligible to designers and stakeholders (e.g. personas, scenarios, experience maps, etc).

For advanced degrees (which are often preferred but not always required for research roles) there's many paths and programs you could take. Knowing better what you enjoy or want to do would help narrow that down. 

2. You're on the right track with the 'design-adjacent' stuff. A google search for 'ux research portfolio' will get you started in seeing what people like to see in them and how to build one. There's also good discussions about this in Slack communities like Mixed Methods (hosted by the people the run the podcast) and Ethnography Hangout (hosted by EPIC mentioned above). Like /u/RassimoFlom mentioned, just to get your feet wet you can design and run some more traditional UX/HCI methods like usability tests.

3. In addition to specific things like 'ethnography,' 'interviewing,' 'surveys,' etc (often trying to align this with what's mentioned in the job posting), the ability to communicate findings and rationales for methodology (especially to non-researchers), adapting a project due to changing circumstances, working collaboratively, and effecting change based on your findings are all good things to emphasize (of course not every project has to have all those things!).",1531018987.0

artseathings,"A couple notes. If you don't want to buy the new macbooks, look on apples refurbished section, and buy a refurbished older model that has the specs you want. This way you save a bit of money and you can still have USB ports. 
https://www.apple.com/shop/browse/home/specialdeals/mac/macbook_pro/15
I've worked on the older style and have preferred that to the newer one my job supplied.

Also, I'd check and see if your school is even using sketch or if you can use whatever program you want. I'd recommend Figma or Invision Studio (which would also get you Invision and freehand) if you want to make the jump to a PC. Both Figma and Invision studio are super close to sketch so of you ever have to switch it'll be pretty easy. Both of these work on Windows. Or if you are already buying the Adobe suite look into Adobe XD, I've not tested it but it supposed to be comparable to sketch.

If your jumping to PC my only 2 cents are that the Microsoft Surface line looks cool. And that will probably be my next laptop purchase. But saying that most people in the industry are still on Macs.

Once you are out of school your job will probably supply a computer, and programs. (Unless you are freelance or a very small start up or business), so I wouldn't worry so much about what your job wants you on machine wise.

Seems silly to throw down money for a new macbook if it will be out of date within a semester. You don't even get the benefit of reduced pricing for the older model since the new one isn't out yet.

Of course, after saying all that about obsolete models, I love my mid 2015 15"" MBP. It's the perfect machine for me. Has all the ports, has magsafe, keyboard feel is better and still plenty of computing power for what I need it to do. 

I have one of the touchbar MBP's for work and while there's nothing seriously wrong with it, its a bunch of little things that add up to annoy me:
- dongle life really sucks, especially if you need to plug in more than one USB device.
- battery life is not as good as my 2015 model
- no magsafe. Not only that, but the power adapter that comes with your laptop no longer has the extension cord so you'll have to drop another 50$ for that.

1) Research methods and design.  Can you learn how to conduct a good interview and analyze the results?  Survey design and analysis?  Good understanding of how the brain processes information and basic social science concepts.

2) If you can, try to learn some more advanced statistics and maybe some R or Python.

3) One of the most important things you will need is material for your portfolio.  Can you volunteer to do some research for your university's website?  Do research for a friend in the computer science program that made an app?  A local business or non-profit?  Can you find a professor to design an independent study or cap stone project?  Even if they don't work directly in HCI or UX hopefully they can still advise you. 

If you want to work at Google, Facebook, etc. down the road you will probably need a graduate degree.

roguetue,"I have used Pendo at two different companies and feel I have a pretty good grasp of its capabilities. We mostly used it as a product tool, but it can provide some good quantitative insights. 

Assuming you have tagged everything well you’ll be able to figure out what parts of your app are the most used. Second you’ll be able to trace some user behavior, but what you won’t learn is user motivation, you need to back that up with surveys or interviews. You can also establish baseline usage metrics to determine if your UX is improving (if you’re trying to get people on a new feature or a redesigned feature). 

Another thing you can’t measure is user frustration. I think Full Story does this better. I tend to think of Pendo as an event server with a nice UI on top of it. 

The onboarding and messaging tools are pretty good and getting better. But they take a decent amount of time to set up and sometimes I get a little frustrated with their limitations. We currently have 3 different teams, support, marketing and product vying to send targeted messages to users and sometimes we expect it to work the way a different tool we used before would work and it doesn’t. I think it depends on how much you use the guides and what your goals are for them. 

We’ve just started using guides to launch surveys in Survey Monkey and get user feedback on our wire frames. This has been really helpful. 

The most powerful feature we tend to use is the segmenting of users to target with different guides. It’s great because if they use feature X but not feature Y we can build messaging around that and show the value of using the other feature. 

It’s a pretty good product and it’s getting better all the time. You should also be aware it is not cheap. When I did my initial evaluation we looked at several products, WalkMe, UserIQ, Full Story, Jaco and a few others. At the second company I was an advocate for Pendo. We were really close to going with UserIQ but during the proof of concept our PM was a little frustrated that he couldn’t get the reports he wanted from Pendo. I hope you find all this useful.

This post literally says the equivalent of ""FM radios are terrible for driving cars"".

Let us look at a modern car with a touchscreen and sensible solution on board. It would be running some kind of Android system or something with equivalent level of connectivity. At this point you can connect the car with the phone. You destination might be inputter to the car without your interaction. Then you just drive.  When it comes to driving and operating the car subsystem or operating unrelated systems. You can literally tell the car+phone to play music, change destination, search for stuff, alter plans, etc. Te techc is already there. The touch screen is there cause people want to touch stuff. That's why phones, tablets, laptops, watches, cars, fridges, etc have touchscreens.  It works for everyone. It's simple. No training is required.
The last one is especially true. I had experience with couple of older cars with terrible design. They required to remember (or find by share luck in the manual) a special sequence of buttons to get to info like: fuel consumption and amount of km that the car can do with current fuel. With tachometers it was even funnier. I know I driver that writes don the exact time he starts the car, every break (start-end) and carefully plans the end of the trip so he is in sensible margin of time that he can drive. This info is kinda in the car, but it's a hell to get to it. Ohh. And on each car he drives, it's different.

Leading with a getting a quote as the first call to action the visitor sees may be too ""high-pressure"". if your business model is to help  people design a home security system without a sales pitch, pushing the visitor to get a quote might be a bit too aggressive. A quote often implies a certain level of commitment by the prospect, such as providing contact information. Also, (and I hate to say this, but...) the home security industry does have a lot of aggressive and sometimes ethically questionable sales tactics. Your ""no sales pitch"" approach is actually an antidote to that problem, but it doesn't come until later in the page. You best message is actually at the bottom of the page! 

Some other problems I see. It looks like you have 3 different calls to action, using buttons that don't really look like buttons (more like call-out blocks). Your home page also has a LOT of information. 

Typically, I've found the most success with landing pages that have a strong focus on a single message, such as how truesecurity is a different way to buy a home security system. Also, timing your sales pitch is critical, and maybe some onsite surveys or user testing can help determine if you're too quick to drive the user to a quote. I think you'd do better by first establishing trust, and seeing if you can covert your landing page visitors to a ""why we're better/different"" page.

For agencies the customer is obvious. You just have to document why every choice was made well.

I've had the customer be the VP sponsoring the project. They usually only show up to the sprint demo sometimes, so the meetings are a review of what we did for the last 3 sprints. It usually helped to have some insignificant part that they could feel like they helped designed that part. It kept them away from the important stuff.

The hours you log into a system will usually not affect your direct deposits, if you are working in a full-time, salaried capacity.

CJP_UX,"You're broadly talking about UX research, and it can be done about 1 million ways. If you want to do some research, the execution can be fairly simple but you have to narrow down your research question. What are you designing? A new info architecture? A new button location? A complete user flow change? These all might have different methods. The method you use is how you can know if users will find the solution useful/usable/expected.

Validating the design solution is the other piece of the puzzle. You do the research; what is clients don't give a shit? This is the struggle of the researcher. There are a couple tricks here. One convincing one is to use videos of users on both the old and the new. If your new design is better, show videos with audio where the user gets confused by the old one and takes a long time. This can be compelling evidence. Otherwise, data can sometimes tell a good story. Do 90&#37; of users complete the task with your new design and only 40&#37; of users complete the task with the old? That translates pretty well generally.

I have no idea what your research question is, so I can only really describe generally as above at this point.

geraint78,"I’ve been designing digital products for 20 years many of which as a trained UX designer. 

What took me a while to learn: You are never certain that your design is the right design and any random person might have a better idea than you. At the start I always felt I needed to show I’m an expert and 100% sure about my decisions. It’s just not possible. 

You can be very confident, based on experience, user involvement, research, etc, but never certain. Accepting this fact made discussions with clients easier and I found them more respectful of my attitude. It also opened me up to never being attached to any design decisions for the wrong reasons. 

I also see that not everyone is cut out to be a UX designer. It needs a brain that gets really annoyed by anything around them that doesn’t work intuitively and is always looking to improve these things. 

Good luck in your career!",1530243765.0
duxduxduxgoose,"I’ll try and give you some points you’re probably not going to find in a fluffy Medium article. I’ve built multiple UX and Product Design practices and teams from scratch at a few companies. Big and small.  

- UX Design is not hard.  But not blowing up scope and finding time are.  Be honest with your PMs.  

- Treat every idea that comes from a user and non-R&D internal stakeholder as an original.  Yes, I know you’ve thought of every possible solution....but telling people that will only dissuade them from contributing in the future.  A person only needs to hear “oh ya I thought about that” or “I have that idea mocked up already laying around somewhere” a few times before being annoyed or discouraged.  If this bothers you or seems hard to do then it’s time to check that ego at the door.  You own that design. For better or worse whatever comes out is going to have your name on it anyway.  

-  Be sure to shout out that person who gave you those suggestions (good or bad, old or new to you)

-  Getting product/r&d on board in companies that have never had a UX practice (or BAs moonlighting as UX designers) is not easy.  Repeat yourself a million times. Eventually what you’re saying will resonate. If people don’t believe you or aren’t listening...bring the numbers to back up what you’re saying.  Bring the designs. Bring the alternatives.  I’ve banged my head up against walls for years before making a breakthrough at some places.  

- Balance. This part is so hard. In order to change the culture to make UX possible you have to simultaneously push back (asserting yourself) and be the person that brings everyone together in support of solutions for your users.  Hard. But when you find that balance it is amazing.  

- Break down silos!   You are the part of the Venn diagram that encompasses them all.  See point above.  

- Unless you’ve also got an eye for UI or have a designer on your team...either keep things super simple or go with a front end UI framework.  No better way to mess up that perfect workflow than with bad UI.  

- Patterns are everywhere. Recognize them and use them.  Leave the bespoke stuff to Rolls Royce auto engineers.   

- Component libraries are all the rage right now.  For good reason.  Create your own. Even if it’s in Balsamiq.  Reuse elements whenever you can.  Consistency is super important for users.  

- Be collaborative when you’re designing. Your wireframes/high res/clickables/micro interaction animations should all be vetted by your team. (PMs, Devs,QA, stakeholders). There should be no surprises at handoff. 

- Let your users hold your hand through the development process. Leverage them. Don’t ask open ended questions though.  

- User research is gold. But so is feedback from non-R&D internal stakeholders and internal subject matter experts.   

- take the last three points together.  You’re now derisking design decisions.  Something sucks after it’s release? (Not likely if you do the 3 things above) “You can now say we did A, B, and C.  Let’s take another look at things” 

- Build a good repoire with your developers.  

- Be honestly and open with your PMs (see #1)

- Be QAs friend. 

- Implement a UX process.  Time for research should be a given.  Time to rapidly iterate should be built in.  Your mock-up should be part of the the acceptance criteria.  Can’t hit the high res?  Why?  This part is hard.  The two points above will help with this....but a lot of companies just aren’t ready for this.  

I probably have more. On a flight and exhausted right now though.

Wunderco,"Been in the industry for about 15 years, everything from kiosk and jukeboxes to TV and currently vehicles. Spent time as an engineer and some terrifying months as a PM. 

Great comments already in this thread! My two cents,
- Be kind to yourself and others. Designers must know their medium and in today's landscape, the organization is also your medium. Share and communicate with your triad (PM/Eng/UX) but also any stakeholders. Ultimately everyone is responsible for the quality of the output. 
- First be good, the be clever. An awesome design friend once said that and ever since then, I've been restating it over and over. In the world of AI/ML we tend to let the tech drive the solution, but if underneath the clever bits, the foundation is cracking, it will never feel quite right. 
- You will be solving the same problems over and over. Content discovery never goes away... Use these opportunities to iterate on your models.
- Be pragmatic. If you design the moonshot idea, chances are there is only time for 60% of it getting out the door. Choose your battles and prepare for the next release. 
- The right tool is the easiest and fastest to explain the concept. Just because there is a new prototyping tool out there doesn't mean you need it or know a new language to show something simple. Sometimes the best tool is just a white board. 
- Find someone who inspires you to be a better designer/lead/manager. Learn from them. And if you're incredibly lucky, report to them. Otherwise make them your mentor. 
- Booze makes friends. Like the first point, get to know your fellows. It's a whole lot easier going toe-to-toe w an eng lead if you are friends vs. that jerk who won't add transitions. (Also, they will teach you stuff too).
- What if convos are the fucking best. But, careful, it's easy to get trapped there. Write stuff down and show everyone, especially if those what if convos happen with cross xfn peeps... Engineers can make great what if partners, especially with booze. ;)

Here are the things I wish I would've known:

* The majority of developers are boring, antisocial and/or big, angry babies. I sometimes envy people working in fields like sales or marketing, because they get to have fun and friendly coworkers who don't obsess or fight over things that don't matter in the same way that developers do.

* The majority of UX designers have UX methodology-itis, which is a problem because they treat UX methodologies as scientific when they actually aren't. So you end up being forced to conduct unqiantifiable work that the entire company treats as quantifiable science, and then have to sit and watch as everybody misses the glaring problems in their assumptions, unwilling to listen to sense since it ""has to be true if everybody does it"".

* The majority of UX designers are married to the idea that nobody could possibly know anything about what needs to be done, and use qualitative UX research as the main tool to solve this (see the problem above with UX methodologies). What this leads to are specifications based largely on their own subjective assumptions and interpretations, which are often terrible, because those assumptions should be made by people who have a strong sense of product vision.

* Most UX designers are terrible and don't actually have a sense of what constitutes as good usability. They don't have a UX-oriented mind.

karenmcgrane,"I teach in a masters program and have done portfolio reviews for prospective students. If you want to create a new project for your portfolio, think about these things:

* It should be something large enough to be interesting, but small enough that you can execute the whole process fully. I often see people bite off too much with their portfolio projects and then they can't deliver on the concept. ""I want to increase voter turnout"" is too large. ""I made countdown tracker app"" is too small. Make it feasible but complex.
* Why are you interested in your topic? Having a back story for why you are interested in the topic like ""My brother has autism and I am interested in creating tools to help him communicate"" is a way better story than ""I asked Reddit for suggestions.""
* Do some actual research on your topic including some kind of in-person interviewing or prototype testing. It doesn't have to be with a million people or be the fanciest research out there, but it will go a long way if you show that you did it.
* They'll be more interested in your process than in the final product so make sure you keep notes about all your decisions, what worked/what didn't. Keep all your sketches and iterations. Be able to tell a good story about how you wound up with the final product and what you learned along the way. Stories about what went wrong and how you fixed it are more interesting than stories about how all your ideas are the best.

call_me_venom,"I'd suggest you stay on track with the field and read some general books. Don't make me think, UX team of one and, Design of everyday things, Designing for Emotion only to state a few. Then look into methodologies (Agile, Lean) to get an idea of the work-environment. 

Once you have a bit of a holistic view of the field and ideas about your entry point in terms of skills and drive, find a company that suits you needs. In my experience, there a slider where on one end you have Start-ups (governed by Lean meth and you have the chance at a generalist approach) and the other corporations (waterfall <most in a digital transition if they have UX>, or agile and become a bit more specialised).

If you are good at writing and enjoy doing it, you have Content Strategy which may be a good start and you will have loads of UX approaches (storytelling). If you want to come from a coding side, you have UX Dev, which kinda look at how information is organised (information architecture).

Despite not inexistent, I often found jr UX designers to be roles from companies that are just trying to implement UX in their approach and \*their\* idea of the role will be more focused on visuals, which is useful but counterintuitively unessential to the field. This will also turn to be something that won't give you the best idea of the field and might lead you to carry out a load that may be unrelated to UX and you have to evangelise it, which may or may not be that well taken. Differs from co. to co. I guess :)

ed_menac,"It's helped me be a more consistent and faster designer at the least.

For context, I'm a designer who has been doing mostly UX and graphic UI for several years. I'm OK at creating html prototypes, but I struggle with technical elements of code (CSS alignment can die in a fire).

Using our team's UI library, I can combine, tweak and conceptualise designs quickly. It also removes my temptation to design something bespoke at every opportunity.

Normally I Iean towards 'best individual experience' over 'consistency'. However the design system helps me to only break the mold when it's important. As someone working within a suite of web software, consistency across pages and tools is usually beneficial.",1530193416.0
cynthiahong,"I've had some experience building some components for my company's design system. I was working on a completely brand new library, so nothing was defined at all. 

It has definitely helped me design faster. You can easily grab and put elements on page within a few seconds and from there, it really allows you and your team to be consistent through the entire product. When the component in the library does not really fit your current use case, you can easily tweak it. With consistency, you have improved usability. It helps increase familiarity with the users due to the standardized components used throughout the whole software. With being able to design faster, I've had more time to do user testing. 

Sometimes I do feel like the system constrains some of the creative ideas that I had. There's nothing I really dislike about it. ",1530246623.0

Studies have show people are overwhelmingly more likely to donate to a cause if there is a direct correlation to WHAT the money is going for.  

For example - ""Donate $10 - With $10 we are able to buy lunch for 4 people."" - it doesn't have to be that, but make it something tangible so I have an idea of WHAT you're doing with my money. I have a much better grasp on how lunch for 4 people has an impact  than $10 random dollars.

-dillydallydolly-,"Probationary periods are quite typical even if you get hired on as full time. During this period, companies (and employees) can release themselves from the contract without as much headache.

However, since they are bringing you on as a contract and dangling the carrot of Full-time after trial period then your compensation needs to take that into account. As others have mentioned, contract workers typically make upwards of 30-50% more than Full time rate because of additional expenses and lack of benefits. However, being a small shop this company might not even have benefits for full time employees so take that into account if you decide to counter their offer.

Trial periods can sound risky but most times it's just a hedge against the risk of hiring bad apples, a mistake that can be especially painful for small shops.

Record the sorting sessions with your participants.

Note any comments they make, cards they seem to have difficulty grouping, or cards which they move around.

After the session, ask them about their decisions, understanding of the concepts, and their reasoning behind the groups.

Then, a bit of admin - type up the groups for each participant.

Ideally find a digital card sorting tool such as Optimal Workshop (they might have a trial or let you use it for free since you're a student).

Enter all your users data and then use the inbuilt analysis tools. My favourite is the ~~correlation~~ similarity map, which looks [like a big matrix](https://assets.optimalworkshop.com/prod/frontend/products/ss-os-results-similaritymatrix-422f2d63fcbeff61ad6df239ab17719d265b767a55d29d0381593e6146c02008.png).

Card sorts are either about associations so make an Excel sheet and if they were grouped together (just one category) give that card a 1, then combine data to see patterns in grouping. If you are having them sort cards into multiple categories do the same thing, just with consistent categories.

Do a dry run with a friend so you can get the setup right and plan out your data table to make sure everything is set up correctly.

Separately keep a log of qualitative results. So much good information and commentary comes up in a card sort that you don't want your quantitative result to overshadow. ",1529937056.0

OGKjarBjar,"I'd remove the prescribed categories and have them make their own categories. When doing user research, it's important we not lead the user down a path we want them to. Prescribing 2 categories, even with the option of making their own, will change the results you get. Users have a subconscious desire to want to do the test ""right"". Asking them to choose between making their own up (unknown ""rightness"") or using the categories you already made (clearly the ""right"" categories because otherwise why would they be in the test?) will likely get you mostly results that fall into your categories with maybe some outliers. 

If you're testing the mental models, that should really include how they think of categories/what they call them. Do users generally have the same terms for the categories? If they have similar terms, do they group the same items in those categories? Do different demographics have similar categories/groupings? Etc. ",1529960672.0

Oaklandia,"Interesting video but...

1) Not really actionable in terms of how to translate to doing UX research.

2) Major parts of the social sciences approach research through the concept of [grounded theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory) in contrast to the hypothetico-deductive that this video is basically talking about.  This is very much the case in a lot of UX research approaches as well and 100% valid.

3) UX research is (often) not about being generalizable, unlike academic research, but specific to a particular prototype/context/experience.  That alone changes the way research is/can be done considerably. 

4) Similarly, for prototypes you often can't get enough of a sample to do robust control/experiment groups.  Also, this work is often done by Data Scientists in industry and not by UX folks for live apps/sites/etc.

5) While this video introduces research from a psych perspective, UX research today has drawn from a much more diverse set of disciplines (anthropology, sociology, marketing to name a few).  For example,  Ethnography is about understanding the frames through which people understand the world around them, and is not focused on reproducibility in the same way.

While I agree a lot of folks think they are doing research, the idea that what is missing is the scientific method seems a bit off.  

Surveys are 100% primary research, I think the distinction you mean to draw is ""self reported"" vs. ""observed"" as opposed to primary vs. secondary.  *Both* have pitfalls and any research question should be investigated with an appropriate method(s).  The main problem I have seen in industry is poor survey design and analysis (briefly, but well covered in this video).

Since almost all UX research is proprietary, how do you feel you can make the assertion that surveys are done too frequently?  Seems weird to be demanding this narrow form of knowledge production and using pure anecdote as your foundation.

jetpolecat,"A year ago I got hired as a user researcher from another field, and this is my take on experience that may come in handy with a project job;

Interview people,  publish their pain points, pleasure points, and how many clicks it takes to get to core sections on the site. Many experts don't believe it necessary to interview or test dozens of people, as around ten people with spread demography in most cases suffice. ([https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-conduct-user-interviews](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-conduct-user-interviews))

Do a competitor analysis. Compare competitor site usability through heuristics, feature breakdowns, and overall customer feedback you can find online amongst top competitors, both direct and indirect. [https://usabilitygeek.com/how-to-do-ux-competitor-analysis/](https://usabilitygeek.com/how-to-do-ux-competitor-analysis/)

Surveys can answer questions, but it may be hard to gather a large enough number of respondents.  For the case of a portfolio, you can show your talent in gathering unbias responses by asking the right questions. Focus on justifying the psychology of each question, and how it seeks for the truth. 

Simply put, using interview feedback and competitor analysis you have identified pain points on the site, and gathered ideas from competitors to make it better. 

With project work, I recommend getting a client that approves you researching on their behalf. You want to ensure they also become a testimonial for you,  permit you to publish their project, and that you acknowledge the business objectives. And with a project, in most cases the goal is to demonstrate your thinking, as without a proper budget doing a good job is relatively tricky in UX and people know this. ",1529706271.0
pietro93,"I would advise *against* creating a survey at this stage. You should only use surveys when you have an idea of what you are looking for and need validation for that.

If there are iterations, I need the fastest way to update an existing prototype. Invision does all of that quickly and keeps it all up to date with syncing to my files.

2) I need to present my work easily with remote parties. People overlook Invision’s screen sharing functionality. It’s easy, and has a bunch of features that allow people in different locations exchange ideas on the screen at the same time within one web app that no one needs to install.

If I need to get fancy, I’ll look to Axure, Framer, or Origami but none of those does the above as quickly or with as little overhead as Invision.",1529674656.0

I see little need to spend extra time on detailed, beautiful interactive concepts when I can pair with a developer to flesh out the design. 

I only use more complex prototyping software if there is a specific interaction or complex behaviour I need to convey. I rarely mock a fully fleshed out design because it is often wasted effort. 

In companies where design is silo-ed.. You might see a higher reliance on high fidelity interactive prototypes because of the gap between design completion and starting development.

drndavi,"A friend of mine (a UX guy) complained long time ago that a couple of websites that he has used to quickly copy & paste symbols from are either dead or turned into ads-plagued pits.

He had an idea of building something dead simple and free, and asked if I'd like to help with actually making things work (he'd work on design/UX). However, he got too busy with his real job and that collaboration never really went further from chatting about it, with or without beers on the table. I liked the idea and after some (long) time I came up with something on my own that looks... kind of usable (to me as a backend dev).

I would appreciate some feedback: is it useful (does it make sense at all?) to you, is it missing something, things like that. Shoot with whatever remark or an idea you may have.

http://www.sakri.net

I've tried to emulate the emulate the mobile ""Recents/Overview Screen list component"" for my new portfolios navigation using the Html5 canvas.

The component still has some gitches, but I'm more curious about the user experience. I think it's ok on vertical orientation on mobile phones (users should be accustomed to this from their os). What I wonder about is:

* On laptops/pcs, is it obvious that this is a menu that users can/should interact with?

* overall, does it require ""too many clicks"" to get to specific textual content, is it annoying that the entire menu/navigation is not available in list form? (should I add this)

BetUrProcrastinating,"I need some help deciding whether to go into UX or not. So, I'm going to be a junior in college, and I've just been getting into UX recently. This past semester, I was a product designer at a school club, and part of what we did was create a google chrome  extension to help students with selecting housing for next year. This got me really interested in the design side of technology, and through some miracle I managed to get a UX design internship for this summer. So far, the internship is going really well, and I'm definitely learning a lot about the UX process.

But the problem is that I'm still unsure about what field I want to go into after graduating. I was originally planning to go into technical writing (hence the English degree), but to be honest it just doesn't seem that interesting to me anymore. The more research I do, the more I find myself interested in UX and digital marketing. Ideally, I would like to go into UX, but I've been hearing that it's completely saturated with junior UX designers. As an English major who only started getting into UX his sophomore year, I have no idea how I can compete with HCI, industrial design, cognitive psychology, etc. majors who have been interested in user experience since a much younger age. If I busted my ass I could probably get a decent portfolio by the time I graduate, but that's cutting it very close.

So I have a couple of options. I could just continue with my English major, and minor in psych and work really hard on my portfolio, networking, internships, and self studying, and hope I can weasel myself into a jr. position when I graduate. Or, I could just go into digital marketing, specifically niches that may have some element of UX in them (SEO, CRM, etc.) and try to get into pivot into a more UX related role later on, all the while learning more about UX and improving my portfolio. I'm leaning towards the latter, since where I live (near NYC), digital marketing is pretty easy to get a job in, and pays fairly well. If I do decide to go into marketing, I would probably minor in business administration or maybe CS. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks.",1531836169.0

funky-bob,"Hey everyone, I'm currently trying to get an entry-level job in UX design.

Recently I applied for a Junior UX design position. They invited me for an interview and sent me a design challenge which was basically ""Do a redesign of one of our landing pages."" I did the redesign and went to the interview, where I got the feeling that the Design lead I was talking to liked my work. 

Unfortunately, I still didn't get the job and they hired someone else. But I did not have the feeling that it was because of how I solved their challenge but other reasons (probably lack of experience). So I'm now thinking about putting the work I've done in my portfolio since it's a nice small project and shows that I can also work with already existing products.

But do you think that it would be smart to showcase work that didn't land me a job? I mean, what if I get asked about the reasons to do this challenge by other employers and had to tell them ""I did this for another job, but they didn't hire me"" – wouldn't that paint a negative picture of my design expertise?

throwawayuxer,"tl;dr If I'm already working as a UX Designer for a good company will a masters in HCI (or similar) make me a better designer, or help me to be taken seriously as one?

Context:

I worked my way into a UX position, having no formal qualifications in design of any kind (I have a degree in English). I consider myself a UX designer without much in the way of skills for UI, I focus on interaction and systems research and design, whilst others in my team make our designs beautiful.

I'm very happy with my career choice, but I feel flattened by some of the reactions I get from other designers who don't know me so well - they'll ask me how I got into UX, I'll explain, they'll establish that I have no formal design education, and then I'll be met with what seem to be insincere and fluffy well-dones and aren't-you-luckys. I feel like I'm being indulged. It's feeding my imposter syndrome, but I'm also aware that I might be a bit paranoid? I just find it crazy that people feel like moving from something graphic design to UX makes unquestionable sense, whilst my own path or skills don't. I want to be the best designer I can be, and I feel like I'm always learning and pushing myself to understand more, so it desperately matters to me that I am doing my best to be good at this, and that I don't miss opportunities to learn because I'm overlooked for having an 'illegitimate' path into the field.

Feedback from my team is very positive - my actual work seems to be respected.

AfricanTurtles,"So I have a decision to make. I have been learning web development on my own for 6 months and have a couple portfolio pieces. However, UX design is more in line with my personality of being empathetic and intuitive which would lend itself to making a good user experience in my opinion.   


The decision is whether to teach myself as I have done with web development, or to enrol in a 3 year college diploma program called Interactive Design and Development. I do realise that at the end of the day a portfolio is the most important thing. That being said, with all the bootcamp graduates floating around the market is saturated. Would a 3 year college diploma help me stand out from all the cookie cutter bootcamp people because it shows dedication to learning the in depth strategy behind UX? This program does have portfolio classes and also a design showcase at the end of each year.  


Another component of this decision is financing. Currently I cannot afford a bootcamp straight up. 12-15k is just a crazy amount of money considering I am 22, and nobody is there to help me out in that way. College would allow me to get OSAP financial aid to cover the tuition, and I could also work at the college during the year and during the summer months.   


What are your thoughts on formal education in this field? Surely it would help more than it hurts, but would love some input.

I want to get a UX job really badly.
My current Portfolio has only One Capstone Project. I did apply to lots of jobs for a month and then I stopped cause I didn’t get much replies. 

My question is: 

I can either go to another bootcamp like Design Lab or General Assembly. 
Design Lab has job guarantee ( COST $6k ).
General Assembly has NO job guarantee ( COST $15K )

OR 
I find a mentor and get actual clients, work on their websites. Write case studies.

First, the C Suite level will have a meeting with me and the senior engineers discussing features and high level requirements for what they want the software to do. Basically, brainstorming use cases. These use cases (""someone can use the software to do XYZ"")  ultimately turn into a list of requirements. 

I take that list, and organize it into functional pieces with the senior devs, and create a user flow diagram to conceptualize how a user would navigate the software.  Each step in the diagram becomes an action or a screen in the software, and serves as a resource when designing. Then, for each step, I create a wireframe for the interface, and arrange them in XD/Sketch in the same way as the diagram. This part can be very helpful when demoing navigation to stakeholders.

Then, its just a matter of refining my wireframes to full mockups, applying the visual design language and branding to, making them ""high fidelity"". Then, I link them all together so it becomes a clickable prototype, and get sign off from the C Suite and stakeholders.

iwannaberichby2017,"Note: I’m writting this on my way from work on my phone, so I’ll probably miss a couple of things. 

 To answer your questions:

- Yes, we do. We usually iterate on the process after a larger project (2-3 months). 


- We’re the biggest creative agency in our country. Approx. 140 employees.


- Depends on the project. If we only receive a pitch of what the client wants and the budget is big enough, it usually goes like:

    - Validate the idea (1-2 weeks). This is mostly the analytical department trying to find a market fit for the product. We carry out a couple focus group meetings with who we think might be the ideal user(friends, craigslist). These might not be the actual final users, but it gives us a good idea of whether there’s an interest in such product. For products with an already existing market fit, we for example set up a landing page to get some leads, the Robinhood style.

    - Find/define potential user (1 week). We have a sister company for finding these users. If we’re in a hurry, we use services like usertesting.com. Output of this phase are a couple of personas and a good idea of a direction which we should take. 

    - User journeys/user flows (1 week). We mostly use draw.io for this, since the whole company is running on Google services, and this integrates well into Drive.

    - First client workshop (4-8 hours). We create presentations in Google Slides, as we already have templates made for this. We take all the relevant info and present it to the client. Not really asking the client for feedback, just presenting facts. After this, we define a team: usually a Senior UX/UI, Junior UX/UI, Graphic Designer/UI, Analyst and a PM.

    - Wireframing (2 weeks +). If we get a green light from the the client, we move onto wireframing. We use Sketch with tons of plugins and our Internal wireframing kit. An important thing here, is to avoid creating any visual style, as the clients tend to comment on this, instead of the actual UX. We prototype in inVision with the CRAFT plugin and use Abstract for versioning. If there’s a need (and time) for interaction design, one of the designer makes a more interactive prototype in Principle/Framer. 

    - Test and iterate (2 weeks). There’s really no point in showing the client the design before a couple of iterations has been done. For our first user testing, we prefer guerilla testing(in-person). The following ones can be remote (via Usertesting or Lookback). After that, we present it to the client.

    - UI & Graphic design (3 weeks). We start by creating moodboard and validating it with the client. We prepare arguments for color and font choice, as these are the most common things non-design people have opinions on (from personal experience). After a couple of iterations, we create a prototype in inVision and do a quantitave testing. After this, we confirm the design with client, and hand it out for development via Zeplin/Avocode. 

There are a lot of little steps for each of these, but this should give you a general overview of how we do design. 


- I lead design, so I oversee everything and communicate with the client. We don’t have a hiararchical structure, so noone really has a final word. I mean, I do, but I try to stay as objective as I can ✌️

smldrnheap,"I work at a well-known, nationwide company with a little over 2,000 employees. We have a corporate technology team of about 200 people, and a UX team of 8 designers, VP of UX and 2 researchers. Our process looks something like this: 

* Attend kickoff meeting with Product Manager. In this meeting, we discuss requirements, timelines, ideas, etc. 

* Depending on the project, we might take the project into the lab at this point and get some user feedback (would they use the product, does it sound interesting at all, etc.)

* Begin wireframing process. Some designers on my team prefer paper/pencil first, some jump right into software.

* Meet with Product (most of us sit right next to to our PMs, so we have quick catch ups usually along the lines of ""What do you think about this?"", ""Did you have any other ideas?"", etc. 

* When we feel good about the design, have a meeting with VPs or C-level if need be

* Hand off to Visual Design - our wireframes are done in black and white, Visual Design adds branding, color, makes minor tweaks in the design 

* Write specification documents if need be

* Kick off to development 

* Review during development/after development is complete

* Release, watch numbers carefully 

* Iterate, iterate, iterate 

My role in all this is not only the wireframes but also setting up the tests (if need be), thinking about interactions, shepherding the project along, making sure it is developed correctly, setting up meetings, etc. Overall, I really like our process. Everyone in the company is familiar with it and it runs smoothly. ",1529596173.0

It follows to the core of:

1. Research
2. Define the problem
3. Brainstorm ideas
4. Prototype
5. Test

Do it over and over. But sometimes it's a 4 step or an 8 step process, and depending on the scope, it allows more fidelity. It also depends are we creating something from scratch or improving existing software. We pair into agile and devops processes. But some legacy programs follow the waterfall method.

Not all programs have UX efforts, but more and more do.

I'm a design lead and mission engineer, so I help with requirements gathering and development, work with user research and the customer. My biggest focus is in the brainstorming phase and initial creation, where then I hand off ideas and concepts to juniors to further develop. I lead design and dev reviews.

* **what steps does your company/you follow for a project or feature?**

1. The customer success team + product managers come up with project/features and communicate it to the UX team.
2. Someone on the UX team tries to put together a user flow diagram, realizes half way through that no one cares about it and time is running out
3. PM constantly pushes to produce wireframes so one of us produces something half baked based on a game we call ""best guess""
4. Wireframes are ""shared"" / brainstormed on. We're okayed to build out the front end.
5. Work non-stop to produce client side of the app with mocked up backend and that's when PM team decides to share more widely - which means we're iterating mostly on the actual app implementation and not wireframes. (So... why did we do wireframes?)

beasy4sheezy,"We don't have a defined UX process.

I am the only designer at a small start up.

Our process is sort of similar to others in this thread. It all starts with the C levels ideas for the product and a feature prioritization.

Since I have easy access to users, the next step is to learn how they work. Watch them do related tasks and ask them about their jobs (since our software is a tool, not entertainment).

From there, I like starting with a site map to establish navigation.

Then I assign actions to each navigation item, and cross check that against the prioritized list of features.

Now that I know what's on each screen, I start with wireframes. This is for me to formulate what I think are the best ideas for myself. Often times this results in multiple takes on the same challenge.

If I am confident in a wireframe then I will move ahead to hi fidelity in Adobe XD. If not, I will meet with C suite on what they like better.

XD is quick so I'm fine with skipping users in the wireframe stage. I find that they get distracted trying to understand the connections, and then are somewhat tainted to the hi to version.

Next I show the users the prototype. I don't like that I am presenting it, since we have so much functionality that it would take forever to actually link everything in XD. But it works okay. Usually it gets the users brains flowing pretty hard about what they could do with the software. I have to prompt them about what could be improved.

When the prototype is decided on, I discuss it with the head engineer and we break down the needed data and services to make the UI work, which usually brings up some unforeseen challenges for me to resolve. This is done before sprint planning.

The wireframe, prototype, and user check is done in chunks of functionality.

On my team, I write all the markup as React components and then deliver that to the engineers. This works for me but I know many of you won't agree. It helps me to ensure that the product looks exactly how I want, without going back and forth many times with the developers.",1529589026.0
guy91939,"Yes, we do have a UX process. It's needed to be consistent and bill clients for all parts in the process.

My last company's team size was 30 odd designers.

So, now on to the process:
Scope: what are you going to achieve? How much time will it take? How much will it cost? How many people of various skills are gonna work on it?

User Research: who are you designing for? Primary research about your users, their lives, and how the product impacts them.

Stakeholder Insights: why are your stakeholders doing what they are doing? What are the targets? How will this design solution help them? Understand them just as well as their users.

Ideation: this is where you storyboard, set core flows, identify limitations, identify pain points and elevate them. Give a structure (information architecture), set task lengths and move to wireframes (on paper or digital)

This is where you present to clients and seek approvals, etc. Some level of user testing can happen at this stage.

Define: at this stage a visual designer comes in (ideally should be there from the beginning), and this is where you extensively design the application/software/website. Take in all the documented flows (primary, secondary, tertiary). While documenting what the developers would require in terms of explanation.

Again, you seek approvals with stakeholders. Testing with users happens now. You learn and implement changes.

Deliver: you deliver the final output to developers on Zeplin.

Learn from releases again, and implement your findings. It's a constant process.

griz_fan,"## Do we have a UX process at work?

Sort of… we’re developing one, but it has been a struggle. 

## How big is our company?

Our company has over 40,000 employees world wide, but our group has about 600 people in charge of sales and marketing for our consumer goods.

Our team has 9 backend developers, a PM, a business analyst, 2 web producers (loading and managing content and product information across 14 regional websites), an analytics person, a front-end team lead with 1 tester and 2 front-end developers, and me working with an agency on design and UX. I’m also the business lead for our websites, so I represent us to internal stakeholders.

## What steps do we follow for a project or feature?

We’re still developing our process, and most of our work is to improve existing aspects of our website.

1. Our analytics person uses onsite surveys, web analytics data and feedback from our customer service team to identify areas of need and help identify priorities to work on.
2. I work with the business analyst to gather requirements from our internal stakeholders, primarily our sales and marketing teams
3. We combine this with the work from our analytics person and create a series of user stories. 
4. I’ve been working with our agency to build out an crude design system in UXPin, which reflects all brand guidelines, and has pre-built components representing all the various UI components we have already build. 
5. We use this system to develop a “high-fidelity wire frame” of the page in question. If a new feature/component is needed, we’ll create that, too.
   1. These high-fidelity wire frames are much easier to review with our internal team.
6. We then review with the internal stakeholders and iterate until they feel we’re addressing their business needs.
7. We then conduct user testing on these wire frames and iterate as needed.
8. After that, we hand off to the front-end developers, if needed, for HTML/CSS/JS work. 
9. Any features or changes in need of backend work then go through that team’s workflow and release schedule.
10. At go live, we follow up with the analytics person to start measure any changes.

## What is my role in the process?

I work with the internal team to manage expectations, define requirements and keep any changes within the realm of what the developers can deliver in a reasonable timeframe. I also work closely with our design agency to build the wire frames, and also help with stakeholder feedback.

## What would I change?

Its a constant struggle to keep the internal stakeholders focused on giving us their business requirements instead of proposing design solutions. Seems like everyone is a closet web designer.",1530226694.0

Frankly I prefer invision method of placing the desired fixed elements at either the bottom or top of the artboard. That way at least the core design can be easily viewed while designing.

* I check in from time to time just to see what people are posting, and learn a bit more about their field and business.

The result of this is the following:

* I often share connections with hiring managers and in-house recruiters that I'm currently looking to get work with, which can be somewhat of an icebreaker. If the hiring person casually mentions a company or friend, and you happen to have met them or at least know about them, then mentioning that can make for a more personal connection.

* I frequently end up applying for jobs where it turns out that I already know the hiring person from earlier. This usually immediately gets you a foot in and a friendlier attitude from the recruiting person.

* A few times I've gotten jobs directly from my network.

So, I'd suggest combining this approach with seeking job opportunities both directly with employers as well as trustworthy recruiters.

I've heard that the UK has a ton of really awful and skeevy telemarketers that pose as recruiters though, so if that's what you're referring to then stay as far away from them as you possibly can. They're not professionals. They're monkeys with guns.",1529393411.0

* Less robust but free is POP by Marvel. Mobile only, I think.

* Sketch is ""easy"" for a total beginner to learn, but sort of a bitch for those of us with decades of Adobe experience, imo. It's structured differently.

Licia0912,"In my experience (~6 years) a11y has been discussed as an overall usability problem rather than specifically for a user type.

For meand the teams I've worked with, things like screen zoom and color contrast are equally as important as ability to navigate using assistive technology, giving all users multiple ways of navigating the experiences based on their unique situation.

Regarding WCAG being seen as incomplete, I'd question what exactly is seen as such. I know the WebAim team tests their guidelines on a variety of user types, so I'm curious about specifics.

In addition, it's frowned upon (if not Illegal) to have ""accessibility testing"" as it singles out user groups (this is according to the WebAim folks who I took training with last year). Accessibility should be tested as part of the you call user testing, making sure to include individuals from many different user groups.

Illustrator is 30ish years old so it's a very mature app and it's integrated in to the Adobe suite. Sketch is quick and easy and lacks a lot of stuff, but it's plug-ins means it's really catching up quickly.

Invision you can learn very quickly as it's a glorified sharing platform that I personally find way to buggy and restrictive, but each to their own. I never learned it and was able to use 80% of it's features by guessing or googling with no workflow interruptions.

There's tons of free Sketch you tube videos. Just grab an interface and recreate it. If you really get stuck PM me and I'll try fix your problem, but otherwise it's a very, very quick learning curve (hours) and is probably why it's so appealing. I used to train people in Illustrator years ago and it's just SO much harder to learn as an app. However it's my choice for a lot of things.

Also Omnigraffle is worth looking at as an aside. It's just really fast for flow diagrams, AI work and detailed analysis.

My personal advice is to learn grid layouts, typographic layout and information hierarchy - something that underpins UI and design. It's a stumbling block of a lot of younger designers I work with. There's no excuse for it but I see it a lot.",1528975037.0

I don’t even use illustrator or photoshop anymore for application design. Of course you’re always going to need some kind of photo editing program if you’re working with photos in your application that require editing. Most big data apps won’t require this though. It varies from company to company, but one of the biggest reasons aside from it becoming an industry standard why InVision and sketch are required is usually because there are legacy files within the company that someone else had already created.

Seriously though, you can't be expected to actually work on anything *real*.

Get ahold of some of the previous work done by their old designers to see what they were working on.

2) Build a portfolio of work.  This doesn't have to be pretty visual designs.  My secret regret is all the photos of whiteboard I merely took so that I can remember it.  Do that, but also take a step farther back and capture a nicer portfolio photo of the whiteboard and stakeholders.  Capture sketches.  Capture sticky notes and affinity diagrams.  A good UX portfolio shows your work.

Depending on the customer and project constraints (budget, time, goals), you will have to figure out which approach makes more sense for the project.

Of course there are benefits to working with a team, such as cross training and knowledge sharing. However, a team doesn’t guarantee good  UX results or project success any more than being on your own.

You have the unique ability to work and learn from C levels to others. To understand how UX as a whole can impact just not that project but the company overall. In this type of environment, you're the expert. You drive how things happen. You tell them that while you can code, your creativity and how that creativity drives what the product is or the company does isn't being fully utilized etc.

See, you want to be in world 2. But, your not doing anything to ""create"" world 2 while being in world 1. 2 just doesnt happen. You create it from the inside out by showing overall UX value and your value to the company and more.

After 25 years I work directly with CEOs and founders of companies. Names that are large. You build up credibility, reputation and leverage that to going where you want to in an environment of your own creation.

I just did a CEO roundtable Tue from 3-5 that went until 6. I had 13 CEOs all totally engaged with what I had to say about Design Thinking and UX and how it related to their companies, the ROI and how CEOs should embrace and make their head of creative, UX whatever their right-hand person with a seat at the table.

I found customer research appealing and interned at a UX research agency before my final year.


Instantly knew it was the right career for me. I'd always been interested in technology and art, but only as hobbies. UX touched on both, as well as using a lot of my psychology training in cognition, neuro, visual attention and learning.


I also find the field appealling because I am a dilettante and I like to have a broad range of activities and skills to work on.


Spent 3 years doing only UX research, and felt like I'd done everything I wanted to do and learnt all I could.


Moved into UX design 3 years ago and I'm still going. The variety is the best part for me. Visual design, UI coding, problem solving, writing, research, data analysis, it has everything. There's so much I have to learn and develop, whenever I get bored I can try something new.


Also I enjoy the underlying principles of UX. We don't do stuff because it's cool, or for personal fame, or to make a quick buck. It's all about improving the experience of the user in whatever way possible. 


You know that ['find your calling' Venn diagram?](http://www.humanbusiness.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Purpose-Venn-Diagram.png) UX is the centre of that, in my opinion. 


I like going to work, and I enjoy my job. Can't ask for more than that.

So both can be done. Just be aware working from home is not for everyone.

Our remote staff honestly end up doing significantly more research than any one else due to their location.

dodd1331,"I've worked across agency, in house e\-commerce, retail banking, and Government in my career and to be honest I think the Gov.UK standard for product/service delivery hits the nail on the head in terms of creating the right team, setting a structured work environment, and setting achievable goals (I might be biased because I've worked on amazing services with great talent while working in Gov).

I like working on a team that works collaboratively in an agile setting, with each person specialising in **one** thing. Be it Interaction Design, User Research, Development, Product Management, etc. I found some companies hire a vague ""UX"" person thinking they can literally do everything from user research, indepth visual design and prototyping, stakeholder meetings, product planning, etc (yes, those people are out there, but to do all these things at a high level is **very** rare)

I also really like that [GDS Agile Delivery has clearly defined stages of service delivery](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*L-vdHCA8MZN9DCBcdKedJQ.jpeg), which is neatly defined yet not too perceptive in terms of approach or methodology. This lends to work culture where people are able to deliver their best work, work collaboratively, and respectively challenge methodologies and teammates. I think the biggest thing is having a discovery phase in which projects and services are allowed to fail if research points to there being no value in pursuing it. Let me tell you, (especially coming from an agency which delivered garbage on a regular basis) having a safe environment where evidence\-based decision making is happening and things are allowed to fail is a breath of fresh air.

Going to this type of environment was eye opening, in that delivering great work isn't just about **team,** its also about **culture and resources.**  If you have a manager or a work culture focused on delivery for delivery sake and not value creation and impact...you're going to have a bad time (I know I did before leaving my last company).

Great team \+ Great culture = great work & happy employees ",1528822621.0

For example ""That's great, we're building this FAQ to help users find answers. So to measure how successful we're being, lets see how much it decreases support calls"" or ""how many users expand each article"" - Whatever you think is the value which would resonate. That way you come to a compromise - you're adopting their solution, but they agree to the test which will prove it is successful or not.

If teams aren't willing to listen to ""I have some experience here and I am making a judgement this won't work"" then the next best option is ""What is your criteria for success, and lets measure against that"".

Without knowing the project my access points would be:

- Add anchors and index as well as navigation jump point back to start. 
- Make the elements partially hidden (accordeon). Show only questions and parts of the anser with a ""show more"".
- Make sure google has em indexed right. Good H1/2/3 etc. structure. Don't underestimate the power of google! You might catch lots of people by solving their exact question.  
- If possible: Add a good/sleek search but this is harder to implement. (Focus is on good and sleek. Most per default search engines will spit out too much irrelevant stuff)

aruexperienced,"BCG and Bain I can’t talk for, but I suspect they’re the same. McKinsey operate a traditional management consulting model. Usually (but not always) 4/5 people teams to go in and do some heavy lifting, big picture thinking or internal restructuring. Their clients will be big organisations who need huge logistics platforms redesigning or global brands re-strategising. The sort of stuff that falls outside of the remit of marketing agencies.

The “digital” side of it simply means that they’ll transform your business towards a more digital-centric model, both structurally and strategically. It’s literally known as ‘business transformation’ and it could, for example, involve taking a large, global client with old school, waterfall, off line methods to a more design-thinking / UCD agile method of working. They also have a product they call ‘business intelligence’ which helps companies become way more researched focused by integrating big data along with the usual analytics platforms like Salesforce or MS Dynamics. They’ll also try and sell you on the latest buzzword tech as well like blockchain integration, innovation labs, ai, chatbots etc. It’s all very expensive stuff as well.

They’re a bit late to the game, but as is always the case no one ever got fired for hiring Microsoft.

Don't expect much operation wise though besides advising on using XML format after interviewing all parties involved for months.

If you want to see many different type of companies on the inside for lets say for a year by doing consulting projects, then do consultancy for a bit, and then join the client side of things for a much higher salary (thanks to 'coming from a big consultancy') and less hours.

How substantiated are your feelings about that disconnect?  Is that your opinion or something you know to be true from customer research?

Above all else, capture your observations, insights, and ideas because the fresh perspective being new at an organization brings can be both very powerful and valuable. Develop these things over the next week or two and build up to making those larger suggestions and use your research as the empirical basis for doing so.

ed_menac,"Yes. I realize this is a controversial answer compared to the others, but I think it's better than keeping quiet.

It depends how you deliver it though, and how much thought you put into it. If you can justify your reasoning, give other good examples to illustrate your point, and present the critique in a non-confrontational manner... Then do it.

If not, and it's just going to be an opinionated ranting whine, then don't bother.

Use it as an opportunity to demonstrate your acute design sense and hypothese some areas you would want to test with users. Even quickly mock up some alternatives you want to try and take them along. Show your enthusiasm. Who knows you might get asked to take it forward.

In the end, the chances are nothing will happen, but at least it might reiterate the problems in the mind of the designers.

helpwitheating,"Definitely write these ideas down. As you collect more information about the company, you can share them. You haven't put any research behind them.

If you share your ideas now, you're basically saying: **""I've done no research on how this business works, but I think I'm smarter than all of you. Here are the first ideas that popped into my head when I walked in, which none of you have ever thought of, because you're all idiots.""**

First: The thing is that your team has to answer to multiple stakeholders. They can't just do what's best for one customer segment. They have to do what's best for all the customers, the business, the stock value, advertising, etc etc. So what might be a GENIUS move for one demographic could DESTROY the business.

Second: A total rebranding might not pay for itself. A company can't just follow, ""Hey, this seems like it could be a good idea."" It has to be: ""Spending XYZ on this rebrand will bring in # more money this year, # more money next year, and will pay for itself by 20XX."" How much would a rebrand COST? What PROOF do you have that users want a rebrand? What PROOF do you have that a rebrand would increase sales? How much would a rebrand increase sales? If you have no proof or research, you can't make anything happen in any business. You have to solve problems that users want solved; you have to demonstrate customer demand. You can't just say, ""here's a product that no one said they wanted, but I thought it would be cool."" You can't just come up with ideas off the top of your head. All your ideas have to grow out of data. If your ideas do not grow out of real user needs that you have discovered through data mining or substantial interviewing, they are useless in a business. Totally, utterly worthless. Not worth pursuing at all. You are a user experience designer. Everything you do should come from data. That's what user experience design is. If you want to be an artist, go into graphic design. You work for a business, not an art gallery. You can't just make ideas you think are good happen.

Third: The company has probably tried all of that or considered it before. A lot of entry level employees embarrass themselves by suggesting things the company has already done, or questioning things the company has put a lot of thought into. This just shows that the entry level employee didn't do adequate research on the business and doesn't know much about it. Before you make your suggestions, make sure to research a) if the company has already tried that, and b) if any competitors in the industry have already tried that. If you make your suggestions now, this is the response you're likely to get: ""Thanks for your idea, intern. Good work. We tried a total redesign a year ago. Our main competitor just did what you are suggesting six months ago. It wasn't a successful venture. I guess you didn't do a lot of research on the industry or even our company before showing up here."" ",1528593485.0

This runs a huge range of work (e.g., research, evaluation, policy, planning), and most often takes place in NGOs and government agencies (many other applied social scientists work in similar roles). I got my feet wet during grad school by working with a group of Engineers Without Borders students, who were working on a crop irrigation project with a rural community in South America. As you can imagine, knowing about the people and place where they were designing and implementing this system was critical to the system's success -- how do you build infrastructure (albeit small-scale) in place where the landscape is sacred, or where water and land are held communally instead of privately? How do you involve local stakeholders and community members in the design process? How do you ensure you are helping fix the right problem and in the right way? So I helped train these engineering students to think and work ethnographically. I did similar work for a network of local foodbanks, and some other smaller projects. As I was finishing up grad school and starting to apply for jobs, I realized that UX, at least to me, was essentially applying these same human-centered design approaches to the digital world.

Critically, the important things were safety (i.e. error prevention) and speed.

One thing that stood out as particularly great example was the numberpads on the IV drip controllers. Apparently they used to be physically difficult to press the buttons, little to no feedback, easy to mis-press a button, and without intelligent safety mechanisms. As a result it was feasible that a nurse might put an incorrect dosage into the machine without realising.

The UX speaker described how they had monitored the usage and then made some changes. For instance an instant display of the entered number, with alerts if the figure entered was too high (e.g. due to an extra digit).

Someone here said that UX research is the same regardless of what you’re looking at, and in some ways that’s true but I think it can be more complex.

I also wrote a research proposal for a hybrid robot-houseplant cyborg that would occasionally interact with a human to ask for water, but I never got a chance to carry out the research (I moved to another university). The cool thing about robots is that they are extremely multimodal, you can often see them and hear them and touch them (and i assume in some cases even smell them and taste them).

We also did some stuff with Brain-Computer Interfaces, with some friends we made a BCI version of the nokia game Snake and evaluated the player's experience.

YOU *CAN* DO THIS.  Some thoughts, in no order whatsoever:

* In a city with a startup scene?  GET INVOLVED.  People will be desperate for help getting things off the ground and your ""I don't have formal whatevers"" isn't a barrier for entry, *at all*.

* Check out https://startupweekend.org/.  It's like a meat grinder for product design and startups, and a good way to meet local people in the scene.

* Your high school achievements are a gamble.  They could be really sweet, but as soon as you say the words ""HIGH SCHOOL"", you've already been written off.  So... they're just ""YOUR WORK"", not ""look at this award I won in high school"" projects.

* Create a (new) body of work: your professional work. Make a super simple website, or get onto sites for designers, and **resolve to create content** as frequently as possible.  Stick to a schedule and give yourself work, even if you're not working for someone in UX.

* Another way to create new work: work on Open Source projects that suck from a UX perspective.  Treat it like a master's thesis: do everything you can, document it, and put it in your body of work on your site for prospective employers.

* Network.  If I could go back in time to my 19 year old self I would ... pummel the shit out of myself.  AFTER that, I would tell myself how networking with people is the single easiest way to find work.  In many cases, it's not *what* you know that gets you a job; it's *who* you know.

beasy4sheezy,"Man this was an interesting read!  Thanks for sharing.  This is exactly the type of stuff that I wish the sub had.

I would definitely recommend that people read it, but I'd like to provide a TLDR if they dont.

**TLDR:**

# Dope random quotes:

""The scientific nature of logics implies the art of reasoning.""

""Software is to hardware what mind is to brain.""

""The computer interface may eventually metamorphose into a total sensory environment.""

# Some summary

Semiotics is the study of symbols.  Symbols are used to represent objects.  Signs are the intersection of a symbol, the object it represents, and the context of its interpretation.  Keep in mind that signs are interpreted in relation to nearby signs, like letters in a word.

When extending this concept, basically everything we know is through interpreting signs.  Hearing words, tasting spicy things, knowing that a text box is a text box, are all just the brain collecting stimuli and interpreting them in the mind.

Interfaces are where two artifacts or humans meet.  Signs are used to mediate interfaces, ie. communication between two parties.

The scientific part of studying signs happens in the interpretation stage, and seeks to answer questions about how changing factors influence the sign's meaning.

In interface design \(designing the communication between parties\), friction occurs when the the two parties' ""user models"" don't match.  For frictionless communication, the two models must be logically consistent.  If I think 1=1, you should also think 1=1, otherwise, we're gonna have a bad time.

Generally, there are two approaches to communicating the objects and available actions of a computer program \(basically all a program does, give objects and let you action on them\). 

1\) Try to emulate the logical rules that people already follow with other symbols in the world.

2\) Challenge the user with a totally new way of thinking \(essentially, be forward with the fact that the user hasn't encountered your logical pattern before, so they don't apply the wrong thing\).

Either way, the user will be learning to interpret the signs that you give them and attempting to use the rules that you've defined to interact with the system.  This means that once you've created a rule for a certain condition, that rule should apply always inside your system. 

When attempting to design for one user, it's tempting to place them on a scale from novice to expert, but that removes the line between a user's knowledge from other areas \(competency\) and their knowledge in your system \(experience\).

It's better to think like this, although it's still simplistic:

SQL is a great skill to learn, but you will have to put a lot of time into it to get comparably little benefit. Database design principles and relational modelling on the other hand would be very valuable to you if you are designing software and would not require the same level of investment. 

Full Story is a product I am learning at the moment to understand how people move through an application, where they lose interest, get confused, 'rage' click, etc. Feedback like this is invaluable to validating or invalidating your hypothesis about what makes an experience successful. 

Agile development principles would also be useful. Understanding how a development and design team collaborates, communicates and prioritises aspects a project will give you an insight into the complexities of building products and will enable you to be mindful of this when working on your next project. You may have some really fantastic ideas, but if you are able to envisage the effort required to achieve it in the time you need to, then it will help you prioritise which features to focus on first to achieve the most benefit in the shortest space of time.

I met with several hiring managers in my area for this field beforehand only then hearing everyone of them mention the name of this boot camp and the scores of people they hired from there and everyone gave me the full scholarship price. 

Leads me to believe if you want to learn from them, online courses could be plenty but if you want to switch careers you need 12+ weeks of working with experts in the field. When they will sign off on you, employers don’t ask twice.

I would  agree with what was said about getting out of the course what you put in. Honestly, one could complain all day about any course or school and how it’s not as adequate compared to another, some negative stigma about this one or the that, etc.

I’m self taught in everything I’ve ever done professionally and would say that UX is something I found to be not self teachable.

I’m very happy with the decision I made in taking the course. We worked on 5 projects, three of which can be solid portfolio pieces, which is what you really need if you’re going to want to land a job after the course. For our final projects we work with real clients who ask you to solve real problems that they have, to me that’s priceless. I was also fortunate enough to continue working with my final project client and got to see the work through to launch.

I also met amazing people whom I consider to be great friends today, we still get together to talk shop, or just hang out. Though, I feel I lucked out on that front because I know of a few other cohorts at GA who just didn’t get along with one another.

The only problem is the mentor wasn't really there and don't keep give feedback on why it doesn't work and how to improve (the instrustors have full time jobs and doing this on the side after work). But it could totally change and vary from classes. It was $4,000 for the part time at the time.. I kind of regreted but I was glad I learn because i have trouble learning just from reading books and online courses. I was hoping getting more mentorship, but oh well.

Also the part time is very short we only do one project (yourself) unlike the full time course. Part time is very slow pace and getting to the basics. There are some group projects like exercise, but we don't really work on the projects together. We do help each other with our own project by getting different perspective.

Your publications are meaningless in industry because p < .05 for that 6 month project is not financially viable.  You need to be able to show that you can turn around actionable results rapidly.  While there is some presentation of results required usually dedicated research roles aren't typically required to do advanced infographics, just some nice charts from Tableau.

Some recommendations:

* Talk to the PIs in your program and get a list of companies that have worked on industry / academic grants in the past, contact those companies directly, especially if you can find out the research lead
* Talk to your co-op office in your school and get a list of companies that have placed people in similar roles
* Look up UX Researcher on LinkedIn and make a list of companies that have people in that role working for them, contact them and ask if they ever hire short term interns
* Download the free trial of Tableau, watch a bunch of the how to videos if you don't already know it, grab some large and interesting data sets, find ones that are compelling in a business setting, mock some questions and data analysis - make a portfolio of your results = win.

dreamevile,"Hey there,

I understand your position well. I just wanted to say that if you really want to get into ux, keep trying because ux is about being multidisciplinary and inclusive and ideally accepts different skill sets. Similar to you, i’m a graduating student and i’m working on my design portfolio and i realize i’ve been missing the point all this time. I thought, hey my work should speak for itself and since i’ve been doing design for over 8 years, i should be qualified enough. But i’ve since changed my perspective after digging deeper. I’ve become more story-driven in communicating my work, and employers often look for people who can communicate their ideas really well.

Yes I do have a graphic background myself, but just having that isn’t enough for ux. What I lack in technical skill, i make up for it in communication. When looking through online portfolios to reference, the one defining trait that stands out lies not in how good the idea is, but the way they explain the journey and process. It’s hard to put it in words, and I often say to myself, if you get it you get it. Repeating this to myself helps me put what other people advise into perspective and I just accept that in the process of understanding, it is alright to struggle, and then one fine day, you eventually get it. I am guessing what i’m saying also applies to ux researchers.

If i may direct you, [tobias van schneider](http://www.vanschneider.com/series/series-series-how-to-get-a-job-at) made a really good interview series with top brands on how to land a ux job with them. Reading this helped me bridge the gap between the understanding of employers and designers. Also he has a list of inspiring portfolios [here](http://www.vanschneider.com/10-inspiring-ux-portfolios-work) and the one that stands out for me is Liz Wells by a long mile because of the way she communicates her ideas.

Don’t ever think you’re not good enough, but always acknowledge you always have room for improvement.

,"I’ve seen a pretty good spread, having worked for companies of 5 to 5000 people, as a designer and as an engineer.

As a straight white male, I have also never felt out of place, lol.  There are still wayyyy more of us in the industry than any other particular shape or color of person.

On a personal scale I have found that the assumed differences between design and engineering, large or small, stable or disruptive are terrible, I mean utterly worthless indicators of politics and personality.  Some of the most conservative people I’ve met have been artists, some of the most liberal have been engineers.

That said, contemporary UX is about systematically challenging assumptions to enable broader audiences.  Regardless of personal politics, it is impossible not to engage with our social and political landscape, insofar as this informs innumerable aspects of even the simplest user story.

I can see how people who are not accustomed to these subjects being front-and-center on a daily basis could feel uncomfortable.  I can especially see this if they are part of a historically “normal” demographic — when every product your entire life has already been designed with you in mind, it can be hard to see the value in challenging those assumptions.

Unfortunately there’s no real way to exist in UX without being able to engage with experiences and perspectives outside of your own.  Even if you manage to duck out of every empathy exercise, you’re still going to have to deal with accessibility standards, language guidelines, personas and demographic research on a daily basis.  Enabling people of different abilities and backgrounds is *the job.*",1527814396.0

1. I cannot ""save"" the doctor I like to contact them later.
2. Because I cannot save, I left the browser window open.
3. The app logged me out overnight \- there is no need for security, however, on their provider page \(it shows none of my personal details\)
4. The log out view \(you've been timed out\) did not have a button to click to log back in

I think maybe the gamification (missions etc) might also be a hinderance depending on your user base. Looks like a good set of well defined steps for a successful event (its for events right). Maybe there is a way to clean it up, or use a different tool?",1527730000.0
omgitsjavi,"You have way too much information being presented at the top layer (what people see when they first open it). 

For starters, limit yourself to only one column of reference information (what you call Missions). That information does not need to be front and center, and having so many columns greatly adds to information overload. Each list of Missions can be compressed into a single card containing the information as a series of bullet points. So ""Initial Setup"" is a card containing setup tips, ""Building Your Activity"" is another card below that, etc. It's okay for these to be information-dense, because they'll be easier to read that way.

A Trello board works best (especially for new users) as a HIGH LEVEL overview. Focus on getting people used to using the Sprint workflow in the simplest possible way, starting with creating a new project card on Day 1, and tracking it through to completion. Let them figure out how to keep track of all the details, at least for now, but definitely make sure to show them how to put information in the card they create (checklist, description, attached files).

The scoring system adds too much complexity to something that users are already struggling to understand, and honestly I would just shelve it for now. Also, card filtering is a feature for advance users, and I would avoid relying on it.

Have ONE card at the beginning called ""How To Use This Board"" focusing on a simple explanation of the steps for using this tool (from the start of a project through to the end).",1527750759.0

Are you talking in person tests? Or remote (Skype or Join.me)? Or remote unmoderated? There are so many testing platforms that offer remote unmoderated right now for reasonable prices that anyone who is considering doing a live in-person test should absolutely run an iteration through remote testing first so they can fix stuff that comes up and get the most out of their live test.

ed_menac,"Business stakeholders always have an inflated sense of ego and brand. The reality is that users might be switching tasks, flipping between tabs, and not paying full attention to your website. In the worst case scenario, removing the logo has the potential to disorientate users who may not be keeping track of the sites they're using. 

Additionally, the logo often serves as site navigation. It's an escape button to shoot you back to the homepage. It's not just eye\-candy. It's a useful anchorpoint and navigational tool.

Removing your logo seems quite a baffling decision with few benefits. 

The only instance I'd see it being helpful to remove, would be on a very small viewport, where screen space is very precious. However, I would still expect a favicon, and the site identity to be available in a conventional place. 

The fact that there's no convention for sites to do this should be a warning flag. However your best defence is user evidence.

Axure was my first wireframing tool, so I have a little more patience with it than others might. I still think it does 'interactivity' better than any other tool.

However. Switching into Axure after a period of using other software (e.g. Illustrator, Figma, Sketch) is frustrating to the point of tears.

Just off the top of my head, here's some of my complaints:

* 'Lock' doesn't actually lock.

* Drilling into dynamic panels is hell.

* Steep learning curve on repeaters.

* Can't edit interactions on multiple widgets at once.

* Most basic web functionality/animation is laborious to emulate.

* Left align page as the default is annoying. The option to change it is hidden, and it applies on a page-by-page basis. WHY.

* Can't create a default webfont to be embedded on all projects. I literally just want our house font on my prototypes, but I always forget to drill into the publication settings to set it up.

* Responsive view is nigh impossible to find and unintuitive to use.

* Cannot import existing stylesheet/script. Means house styles have to be recreated by hand.

In general, it feels like I waste a lot of time working out how to 'hack' Axure so it creates the behaviour I want, which doesn't seem right. 

Even with the greatest library in the world, there will always still be functionality I have to create manually, and unfortunately Axure's UI really doesn't help the user to do that.

A few thoughts:

WCAG 2.1
I heard that they are working on a new version of the WCAG guidelines. Maybe you could analyse those in contrast to the previous ones. I am however unsure how much is already out there.

The easy path
A study design which is quite easy to conduct, would be to test whether accessible websites also benefit the non-challanged population (easy recruitment). I know a paper or two showing that accessibility helps all the users.

Usability Test
Maybe you could also conduct usability testing with elderly people on the website that your professor came up with. How easy is it really for them and are there aspects that WCAG do not cover?

The number of candidates I've found who really understand all aspects of UX and have the empathy and knowledge of people to be a good UX designer is much lower than the number of candidates who are applying for UX positions.

retirementyay,"At my previous employer we were constantly trying to increase the size of our team. We ended up hiring a few people directly out of bootcamps and it turned out okay in the end, but some of those people ended up being more successful in the job than others. The ones who did well typically had some related experience prior to going to the bootcamp, but this wasn't a hard and fast rule. There were so many people coming out of these camps at the time that it seemed like there was an unlimited number of junior candidates to choose from. In other words, the junior UX market was really saturated in my city. We ultimately moved away from the strategy of hiring out of bootcamps due to the amount of training and mentorship that was still needed by these people (we just didn't have enough senior resources to support so many juniors to the level needed) and the need to focus more on getting experienced practitioners. That said, it was always a struggle to get good senior- or mid-level candidates.

designerthings,"Sooooo if you’re totally green to tech and design I don’t think a boot camp will get you anywhere. And I went to one. It’s very high level and little practical skills.

Regarding oversaturation, the plain truth is the people complaining about that generally just aren’t good enough. 

At my last company (huge tech company that supplies most of the worlds computers), we had an all hands meeting and the design director said “there just aren’t enough people in ux, we can’t get them fast enough.” And my coworker said “then why does everyone say the industry is so saturated?” 

And the director said “that’s the thing. It’s absolutely saturated with people that want to get in to UX, but there are so few actual ux designers.” 

I’m sure my opinion will be unpopular here with the entry level demographic. But that’s the truth. They don’t fully grasp the core concepts. Or they can’t produce them. 

Personally I never thought once that the industry was saturated. I dropped out of community college and got my first job making nearly 6 figures for a huge tech company. Then I left and joined another. I had no background in tech or design. But I devoted my entire life to UX for 2 years first. I’m so happy in my career. Too many people I’ve seen expect it to come easy. It’s not. Or they don’t know when to quit. 

It sucks to say this, but it’s not for everybody. Not every person that wants to be can become an exceptional ux designer. I used to think they could, but so many people have proved me wrong and I’ve watched them struggle to break in for years. ",1527292081.0
EagleBW_2017,"Coming from the perspective of a person who just finished a bootcamp, I can speak pretty plainly about my unique experience. I was reticent to go into one but my wife’s alma mater has a reputable Continuing Education program which was offering one.

I took the leap last fall and just completed my 6 month program last week. I have spent almost 10 years doing Business Development in the Tech sector and had been planning and eyeing a change. I will give you some of the reasons why I took the class:

1. I had been considering making a move for a year. I work at a startup so we have a lot of opportunities to work on cross functional  projects and I got to shadow our UX/UI teams on some of their customer facing exercises and initiatives. I got the bug and it made me take stock of what I wanted to do.

2. I spent many months out of that year doubting this was even the right thing. I thought I wasn’t certified, who knew if I had design skills or would I even be up to the task and even if I did complete the course their is no guarantee I get a job.

3. After deciding I wanted it I decided how I wanted to learn. I found out quickly I follow along terribly online and in person feedback while learning was important to me. Plus I have a family so I needed something where I could juggle family, work and commuting in SoCal.

4. My cohort was amazing, our professor was challenging and our TAs were great as well. No one knows everything but we were willing to experiment and learn. Also our professor would call us out if anything we were doing was user centric and keep us honest about following a proper design thinking process. Always remembering to check your ego at the door and make it about the user.

5. The final third of the class focused on coding and luckily I had some HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills before I came in. One of the things I learned early on is that at times you will have to learn on the fly and get up to speed quickly so going into a bootcamp knowing more of what you will be doing for a job helps frame your experience.

6. I have been fortunate to have the help and mentorship of our Design Director as well as the opportunity to be critiqued by Senior UX Designers on his team. I have presented projects to our Design and product teams and I have participated in Hackathons that we have hosted. In addition to that, we had many opportunities to connect with industry professionals during my time in the camp and I have gotten great critiques on my work, honest feedback on my process and ability to get introductions to people hiring in their network when the time comes that I am ready to actively go after UX roles.

I don’t have a magic wand and I am not going to hit you with anymore buzzwords; what I do know is that preparation will make you successful. Going to a bootcamp doesn’t mean squat if you can’t defend your designs or talk intelligently about your portfolio or paint a picture of how your skill set will translate to help a design team solve new problems and help businesses solve core issues. 

What I took away was a pathway to continual learning. I have more work to do but I have portfolio with a site a coded myself without a template and some work that I have done that I am really passionate about and proud of. I hope you can find the same level of clarity in your journey. It won’t be easy to break in but to be honest jobs are harder than ever to land across the board so don’t let that discourage you.",1527282478.0

thrillandcreate,"I am a freelance UX consultant and would not, for a second, recommend freelancing in this field right now.

Simply put, I should be making more money than I was because I'm better at this kind of work now.  \(I've been in this business for over 6 years.\)   In reality, I'm making less money for several reasons:

* **Increased supply:** It seems like everyone, their brother, and their sister wants to be a freelance remote UX consultant now.  I think there is *a lot* of survivorship bias surrounding freelance success stories.
* **Flat \(or declining\) demand:** It doesn't seem like client demand is keeping up with this increase in supply.
* ""**UI/UX"" confusion**: A few years ago, there was a big debate about whether designers should code.  Now, I'm seeing this shift toward clients wanting designers who do all aspects of UX design except user research and with a strong emphasis on visual design.  I'm doing more visual design out of necessity, but I'm still a UX purist at heart.
* **More tire\-kickers:** This year, I think I've quoted almost as many projects as I ever have.  Two usual outcomes: the client defers the project indefinitely, or the client doesn't do the project at all.  I've started charging for customized quotes.
* **A weak professional network:** I'm still relying too much on job boards for work because I hardly ever meet people who can give me consistent qualified leads.

So why am I still freelancing?  Several reasons: 

* I have a recent past client with a lucrative enterprise project that should start within the next few weeks.
* I have to travel overseas for 5 weeks this summer and still need to be able to work during the trip.
* Onsite jobs in my field are just too far away from where I live.

There is nothing wrong with the hamburger menu, more menu or whatever menu, if you give it a thought and don't just put everything in there. That's just lazy and bad UX.

It's far more important to come up with the idea and plan how to structure and show all the information, instead of just blindly ditching or implementing hamburger menu. It largely depends on the complexity of the app or website.

Also, i have read and studied a lot of articles, alternatives and so on which some people recommend to use instead of hamburger menu. And you know what, most of them are really less useful than hamburger menu. Why? Because they think and showcase the solutions in ideal situations where you don't have more than 5,6 or so items, few features and so on. Ofc it's easy then, but try to ditch the menu in some complex apps or websites and most, if not all of these solutions wouldn't work. Both because the UX would be damaged or because of device inconveniences  \(like gestures\). Also, regarding the gestures which some people suggested to use instead of menus; that's not a good alternative because most of the people don't use them and don't know how to use them. It is far easier for users to see and tap on something, than to wave with hands in hopes the app will do what you want, especially elderly.",1527236284.0

modernboy1974,"This is one of those questions where context is key. You have to consider desktop vs. mobile and how many menu items are required for the application. My personal preference is that 4 or less menu items means the menu should be hidden on desktop or mobile. More than 4 menu items, for desktop the first pass should definitely attempt to lay out the menu options on the page so that users don't have to hunt for them. Of course it also comes down to priority of actions, what do you want the user to accomplish on the page. Do you want to push them in one direction and leave menu options as options? Maybe you hide the rest of the menu. With UX almost everything needs to be considered on a case\-by\-case basis. You can list out pros and cons for anything, but ultimately you have to make a decision that is best for the user and the end product. ",1527274381.0

Turd_Ferguson35,"Oh, I know a lot of about this.
 Source:  I am director of UX for a company that makes software to help companies be GDPR ready and compliant.

IP addresses can be considered, technically, personal identifiable information (PII) so if you are capturing and storing that, along with AN?y other bits of information, i would look into it and the process. You are correct, site cookie consent will change the UX of web and apps dramatically as a user has to explicitly(at least in the EU) opt into cookies at a category level, and in most instances allow a user to opt in/out at the subcategory level.  So if you are using a 3rd party software to track user behavior, this will be explicitly spelled out for the user.  I would also check into the services you are using to track, as they need to be compliant as well.  Are they compliant, what are they doing with the information collected on the data subjects, who has access, how is it stored.  In some instances the opt and consent will be a forced interaction.

Other giant items that will affect UX:
- Consent management at points of information collection (webforms, etc.) and notification of purpose of process at that time. So the functionality and information for these elements will need to be expanded.  this also means consent for filling out paper forms when doing in person user testing.
- subject rights and allowing the user 9 rights of access spelled out in Art.15
- Utilizing analytics not collected by your entity for purposes outside of the given consent purpose of process will now be illegal, i.e. can't buy data from someone unless that someone told the subject they were selling it to you.

Then I think about each page and which type of template it should take - is it a list type template, page detail template until you have a template count that fits within the budget.

Once you know what template a page will use you need to define what components will be needed on each template: header / sub nav / introductory component / wysiwyg component / hero feature / footer / etc

I then wireframe up what each main template will look like with a single set of components, if you have 5 templates you wireframe up 5 templates and maybe a couple of duplicates which have slightly different components. Each template can have a mobile / tablet / desktop view depending on your time and budget allocation.

This will give your dev and ui team a responsive template and component count to estimate time or build towards.

3 months ago I was tasked at work to design AND DEVELOP a website in one week! Seemed impossible. I started looking at some tools and found webflow. Webflow saved my ass. 

It's so easy to translate your design from sketch to webflow. I would recommend taking a day to watch a few hours of their tutorials and just messing around on their website. once you feel comfortable, you can design it in webflow. 

You know the best part? You can export your design's code (pro feature. must pay). HTML, CSS, JS, Assets, everything. and it's actually really developer friendly. 

I ended up passing the designs to the developer after I exported them and he had no trouble taking them off my hand for maintenance going forward. 

Oh, responsiveness. Right. Webflow does it really well. Just watch their intro tutorials. It's one of the best investments of my time and money in my entire design career to have learnt webflow, to be honest. I have already designed two websites that are 100% responsive with some really cool animations that trigger on a scroll and etc...

> Do you design each page individually for both mobile / tablet / desktop?

If you have components and templates for mobile/tablet/desktop, place them and resize them side-by-side. Look up ""mobile first design"", that will allow you to add features as you grow in size, rather than having to worry about taking things out if you start with desktop-first.

Designers don’t have to code. Only engineers think designers have to code. 

Ask yourself the reverse question: should coders know design? I don’t think they were educated for that. Just like a UX or UI designer isn’t educated on computer science.

They are two different disciplines, and have to work together. Think if other industries did this. Should flight attendants learn to pilot a plane? Should pilots learn how to attend to flyers? It might be helpful if you want to understand each other, but neither should be expected to do both. Their focus should be on their role. Imagine if a pilot was distracted by helping flyers, or if a flight attendant tried to pilot. A mess.

#Entry to ux


I was a Psychology graduate in my penultimate year when I was getting edgy about what I wanted to do. I knew I was interested in applying Psychology to some kind of customer-focused industry. I had looked into 'consumer psychology' but had reached a bit of a brick wall, and couldn't figure out how to progress as a Bachelor's graduate into that field.

At this time, I was reading a lot of job descriptions online and trying to feel out what real people did for real careers. One fateful day I came across a a guy purporting to be a 'Psychologist' for Valve, the computer game developer. I totally wanted that job!

So I emailed this guy asking for advice on finding a similar role. He was a total sweetheart and responded, explaining that this field was often called 'UX' and invited me to join a UX professionals group on Linkedin.

After this, I scurried off to do my research, reading bits about UX on the internet and quickly decided it was something I wanted to pursue.

I reached out to a few usability/UX agencies in cities near and far. Eventually, someone agreed to talk to me, and I volunteered to intern with them over my summer break before my final year. 

There were only 5 staff members at this research agency, and I was mostly just doing day-to-day work helping with office tasks. However, I got to watch the UX researchers at work and learn from them what UX was all about. I got experience hanging out with clients who were observing usability testing, and see how to consolidate findings into research reports. (Though a Psych student, my course was heavy on *quantitative* research, so qualitative methods were very new to me). In any downtime, played with the UX tools or read UX books from the shelf.

I was only there for 2 months, but I learnt a great deal, and my enthusiasm was such that after my university degree ended, I convinced them to hire me as a researcher full-time.

I worked here for 3 years, during which time I learnt much about the way people think, perceive information, and browse online. I never stopped reading or learning, and my Psychology background came in very useful. Because I was constantly doing face-to-face research interviews and writing up findings, I learnt how to be confident, how to ask questions in a non-biased way, and how to identify usability issues and address them.

Towards the end of my time here, I felt that I had learnt everything I could, and I really wanted to move out of pure UX research and focus more on creating designs.

It was very difficult to find somewhere willing to hire someone with no proven history as a designer. My best hope was to find a company hiring an in-house researcher, and perhaps segue slowly into a designer role from there.

After several months and many applications, I landed a jackpot role as a UX Designer working client-side with an existing designer who was seeking out a junior. I had to move across the country, but I'm still working there today, and it has been one of the best decisions I ever made.


#Best & worst of my job


The most fun part of my job is the variety. I have a very typical UX designer role. Some wireframing, some hi-fi graphics work, some prototypes, some basic UI code, regular research, and a lot of consulting and planning.


The hands down worst project for me was when our 2 major customer groups had vastly opposed needs and a lot of investment in a particular feature. It was a god damn *filter* on a search tool but Jesus it caused such a fuss! 


The internal stakeholders flip flopped around and basically prevented us from doing anything meaningful, and politics kept us from working in an agile way.


Eventually sense prevailed and we delivered a very basic MVP. What an anticlimax! 


Honestly it's hard to convey how much time and effort was expended on it over 2 years, just to get a tiny filter.

eltatuajefalso,"Not a full story, but I was finishing high-school in 1996 when internet started to become a thing people would have access to from home. I immediately wanted to learn how to write HTML. I mistakenly went on to study to be a Systems Engineer, hoping to learn more and more about technology. During my first semester I found a part-time job in which I needed to do some coding for actual websites, but design was kind of implied in whatever I did. I needed to make things work from a technical POV but also from an experience POV, at a basic level. Then I started to develop this interest in design. Coding started to feel “easy” and design’s subjectivity more and more interesting.

This totally changed the way I thought. made me become an active user of digital products. Instead of asking myself questions like “how was this coded” I started to think “why is this easy to use” or “how could this be easier to use”.

I kept studying for 2 more semesters and quit. It was pointless. There was nothing UX-related any university had to offer back then, So I just kept working, learning as I worked. At some point I went to
some kind of a design school and it felt boring at times, but it taught me the basics of design. I learned (and never forgot) how design is there to solve a problem, how it’s there to communicate. How a message or product needs to be crafted with the audience in mind, etc.

Then books and online training helped me understand at a deeper level HCI concepts I was kind of instinctively applying. This gave me an ever-growing foundation I’ve used to be a better designer and to be a better leader to other designers.

I’ve now been working in design for more than 20 years and I can’t see myself doing anything else.",1526824097.0
owlpellet,"I worked in journalism in the early 2000s, and was one of a few people at my org interested in figuring out how to make online journalism something other than a copy of the print newspaper. 

From there I ended up at a wonky research nonprofit, which got me exposed to a bunch of statistical methods and anthropology people. We were web-only and distributed team, which was still pretty rare then, and we kicked ass by using (and then building our own) cheap online collaboration tools. My role shifted to a toolbuilder, and I was pretty good at it. I just wanted to solve problems for people.

Then the Arab Spring happened and a bunch of people were relying on stuff I maintained, and everything was on fire. My mental health went to hell. I had to quit. 

I worked in ecommerce startups for a while, as a do-everything frontend coder, designer, product manager. All of them failed or were acquired for parts. I learned a lot and made about $30k a year. Lean startups, indeed. 

I got hired as a UX designer for a company that was growing. I found ways to be useful, mostly by getting our team to expand from ""what it looks like"" to ""what  people do with it"". The company went from 150 people to about 500 in two years. I am a director of product design, along with two others. We manage a team of ~20 designers. I am surrounded by incredibly talented people, building a product that helps people do their jobs better.

I already had a firm understanding of interactive design and the UX process but companies wanted to see X number of years on my resume solely as a UX designer which I didn't have.  Plus I was competing with other UX designers who have been doing it for a while plus UX boot campers. So I ended doing a lot of freelance UX work while I looked for a full time gig. Then one day I got my big break and landed a full time job working for a friend/former co\-worker at a pretty well known company. The rest is history.",1526837014.0
KaylaElain,"I didn't know it at the time, but I was engaging in UX when I was 10. I don't typically mention this to people in the industry, but I borrowed my mom's HTML/CSS book and memorized everything just so I could make cool pages for my Neopets. I also wanted to make graphics on something better than MSPaint, so I got Photoshop Elements for Christmas one year. Yes, Neopets is how I got started with design.

But like every precocious kid that grows up, the expectation is that you'll use your smarts to be a doctor or a lawyer. I completely bombed my first year of undergrad because I had intentionally taken as little science as possible while in high school. I appreciate the hard sciences, but chemistry makes no sense to me.

So the only other option was to become a lawyer. I switched my major to history and well, I still had no passion. I hated what I was doing, so I continued to bomb. My senior year of college, I had a strange thought about wondering who was in charge of making apps and websites look the way they do. I discovered it was part of a job called UX Designer and that I could get into the industry with a Master's in HCI. Luckily, my university had such a program. I e-mailed them back and forth, but I realized my GPA was below their requirement and let that dream die.

For a year after graduation, I was unable to find a steady job. I did not have money to relocate beyond my hometown and no one wanted history majors. I ended up working in a factory and I thought, ""Enough is enough. I want to be a freaking UX designer.""

But my GPA was haunting me and I had nothing for a portfolio. I decided to go down the expensive route--online courses with no financial aid. One of the branch universities of the program I wanted to get into had online Master's in HCI classes, so I got in as a non-student and took a full class load while working full-time. It was insanely hard. I was tired all the time. I ended up with 3 A+ grades. 

I put all the work from those courses into my portfolio, got the professors of those courses to write me a recommendation letter, and aced the Analytical Writing and Verbal Reasoning portions of the GRE. I had also talked to the director in-person a few months before and explained why I had a 2.7 GPA and how much I wanted to be there.

I got in, had a ton of trouble with the internship hunt, but it ultimately didn't matter. I'll be moving soon for an excellent job offer.

The most fun experience I had was probably just being in a Master's program where it feels more like family than soulless academia. People get to know you very well. People in my cohort would send me anything about Disney and design they found (I am a dork for Disney).

FloatyFish,"Graduated college in the middle of the recession, went to work in a law firm. 2 months in I realized it wasn't for me, so I took the GREs. Got a postcard from a school that mentioned HCI in passing. After looking at other grad degrees \(primarily urban planning\), I applied to the school & got in. Was originally going to go for the government policy specialization, but it got canned right before I got accepted. I seriously thought about declining, but then I did a cursory search for UX salaries, thought ""Eh, why not?"", and applied.

Went to school for 2 years, did 2 internships, worked with a PhD candidate on a paper, and then got a job. I wanted to do UX research, however I ended up getting a design position. That being said, I was able to do some research and that made me happy. I left that first job for a variety of reasons, and now I've bounced around with contract positions. 

Most difficult task was actually more of a difficult job. I worked at a place for \~6 months where the project scope was MUCH larger than they made it seem at first, and I really wasn't given the resources to complete it. Seriously, this was at least a 2 person job \(if not 3 person\), and it was basically dumped on me. Luckily, once that project ended, they kept me on for another 2 months to help with smaller projects, which I actually liked a lot better. The funnest experiences are the projects that I'm doing now. The first project has had some major press in my area, and I made the public facing website for it. The second project is for a new mobile/tablet app that will accompany some of our most technologically advanced products, so that's always exciting.",1526858871.0
edward-porter,"In college, I started learning magic tricks and got pretty into it, dove right into the advanced stuff. Through practicing and performing, I got a really good hands-on experience interacting with and understanding the psychology of most laypeople. Things like: what catches their attention, how their attention shifts, what sets people off, subtle psychological movements that might influence someone's choices, etc. Essentially, I spent a lot of time curating an experience for a targeted audience - which became the stepping stone over into UX. 

As a psychology major not interested in entering the medical field nor dealing with the politics of academia, I knew I was going to have to carve out my own lane as far as a career. Randomly found this subreddit, decided that this was what I wanted to do, and taught myself the fundamentals. A lot of the ideas, theory, and psychology from magic actually ended up crossing over into the UX world, so since my brain was already tuned to that way of thinking (user-centered approaches), I picked up UX pretty fast.

9 months later, I'm in a full time UX position and freelancing design for two other companies. Anyway, just thought I'd share a different type of story than what was already posted. If you're looking for my route in more of a professional sense, you can dig a little through my comment history to see the track.

MochiMochiMochi,"This is an interesting question because while UX itself as a discipline is not new, the industry awareness of the role is a new and evolving construct full of interesting history. As some here have said, you might already have been working in UX and not held the title. 

I've been working in a full time UX role since 2006, having transitioned from web design, which was itself a transition from graphic design. One could argue those roles are often assumed to be within the UX domain, albeit with different responsibilities; if I am doing visual design as a UXer, am I approaching the work the same way as a graphic artist? 

Mostly likely I would be, but as a UXer I might also be thinking about how my visual design fits within a digital design framework or accessibility guidelines, or a million other things. It's a bit convenient for our employers that we might get paid 40&#37; more with a UX title, but we could be doing the jobs of three different people. The company ends up with more skills for less money.

And that, unfortunately, is the defining trend of UX. I've been thinking about this a fair bit recently since I am hiring two people to join my team. This is the third time since 2008 that I've hired people, and the difference is stark. Masters degrees are commonplace now, and many applicants profess to be serious triple or quadruple threats, with solid experience in interaction design, visual design, information architecture and sometimes even research or front end development.

Naturally, I am skeptical. Not about their skills, but whether a UX role can sustain this level of simultaneous broadening and deepening of what's expected to hold the position, and whether these eminently qualified UXers will burn out at some point when management decides that unicorns are just goats with a horn.

Also, I'm encouraged to see folks posting here as UX researchers. I've only worked in one company in over 28 years of employment where I interacted with people doing UX research, so it's good to see that it's being funded, somewhere. 

To answer OPs questions, the most interesting project in the world can become a nightmare if it's not managed properly or has insane deadlines or faces impossible internal political hurdles.

Yes, cars in parking spots, but it was a beautifully managed team with good access to stakeholders who relished an opportunity to quickly iterate on creative approaches.",1526864170.0

I went to undergrad for a Bachelors in Economics and then worked for a year as a Financial Analyst. I was miserable. I hated it. During this time I decided to go back for my Masters in IT because I was interested in IT.

Prior to my Financial Analyst job, I worked several contract jobs and one of happen to be under a former CIO for CitiFinancial. I reached out to him for guidance (after having already started my Masters) and asked if he could refer me to anyone that could help me get my foot in the door outside the finance world. He referred me and I got brought on as Communication Analyst within Citi's IT group. About a month in I met a UX designer and finally realized that what I had done growing up (designing websites and apps for fun) was part of UX. From there I really just started doing online classes on Udemy, YouTube, and then just doing personal projects to build up my portfolio. About six months in I was brought onto the UX team as a UX designer and from there I have just continued this trajectory. 

Having said all that, for me the key to making the transition was networking. People are out there to help you and they want to help you. Most people feel good helping others! Having worked at big corporations like Citi and big 4 consulting firm, I do realize that going the route of General Assembly courses is a good option too. I know people poo-poo this idea but I think it works. But you should be aware that you have to continue learning.

Most difficult:
To this day, UX Research is super difficult for me. In fact, I hate it. I try to avoid it. I recently accepted this role as a Lead UX Designer and did not expect this much research so I believe my next move will be to get away from research and just do UI Design which is what I love.

Most fun experience:
The projects I have worked on are super cool. I have worked on a big global banking platform at Citi, a flights booking search engine site (freelance), a medical billing office application design (freelance), and platforms for the US Military that save lives! I think it's super cool. ",1532821990.0

DonHopkins,"It's the 30 year anniversary of CHI’88 (May 15–19, 1988), where Jack Callahan, Ben Shneiderman, Mark Weiser and I (Don Hopkins) presented our paper “An Empirical Comparison of Pie vs. Linear Menus”. We found pie menus to be about 15% faster and with a significantly lower error rate than linear menus!

So I've written up a 30 year retrospective:

This article will discuss the history of what’s happened with pie menus over the last 30 years (and more), present both good and bad examples, including ideas half baked, experiments performed, problems discovered, solutions attempted, alternatives explored, progress made, software freed, products shipped, as well as setbacks and impediments to their widespread adoption.

You may not need to expose them to the concept of a 'hub' or 'portal' whatsoever, and just use the name of the product, in which case your internal jargon is trivial.

It's one of those cases where the terms have different meaning depending on the context or organisation. For instance in my workplace, we have a \*lot\* of different nomenclature, but which doesn't necessarily have meaning to users or outside our company.

A simple piece of web software we call a 'tool'. A collection of 'tools' with interconnections within our ecosystem is referred to as a 'service'. A 'dashboard' is a high level repository of link to the various 'tools', as well as data summaries, and account settings.

A 'portal' for us has connotations with our legacy products and used to refer to a self\-contained tool which had no external linkage with other products \(unlike our current ecosystem\).

In our parlance a 'hub' is about \*information\* rather than \*interaction\*. A hub might contain articles, data or other information \- much like a simple 'landing page'.",1526541859.0

If you use scrollbars for your divs, your design is bad and you should feel bad.

-dillydallydolly-,"Sounds like your internal stakeholders care about aesthetic quality, which is a good thing! They might be fixated on the scrollbars right now, but there's probably other visual enhancements that they're pushing for that isn't supported by IE. Perhaps by releasing an enhanced version, this will push your users to upgrade to a modern browser? Not sure how your organisation is structured and what the technical constraints are. 

Here's a mental checklist you can run through:

- What is the cost of implementing these visual enhancements (time and money)
- What is the metrics of browser share?
- weight the cost vs benefit. If only 2% of your users use chrome, perhaps it's not wise to spend 100k on these non-cross- browser enhancements.
- What actual benefit to users will there be for this enhancement?
- Are there performance/usability/accessibility concerns for these enhancements?
- Is this a hill you want to die on?

that last question is key. In all organizations, design/product/business relationships have to be a give and take. Some issues are worth fighting for. Others, not so much. You may think that custom scrollbars are not worth the effort, but as long as you implement it properly and have graceful degradation, is this worth the fight?

You should definitely have one-on-ones with each of them and then talk to them as a group to get an idea of what they need as individuals and what they need as a team.

Read _The First 90 Days_, _The 27 Challenges Managers Face_, and _Extreme Ownership_.

brizardi,"In most organizations I've found that managing means having roughly three jobs:

1. Fostering professional growth and engagement in your reports. \(Understanding their motivations and aspirations, addressing bad feelings, fostering team morale, etc\).
2. Making sure your team is producing good work on a day\-to\-day basis that is valuable for the organization \(instructing in process or approach, doing design critique and review\).
3. Being an individual contributor yourself \(either as part of a leadership team planning for the future, or doing the day\-to\-day execution work alongside your reports\).

These obviously overlap quite a bit, but if I had any advice it's to understand that you have to devote energy to each of these jobs independently. If you do 2 and 3 but not 1 you risk having good team output work until your designers burn out or leave, if you do 1 and 2 and ignore 3 you may end up having to sell your team on work you don't believe in yourself, and so on.",1526433687.0

- Whatever things are preventing them from doing good work, I blow that thing up. Whatever it is, I'm their advocate and problem solver. 
- I help them get to their next thing. Whatever their hopes and dreams are, I get them thinking about how to get there, and help where I can.

Obviously in this use case, less time = better (look at how Amazon changes their entire UI once you go to checkout).

In my industry we also have experiences where people can educate themselves in financial literacy. In this case, the longer people are engaged means (generally) the more meaningful or impactful our content. Kind of like how wikipedia cross links articles so that you end up in a rabbit hole.

Be prepared for lots of resistance - despite what the world says founders STILL hate talking to users. 

The book Value Proposition Design is excellent and the canvas’ they use are great at getting people to do UX stuff quickly.

Don’t focus on the deliverables, focus on the value and getting *something* to test.

Startups often think UX = UI Design. If you let them have their way they’ll have you designing random screens and functionality all day - always try and get it back to the user and how that feature meets the persona goals (hint: they often don’t)

A lot of ideas start good and end up not delivering value or innovation. It’s your job to get it back to delivering value.

A lot of ideas start off crap but tend to evolve into better ideas - it’s your job to get them to focus on the customer (not just the user!) and their pains / gains.

Even more ideas start off crap and end up crap. This is usually because someone is trying to hop on a trendy technology and throwing shit against the wall (“it’s a chatbot for sofa shopping”) It’s your job to be the gatekeeper here and if they can’t demonstrate real user need you need to warn everyone in your team.

ed_menac,"Hey I'm going to be a bit lazy and link you to a previous comment I've made, since much of it should apply to you:

[Find it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/77i6qe/Where_to_get_started_for_someone_getting_into_UX%21/dooceyf/)

With that said, it sounds like there is a lot you still don't understand about the UX industry, so I'd suggest you go and do a bit of reading.

Despite how people insist there is an enormous division between UX and UI, the reality is that it depends entirely on where you are and what you do.

In a terribly reductionist nutshell, UI is designing and coding the interface itself. UX is the study of how a user interacts with that interface.

So regardless of which one you're trying to do, the other is always relevant, and important to understand.

However in terms of jobs, it will depend exactly where you are as to how much of your job is purely UI versus a mixture of UI and UX work. Many pure UI jobs may be listed as developer jobs (since you'll primarily be mocking up and coding). Smaller teams may hire a hybrid UI-UX to do both, or simply to pay lipservice to UX.

You said arty and creative. That's great, and sometimes UI work can be fun and exploratory. However, you need to understand that the UI is there to serve the user. If creative and visually expressive is what you want, perhaps graphic design is more what you would be interested in (more on that further down).

However, as an engineer, I'm going to make an assumption problem solving is more your thing? Well that's exactly what UX UI design is about. Understanding user problems and technical limitations, then applying lateral thinking, knowledge and creativity to produce a solution. Then testing your solution and iterating it again and again until it's meeting your requirements.

I like to think of it similar to buildings architecture. You're not just creating a superficial artwork, you are creating a real life solution that people have to live and work with. You need to understand their requirements and build to their specifications, however unlike architecture, you can rebuild as many times as you need to get it right.

Contrast that to someone painting a mural on a wall. They are able to be very creative and expressive, because their product has no value other than it's visual appeal. Unlike the architect they don't have to worry about practical implications beyond the skills and materials needed to complete their vision.

Lastly, regarding your social anxiety. I'm afraid that isn't traditionally compatible with UX for the reason that you will need to be interacting with users and have a good deal of empathy and understanding for their needs. That's not to say introverts can't be great UX designers, in fact a passive personality and ability to listen can make some of the best UX workers of all.

However if talking to people and thinking about people isn't your think, I'd recommend you stick to developer skills and seek a more technical role in a company which already has UX provisions.

Anyway I feel like I have babbled on, and perhaps not answered your initial post. Please ask if you have questions, I'm happy to answer.",1526197928.0

metasophie,"> As I said I'm interested more in the ui field especially mobile app medium but in the job postings, I don't see much ui designers but most of them are ux/ui designers. Are we expected to do the job of both ux and ui area these days? I guess ux is more lucrative?

Ideally, UX/IxD people should be able to apply their skills to problems that are not confined by a Graphic User Interface. 

UX/IxD as an industry is complicated. There are really three parts to the industry: 

* People who inform their design through ethnomethodologically sound principals (user research based UX/IxD)
* People who inform their design from best business practices (Business Analysis UxD)
* People who inform their design from their emotion and what they think will work (Graphic Design based UxD)

The problem with the UI industry is that it is highly competitive. Many people unfairly believe that Graphic Design is easy and they can get their 16 year old neighbour who's ""good with photoshop"" to do that. Many Graphic Designers see an overlap of what they did with UX/IxD and jumped ship. 

This means that the community is fragmented on what we actually do. It's so bad that the term User Experience Design is considered by some ethnomethodologically based designers to be an incredibly poor choice because designing people's is fairly utilitarian in nature and is an example of designers with a poor background/education in the field ruining everything.

That being said, good graphic/visual designers are still in demand and still have the capacity to have significant influence in businesses. A lot of their career path is about creating a narrative from their work that tells a story of informed design and how it impacts aesthetics it's follow on impacts to brand, awareness, experience, and etc. 

> As paying off student loan, paying big money for going bachelors in ux or bootcamp is not really option for me now so I'm thinking of going self-taught which seems harder. I'm thinking of first taking this edx courses which are free or paid if you want to be certified.

I can't speak for the US but in Australia UX/IxD is hot enough that nobody really cares about your degree background, they really only care about your talent. We haven't progressed to a point in time that there are enough talented people who all have on topic degrees. So, I would be more focused on how do you gain the experiences required to learn whatever profession you want to master and move on from there. The fact that you have most of a degree should give you most of the analysis and learning skills that you would need to master most vocations given time. 

Some of that time might be useful to do those courses but I am not sure I would pay up for the certification until you understand what you are paying for. I would however use some time to work with low level creators who are trying to get ahead in the world and work with them to master the skills you learn online. I would hire somebody with half an engineering degree and has built up a pool of experience working with start ups and art creations and has a strong portfolio than somebody with a related degree who has never applied their craft outside of an assignment. 

> Is it unreasonable to finish studying and get portfolio ready at the end of this year and start applying?

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

> As someone's who's an introvert and have some social anxiety, would this career still be a viable plan? I still wanna break through and hopefully this will change me personally as well.

Most design disciplines have to present their work to clients. Not being able to do this is a significant barrier to long term potential. Although, this is largely true of any client facing role. 


> Any advice you could give me other than the courses I've provided?

Work with early stage creators (startups, designers, artists) and help craft and hone your skills in that environment to give you a meaningful anvil to forge your mastery on.

Amenra7,"Hey everyone, this is my first draft from a personal project I'm working on, a home bartender's cocktail book. Instead of posting all of the same recipes everyone else does, I'm focusing on the ""Mr Potato Head"" concept of recipe creation. The idea is simple, if a Daiquiri is rum, lime juice and syrup, you swap the rum for gin and you get a Gimlet, swap the gin for tequila and you get an old school Margarita, and on and on. Swap the rum for aquavit and you get something homegrown.  

This is important because having too much acid vs. sugar and you get a very unpleasant drink and visa versa. Flavors come later in the book, but these blueprints are the starting point.

I'm attempting to collect a handful of key classic and modern classic recipes and focus on reusing their construction as a simple guide to create new cocktails. I've posted the Lime Sour page, but there will be about a dozen of these to cover Lemon, stirred up, stirred rocks, sour rocks, orange, amari forwards, etc.  

I will also lead in with additional context about what constitutes a ""wine"" and ""interesting"".  

I would love some feedback about how easy this is to read and work with. Is it at all interesting? Is it pretty effortless to get the concept?  

I'll buff it up in later iterations, but the real mechanics are in these ratios and if they're usable. Please don't pull any punches in the feedback, also I'm a product manager with no experience as a visual artist.",1526150045.0
foxic95,"Custom tags wouldn't be very easy to keep track of (if you want them to be search-able and/or categorize-able). It's kind of like the Instagram hashtags that people use; if a concept can be formulated in multiple ways people are bound to do that, even when in reality they are referencing the very same concept. Instagram solved that by showing the most popular tags that are similar to what's written, which I think works great. It does amass a lot of cluttering hashtags with the same essential value, though. Just bear in mind that these tags are chosen by the posters of the content, not the viewers. Might still work. Kind of sounds like a shortened version of a regular commenting feature, though. 

Regarding the Steam tag system - the way I see it - it's basically an upvote (useful) and downvote (not useful) system with a third option since people like being funny, even though they're meant to be reviews. I see the ""funny""-option as saying ""this is not a real review, but in a positive way"". Anything that would be saying ""...not a real review, but in a *negative* way"" could use the report-feature. So, in a way, Steam is using a four-option system.

This is not based on any sources or anything like that. Just my piece of mind. ",1526151532.0
metasophie,"One of the things that I wonder about with rating systems is what do they even mean to clients. We know with the Likert Scale that people rarely use it in a way that makes sense statistically. I mean, mathematically I'd think that 3 on a 1-5 system should mean that it is average but we know that anything less than 4 means it's a terrible product. 

Same thing with a tag based solution. What does a positive ranking + `#fun #openworld #rpg #fps` really mean? What does it mean to you? What does it mean to me? Would that game be fun for me if I like games that are rpgs even though I prefer third person views? If people could ""upvote"" #fps what would that mean? What if the game was both #fps and #tps would one be a higher value than the other? 

This is why rating systems do my head in and why I almost always differ to what pattern my users want during testing, even if they aren't the best interactions or experiences. 

> What if there are no options at all and the users can mark any post with a custom tag? 

Back in the early days of the web, designers used to ask people to enter what country they were from. This wasn't an option list it was just write your country name. 

I saw a country name table that had over 50,000 unique entries. About 1/3 of those were different ways of writing and misspelling Australia or different cities/suburbs in Australia (it was an Australian business). To improve the process from all ends designers moved to an option where the they created scaffolds that support the users entry (fixed options) 

I'd imagine that custom tags would share a related problem. #fpsrpg #fps #rpg #rpgfps #fsps ... you get the point. 

> Do users tend to use such systems ""the right way""

I know I am taking this fragment out of context but I think the wording here is really interesting wording. So, I'm just addressing the wording as an interesting tangent and not  your specific argument. 

If this was a question about how users interact with systems in general then we should assume that the answer would be no; users do not use the system ""the right way"". I'd go as far as to say that if non-malicious users aren't using the system ""the right way"" then the designer is at fault and not the user. This is why this field exists. To research how users use the system and improve those interactions which in turn improve experiences. 

> What if there are no options at all and the users can mark any post with a custom tag? If this is used e.g. in a social network, would some very common tags eventually emerge, or would most users use unique tags?

Even if you got common choices I'd worry that without moderation or some sort of way to correlate different tags into a taxonomy then statistically it won't be of any value and that's one reason why businesses rate things, so they can understand how their products compare against each other. 

edit:

The same thing goes for freeform tags that are deemed common enough to be wrangled.

* Very fixed number of hours.
* No/minimal custom development required.
* The work has to go live.
* No additional revisions allowed.

Case in point: I had a pro bono project which scope-crept through several additional revisions.  My role grew to include not only extensive custom development but also a whole separate site which I had to code from the ground up.  The client didn't use a huge piece of the work.  

When I decided to revise that project as a side project more recently (nearly 5 years later) because my portfolio had gone out of date thanks to a lot of NDA work, I gave myself these constraints:

* One iteration of copywriting, then wireframing, then a visual design mockup.
* Only the homepage, not a whole site.  (This did include both mobile and desktop.)
* 8 hours, max, for everything.  I finished this whole project in 2 afternoons.

>However, I currently work in digital marketing and I hate it – is working as a UX designer/researcher anything like marketing?

Yes. Yes, working in digital marketing is exactly like working in UX **IF YOU ARE WORKING IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT.**

Corporate jobs are corporate jobs. There is *some* variation among corporate cultures. But for large corporations of a certain size (say over 1000 people), they're all the same: Hot messes full of politics, frustration, and good intentions, with the ever-present threat of a sudden re-org eliminating your ""soft"" job in UX.  That's just real life.

Working for start-ups is very different and varies a GREAT deal more from start-up to start-up. Working for NGOs and non-profits is a different experience altogether. And perhaps the hardest but most fulfilling? Being a self-employed UX practitioner. 

My point is this: where you work is as, if not more, important as what you do. Professional fulfillment comes from far more than picking the right graduate path. 

>What I’m really interested in is research (I have a degree in English Literature so I love writing long essays)

Whoa, whoa. This is NOT what UX Research is about. If anything, the heart of effective research is succinct, pithy, visual communication. NO ONE in the real world is going to read long, rambling research reports. If that's what you want, better to go into academia where, in fact,  you can write discursive, wide-ranging lit reviews to your heart's content.  

>I need to feel like I’m doing something useful, intellectually challenging, something where I can continuously improve, solve problems, and do things that have a positive impact on people.

This is what EVERYONE wants. Literally, everyone. Please take a look at *Drive* by Daniel Pink (or see the Self-Determination Theory it's based on).  This comes from pursing your passion at a place that allows you to pursue your passion in a way that fits you. You are not ""committing"" to UX by doing an HCI degree. You are making a choice. If it feels like the right choice, please do it. No one here can tell you what your experience will be like on the other side. We're not you.

plastictosh_,"Similar to you, I used to be a graphic designer working in the digital marketing arena \- much of my work was creating brand campaigns that run across social media. I switched jobs to a UX consultancy, and at least for me, it was one of the best decisions I have made career wise. 

What you mentioned about continuously improving, solving problems and having a positive impact on people \- that falls at the crux of UX design \(although the positive impact can be misleading: I'll get to that in a bit\). In fact, as I've grown more into my role as a UX Specialist as opposed to a visual designer, much of my work revolves around understanding a business space, speaking to both users and clients in depth to understand requirements and managing information disclosure. There have been many instances where the final outcome of my work would not be screens but reports to the company providing suggestions and recommendations on how to improve their services. 

Within the UX industry, you will in fact get the chance to grow in multiple directions \- it could be in the designing of better interfaces, or towards the research angle \- where you will be expected to interview users, test products and possibly even conduct ethnographic studies of your users. To that end, I do believe you would find switching to UX quite fulfilling. 

About the positive impact on people caveat though, given the rise in the field, you may find that companies \(and consultancies\)  are solving problems towards helping achieve certain metrics \- less clicks, more engagement, customer turnovers etc as opposed to helping improve customer's lives. Then again, that is the nature of industry. If you're working in\-house for a product, this could be avoided as your role would be to better a product as opposed to pleasing a client \- though working on the same product for extended periods can also get boring. 

Hope this helps. Best of luck! :D",1525907095.0
IronOmen,"It can be great....if.

The reason I say it that way is that when your working in house so much depends on the teams you work with and the projects that you’re on. Sometimes teams will have experience with the merits of user centered design and why it matters; but if they don’t you can find that most of your effort can be spent evangelizing UX or trying to set up the program for the company. I’ve been down both paths.

The introvert issue is manageable. You will have to be out with users on some level unless they put you in a UI position and call it UX. I still truly feel that the two main qualities you need are empathy and perseverance.

alilja,"this article feels shallow; this is literally _your job_ as a designer. you have to design for errors of all kind including omission and commission; it's not enough to create an ideal flow and call it a day, you also have to handle mistakes the users will make and figure out the best way to get them back on track.

in my experience (medical devices), 10% of the job is creating a nice, usable interface, and the other 90% is figuring out all the ways someone could do something wrong with it and then figure out what the correct solution is. usually this is simple but occasionally it can dramatically shape how an interface works. where i currently work, we create multi-thousand-data-point databases that contain all the possible errors that could occur, their severity, likelihood, mitigation, and links to how those are actually executed.

this is not a simple thing to do, which is why we get paid to solve these problems. it requires a deep understanding of the user's intent and flow so you can figure out not only what the best solution is most of the time, but what the solution might be for a small subset of users or usecases. often i find designing for these edge cases _first_ to be the best way to create an interface that works for everyone, but only if i don't lose track of the bigger picture.

>If we start our design process with a deep consideration of multiple scenarios, it turns out to be a lot less work on the long run.

the only way you can effectively do this is if you know what your user needs. not a guess, actual knowledge — from user research. so many UX articles claim to lay out what you need to do in all cases, but without knowing your users and their needs, you cannot design an effective interface. 

> When we see users entering the wrong format in a field it’s usually a good indication that some field-hint, an auto format or some code that gracefully strips non-numeric characters might reduce these mistakes.

this is just _one potential reason_ they're entering data that way; forcing them to enter data in a specific format may actually break the interface for them. here's a small hypothetical, based on my own experiences: an ID field is intended to only accept numeric data, but you find users are constantly entering text in it. without doing any research you may believe this is a mistake and lock down the text. but what if users are using this field as notes, or passing data back and forth to each other across applications with it? 

> No matter how sophisticated and realistic our usability tests are, there is some degree of artificiality to them.

it is literally my job to assess an interface's safety-related errors in a test environment as close as possible to real life usage — if you are blaming bad data on the ""artificiality"" of the scenario, you're either trying to cover something up or your tests aren't capturing what you really need.

i think the thing that sums up my issues with this article is the author's discussion on gmail:

>On the other hand, GMail does a better job of providing what the exact maximum file size is, and simultaneously providing an alternative for such scenario. You can then decide to “Cancel, I have a file of 24MB”, or “Cancel, I will give the video to the recipient via a flash drive”, or you can just proceed with the alternative without cancelling.

the interface win here is not that the user can cancel the upload. the win is that the designers understood that a) when attaching files, users aren't paying attention to filesize (but file size is a factor in actually being able to _send_ an email); b) users don't have good solutions if a file is too large; c) users don't care how a file gets to the recipient _as long as it gets there_ and then they built an interface that handles all of those needs automatically.

development_of_tyler,"They'll most likely have copies of your resume on hand and will have access to your portfolio, unless specifically requested I wouldn't worry about bringing your work with you.

The questions will be along the lines of:

* What's your UX process like?
* How do you approach problems?
* What are some examples of UX work you have done, and what were the outcomes? Why did you make those choices?
* What is, in your opinion, the most important characteristic for a UX designer?

So be prepared to talk about your design/iteration/validation process, and how you problem solve. Pull some specific examples of UX work you've done, preferably with measurable outcomes, and be prepared to explain what the problem was, how you solved it, and why you solved it that way.

And for the last question, you should be honest with what you think - but a hint is that, in my experience, the preferred answer is ""Empathy."" You have to be empathetic to your different users and what they are trying to achieve, why they are struggling, how they are uniquely using the product, and how you might go about solving the problem. It's not about you, it's about the customer. Set your ego aside and work to solve the problem, not build something fancy.

Hope that helps!

P.S. A good book to read for preparation would be [The User Experience Team of One: A Research and Design Survival Guide](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/the-user-experience-team-of-one/).

but a big part of it is understanding not just _what you do_ but _why you make the decisions you do._ anyone can see the experience and projects and outcomes, but this is an opportunity for them to get inside your head and your process and understand what makes you tick. it's not just ""we made this decision because of the feedback we got on x study,"" it's more like ""why did you think study x was valuable and useful? why did you rely so heavily on it?""

1. **you have done the work they're hiring for:** Your portfolio. Your case study presentation
2. **you can understand a complex design process..without losing sight of the project. :** Pick something you did really well and walk them through your process. Talk about any research and analysis, design strategy, technical execution. Keep the rest of your presentation simple. You're telling a story, keep the narrative succinct. It says a lot about your communication skills.
3. **You are a good listener:** pay attention, be vulnerable, be comfortable. I could go into detail about this but I'll hold off.
4. **You are not crazy and people enjoy working with you:** Don't be crazy and smile enough. Not too much. That's too much! Okay, perfect.

If this is the case, I involve stakeholders in the initial unpacking for a sprint, so they can understand what of their concepts are going to be tested this week, and to observe the testing, so they can see first hand how users interact with their concepts.

You'll probably get some worthwhile insights if you go further and pay. You can set screener questions to get closer to your target demographic. You rate the subjects (like Uber) so they tend to be good at following your written instructions and thinking out loud.

What it lacks, along with similar online services, is the ability to get deep insights. There's really no substitute for being there in person and being able to spontaneously follow a line of questioning when the subject says/does something intriguing.

It's a tradeoff. In exchange for not having to find subjects and perform the tests yourself, you get less useful test results. I imagine other online tools are similar in that regard.

In history technology was designed as a tool for humans, man + machine. Later it changed to technology as brain, so it had to be smart, information based. The big change now is that we're living inside the computer. With IoT,Cybernetic systems, there no longer is a choice to participate, since public space itself will be a designed product. So this changes how it is designed.

""The 1st Paradigm.
The situations that drove the initial system design were
classic examples of “critical incidents” [10]. The Air
Force realized they needed to quickly gain the pilots’
attention. At the time, all pilots and fight controllers
were male, so someone had the bright idea of using a
woman’s voice so that it would be immediately identified
as the “emergency voice”. This was clever and
worked well.

The 2nd Paradigm.
Of course, thinking about it terms of information theory,
this not only reduced errors (a fundamental value
of the 1st paradigm), it transmitted information more
efficiently. It is easy to see that there could be a taxonomy
of voice types created based on cognitive load and
response times.

The 3rd Paradigm.
From the outset, there were design issues based on the
meaning of this approach. The particular female voice
was reputed to have been selected for its sultry and
seductive tone. This quality reinforced the idea of the
space of the cockpit being “male,” echoed in movies like Top Gun. Of course, as women became flight control lers and pilots, this 1st and 2nd paradigm strategy
ceased to be effective. It also caused interface designers
to explore new meanings of the gender of the voice.""

Accept it and let that need for perfection go.

Once it's done, what you can do to improve your protocol :

-Pre-test it. I'd say, if you have only one thing to do, it's that one. Find colleagues if you are lucky to have some and ""test your test"".

-Be sure your questions are open. It's a given but I've seen this one failed more times than I can count. You can add answers to help you with the analysis, here an article I like about scales
https://measuringu.com/scale-points/

-To be sure your answers are being ""answered truthfully"" is one of the hardest part. If you pay your participants, they have an incentive to participate, that's a social bias right here cause they will want to be seen as ""good participants"".
If you don't pay them, they just might get bored, and answer whatever answers they want, since they don't care.

I'd say to be sure though, ask a lot of participants, way more than you actually need and ask several questions about the same topic rather than just one.
For example, if you are on the topic of holidays, you could ask once ""How many times a year do you go on holidays"" and later ""Last year, how many holidays did you go on""
You could check both those answers and weed out the dirty, dirty liars.

Hope that helps !

juneaftn,"There are very few evidence based tools in UX. It is a pity. When it comes to interviewing, the evidences are scarcer. However, there are some evidences you can borrow from related domains.

It has been shown often that people can tell a lie easily consciously or unconsciously when it's tenseless or it's about the future. However, it requires a lot more cognitive energy to tell a lie about the past because of conflict effect. So usually, asking the user to tell you about the past is a much better strategy even if you want to know more about their future.

For asking unbiased questions, I'd recommend open questions. Yet, you need a great amount of practice to ask a real open question. You can make a question more open even if you think it is open already.

To figure out how the users react to your questions(interview or survey), I recommend cognitive pretesting/interviewing(but don't confuse it with a witness interviewing skill, which is also useful for UX interviewing). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_pretesting

One thing to be cautious is asking a sequence of questions is itself biasing. It makes the user to be passive to the interview. A great interview needs less questions. The user might think it wasn't an interview at all, and instead he would think it was a nice conversation. Have a look into psycotherapy and psycolinguistics for more info.",1525093449.0

But tbh, asking your users what they want isn't always smart. Since, most people don't know what they want. You need to test them, and let their behavior speak. Companies have lost millions, by listening to their costumers in the wrong way.

A very good example is with coffee. If you ask someone how they like their coffee, usually they'll say: Strong and black! Few will say: Weak, sweet and milky, even though that's what you'd discover with different test methods. If you asked something 20 years ago, that they'd be using a mobile phone, they'd laugh at you.

Pynchon101,"A product backlog is a prioritized list of improvements, features and defects that a product team needs to complete over a period of time.

When an improvement, feature or defect is identified, it is logged in what many teams might refer to as a ticket. These tickets may vary in complexity or in the amount of effort or time that it takes for an engineer to implement them.

Product teams are limited in size, and because you want a team to be able to communicate and coordinate with each other easily, it's in an organization's best interest to enforce this limit.

As a result, a Product team can't throw unlimited resources at a list of tickets that need to be completed. They can only work on a limited number of tickets at one time.

On top of that, not all tickets are created equal. Not only do they vary in terms of complexity or time required to complete, but they also vary in terms of importance. How much value does an individual ticket bring to the product or organization?

Additionally, you might not even be able to work on a ticket right away, since it could be impeded by another ticket that must be finished first.

A Product Owner \(or a Product Manager\) is responsible for getting feedback from engineers to determine ticket scope. These conversations can also help identify dependencies between tickets. A Product Owner must also interface with other stakeholders, customers and various forms of data in order to assess the importance or value of a ticket. Once they've assessed all of this information, they will prioritize \(i.e. order\) all of the tickets that need to be worked on into a long list. This is the list the engineering team uses to determine what they should work on next.

This list is a product backlog.",1524937864.0
RetroEvolute,"The product backlog is a concept from scrum, so definitely read up on scrum and that should help you better understand what they're asking for. Organizations often run scrum a bit differently from one another, so after understanding the concepts, compare it to how your business is doing things to really piece it all together.

In this case, the product backlog is just a list of all the stories (or epics and features) that go into making the product. Depending on the size of the company, you may have multiple product backlogs for different products. 

If your organization doesn't yet have the user stories outlined (usually a product owner handles this with some consulting from the teams - backlog refinement, vetting), then make sure to figure out the expectations and if you're the one being tasked to do that.

If so, think about all the capabilities that the product is supposed to have. From a UX perspective, this may be more on the epic or feature level. You'll then form epics, features, and user stories in the form of ""As X USER, I want to DO Y THING so that/because Z PROBLEM IS SOLVED."" The ""X USER"" part is where the different role perspectives, or personas, come in. 

Once you have those epics, features, and stories outlined, you can begin prototyping each one, running usability tests across any combination of them, etc.

In a typical agile workflow, and as is the case with scrum, you don't usually do everything up front, either. That's what we call Waterfall, and it should generally be avoided as it leads to wasted work and resources. Scrum runs in what we call sprints, most often in two-week increments, where you commit to the work you'll get done that Sprint, meet every day with your team to run down what you've completed and will be working on that day, and at the end of the Sprint you demo the work completed to the product stakeholders, and then follow it up with a team members only retrospective on what went well and didn't go to well. The team agrees to make a tweak or two to improve any issues from that Sprint, and then it all starts back over.

It's all about incremental progress, and if you ensure that epics, features, and user stories are properly prioritized and always deliver value to their personas within their own scope, you can begin handing off development work before you're even fully done designing the product.

Project management software can help you keep this stuff organized and structured as your prototypes can be tied to an epic, feature, or story alongside it's acceptance criteria, testing details, etc basically keeping all relevant and useful information to building each piece of the backlog together.

The_Impulse,"A backlog is a list of tasks that have to be done for building a product or a feature. Since you are talking about user stories, I think you'll have to create a list of those for the product or feature that you are developing.

An example: let's say that you have a IxD Diagram for a user uploading a photo to show to his friends. The User Story should be something like ""As a user, I want to upload a photo to the app so I can share it with my friends"".

Imo as ux designer

So long as it your standard professional cover letter. Frankly I don’t care about the cover letter so long as it’s not unprofessionally written. You know the obvious stuff, too long.. spelling mistakes etc.. 
But the thing is someone from HR is usually the one reviewing cover letter and resume and doing the cultural interviews first.. if the candidate doesn’t feel like a good cultural fit the cover letter and resume  doesn’t get into the hands of a ux person.

If he cultural interview is all good, then the Sr. Ux person will get your resume..  but at this point I am wayyyy more interested in your portfolio or case studies.. The cover letter receives very little of my focus.. other than like..your name lol 


So, my advice is to make a strong cover letter someone from HR would enjoy.  HR folks aren’t often experts in the field and not overly technical. Most of the time they receive a high level checklist from the ux team of what skills they must have..  and often it’s like 

1.	Use sketch, figma, Invision
2.	has done prototyping 
3.	knows agile 
4.	jira experience 

And they parse will just search your cover letter and resume for those words lol so the more you can align with their checklist then better your chances are and you will get that cultural interview.

I’m sure some ux designers interviewing you will care a lot about your resume. But I’m more of a “show me what you got “ guy lol

I speak however from only my experience, I’m sure others will give you good advice that differ. 

Hope that helps

* For the love of god, do not start your letter with “my name is.” That is literally the least interesting thing about you and also I probably have already seen it in your email header.
* Start selling yourself from the first sentence. What is most interesting about you? Why do you really want this job? Often you can write the letter, cut the first paragraph of garbage you wrote, and start with the second graf.
* Assume no one is reading your letter super carefully. Don't bury useful info in the last sentence of a paragraph in the middle of the page. Write it so that when someone is scanning it quickly, they will see what you want them to see.
* Figure out the name of the hiring manager and write the letter to that person. If you treat this like you are writing a letter to the giant anonymous HR database in the sky, you will be treated that way by the robots.
* If you have any sort of personal connection, put that up front. If it's a job you really want, try to make a contact at the company before you apply, so you can say ""I met Schmelbert at this networking event.""
* Focus on the goals and challenges of the organization more than your own interests and goals. Don't say things like ""I want to learn at GameDevCorp so I can learn things and meet cool people."" That's a given, what can you do for them?
* Sound excited about the job! Over the years, I hired many people who were, on paper, way less qualified than other people, but who were able to sincerely and genuinely communicate why they wanted that job. It can make a real difference if you mean it.
* That said, assume that if you are applying for a job in gaming, there are lots and lots of other people just like you applying for the job.

kylorhall,"With enough contrast, a background color is a suitable distinction to a button, in my experience.  Users may not know what the color it is, say, green, but they will know it has a background – it doesn't become transparent.

There's a handful of things you can change on your browser or computer to run through and emulate it, eg. set a `body { filter: grayscale(100) }` and see what happens – can you still tell it's a button or link?  If not, what do you have to fix that?

With material, as long as you don't overlook contrast, if I can tell it's a button or link, the hover / focus / click states are fine to me, so just avoid the ghost / no-background buttons and most buttons should be fine.

I agree on links though; using blue text with no underline or other distinction inline with other text is not enough to signify a link, but it's not even close to uncommon, perhaps even the norm.  Look on this sidebar – a fair bit of users would not be able to tell that the links are links without hovering over them.  This isn't a Material problem.",1524814925.0

I don't find much cause for concern that that a person with poor vision (color deficient or otherwise) but not using a screen reader could not differentiate the link text from the surrounding text. The #3949AB over #fff hits a ratio of 7:1 so you're only going to have issues on a darker background. And as far as I can tell it's only used on interactive elements.  Anyone using a screen reader would have the link announced to them. 

If you wanted to enhance this a bit I'd just use a heaver font-weight and underline on hover.

ristoman,"Honestly, it's a bit more about mentality. Nowadays you have a gazillion tools to help you get there and it comes down to personal preference and appropriateness for the task.

1. Get out of the building and put your work in front of people. The earlier you can express an idea on paper and see how potential user or random people feel about it, the better. Testing it on yourself doesn't count. It will never be perfect, but it can be good enough to get feedback and iterate.

2. Be outcome driven. Why are you interested in building what you're building? How do you expect people to interact with it? What would success look like? Is it measurable? If you can't measure it, you can't understand it.

3. Learn to avoid leading questions. User research is super tricky and is easy to bias. Asking ""How good is this?"" and ""How does this make you feel?"" makes a huge difference (you want the latter).

4. Work smart, not hard. If you can get feedback in one day, it's preferrable to having a polished thing a week later. Again, boil it down to the key elements. The rest is decoration.

5. Last but not least, you will never have all the answers. Humans are unpredictable, have short attention spans, and will avoid instinctively anything they don't understand. They will say one thing and do another. This can either destroy you or you can accept it and stick to experimentation and hard data.

I’ve read books such as the famous “Don’t make me Think”, “100 Things Every Designer Needs To Know About People”, and “Usable Usability”. I’ve also taken a couple courses entitled “UX Fundamentals” on Udemy.

But, if you’re looking to switch into a career in UX, employers will be looking for actual portfolio pieces and/or education credentials (assuming no professional experience in the field yet). ALBEIT, books and online courses will definitely build an understanding of UX, but are only valuable if the knowledge is applied.

In my mind, education is the easiest path (with clear, defined guidelines) to bring you closer to a UX role.

[http://www.asb.dk/fileadmin/www.asb.dk/isek/christoffersen\_moller.pdf](http://www.asb.dk/fileadmin/www.asb.dk/isek/christoffersen_moller.pdf)

**Abstract**

>It is a challenge to the elderly to manoeuvre in today’s ICT society, where the command of technology plays an increasing role at all levels. On the one hand, age\-related impairments may infl uence the ability of the elderly to familiarize with new technology. On the other hand, technological products and manuals are designed primarily for the younger age groups. Studies show that elderly persons fi nd it diffi cult to understand manuals. Whereas international research exists in the fi eld of manuals for the elderly, there is no corresponding research in Denmark. Also, there are only few Danish manuals specifically aimed at the elderly. The purpose of the present contribution is to discuss, on the basis of general recommendations in the literature on user manuals for the elderly, to what extent controlled language rules can improve such manuals. The general purpose of a controlled language is to make technical texts, including user manuals, easier to understand by reducing ambiguity and complexity through restrictions on lexicon, grammar and style. This investigation is part of a research project titled: Development of methods for the design of technical manuals for elderly people. In a later project phase, different versions of user manuals will be tested and evaluated by users within the target group.

A report on the mentioned usability tests is available here: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305876012\_Usability\_Testing\_of\_User\_Manuals](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305876012_Usability_Testing_of_User_Manuals)",1524700567.0

shadeobrady,"I think your lens you're speaking through may be a little skewed, or at least I don't understand the specifics of your question. I just listened to the podcast episode mentioned in this thread and have some thoughts assuming that is around where these questions are coming from:

Information that drives strategy, projects, and iteration come from a multitude of channels. These are from areas like marketing (trends, etc.), generative research (going out and shadowing your users, living in their shoes, etc.), customer service and sales (feature requests, issue reports, etc.), and product testing (which references the question above).

In an ideal situation, when someone says that ~5 to 10 user tests are typically helpful carries a number of assumptions. Direct prototype tests imply that other forms of research have been carried out and that the tests are informed through a number of facets. Most products will utilize this level of prototype tests when they're iterating which implies they have a foundation of feature understanding and are testing a number of people to make changes measured by the channels above as well as the risks involved in their changes.

Now, do people always do the above? No, most certainly not. But I think it's pretty alarmist to say that this form of testing is improper without understanding how product design works holistically (in reference to /u/The_Super_Carrot).",1525054286.0

I like that left\-clicking on posts now opens a modal window with the comment section, rather than re\-directing the user to the link/reddit permalink. This way we don't have to open multiple tabs to view individual posts or spend time figuring out our location on a previous page as often. ""Card"" mode makes it especially easy to consume content since you don't have to click as often to view ""expandable"" posts.
* I'm excited to see how people make use of the new subreddit layout design tool. I'm not sure if the update has taken away customization options for front\-end devs, but I'm hoping that more 'normal' mods/designers will take advantage of the tool and reduce the number of subreddits that are eyesores.
* Edit\- I also like that the default tool for adding comments has text formatting in it now. No more having to look up markdown formatting whenever I write long comments :\)

What I don't like:

* Seeing sponsored posts while I'm scrolling. Yes, they'd been there before infinite scrolling was implemented, but since they're no longer in places where I can expect them to be \(as the top or bottom post on a page\) they've become a tiny bit disruptive to the browsing experience.
* The search function on the header bar doesn't seem to return correct results when you search for usernames.",1524596176.0

godofsmiles1,"I think it's a bad move to have a default for images to be automatically ""expanded"". The thing I love about Reddit is the ability to view tons of information at the same time via thumbnails and text. I see that you can adjust to ""classic"" and ""compact"", but it's not immediately obvious. And now there's infinite scroll automatically enabled == But my RAMs!!??? All images open + infinite scroll = biggest memory hog & latency.

The modal window when you click a link appears nice at first, but try to scroll to the bottom of a link with lots of comments: The window appears to freeze and doesn't let you know that you've reached the bottom. Poor feedback for the user. Also the ""close"" button disappears as you scroll down the modal. How do I leave now? Yes, I can press the escape key or click outside the modal, but why not have a static-location button to make it obvious this is a pop-up modal?

Also, I can't seem to see any default subreddits when I'm not logged in. It appears I should be able to choose from a few in the left side nav, but it's blank. The side nav takes up so much space, and for what? Instantly sucks for lurkers, but maybe it's a push for signed in users? But limiting site functionality with a sign up function is bad user experience.

jsavalle,"Thanks for rising the question, I was actually thinking about that the other day... I'd say the answer depend which problems we are trying to solve. 

Channel owners want users to get every notification possible, because they want the engagement. 

But we know that users don't always engage with each and every notification and if they get too many notifications, they start to be desensitised, so to say, and then it is a problem for Youtube  (beside the fact that this feature would have anyway lost its purpose). 

So I'd say that from this perspective, youtube is wise to not overstimulated its users attention. Facebook does the same, btw...

The problem I see remains more in the face that youtube doesn't give the user that much control over its feed and how to consume the content. 

This is not about notifications, more about the feed but could also be applied to notifications. 

So for instance, if your interests are about unicorns, car, maths, and  I dunno let's say news... 

Whatever you watched recently is gonna define what sort of feed/notification you are likely to enjoy and/or react to. 

But if you have a math exams coming up, you are likely to get notifications about and content recommendation mostly about math. Yet, when you logging into youtube once the exam is over maybe the last thing you want to tune in is math, but maybe you just want to see unicorns and then tune in for the news.

Most content platforms have a way to categorize the content you consume. But youtube actually got rid of this, and took total control over it. Once you could organised your channel subscription into feeds and today that's not possible anymore. I gather they got rid of it because people didn't use it that much... But they could easily suggest self categorisation and they you could tune in to a specific ""world of content"" around a specific topic... like a ""super channel"" and when you tune in this super channel you get the live notification of what's going on in there - including from channels you haven't visited in a while, because you know, maybe you didn't tune in into this specific category for a while, but now that you are revisiting, you'd like to get all notifications from everybody in this topic/category....

summerinside,"Language and Point of View are important.  The interface communicates to the user, and in turn, the user communicates back to the interface.  Amazon has done a great job from a UX and language perspective in setting a consistent Point of View that your revamp misses.

For instance - if a user is logging in but is forgetting a password, the interface might say, ""Forgot *your* password?  Here the interface is asking a question and addressing the user in second person.  Now there's a rule, so let's follow it consistently.

For a second example let's look at Amazon Prime Video.  There are a couple brochure-ware pages that focus on *what Amazon wants to tell you* about Prime Video: what it is, what videos are available, why you should sign up, how much it will cost, etc.  There is also a transactional location where you would go as a dashboard of sorts to manage *your* Prime Video account: your billing and payment history, your video preferences, etc.  By maintaining Point of View, and making a second-person distinction, this menu dropdown signals to a user that this is *your stuff* - Lists *you've* made, *your* location to manage *your* Prime Video Account, etc.

Plyphon,"So the problem is, in UX design there is a whole lot of work that needs to be done in order for the deliverables to be worthwhile.

A technical test for a developer for example is nice and contained - he just has to solve that one problem.

But if you ask a designer to 'Design this new product for X' (I've received this exact challenge, with more words) that's literally a whole UX lifecycle you need to undertake and deliver, which could take months (or years!) to do properly.

So you've got two options as a UXer applying to these tests:

*Option 1:* Make up all the data and use a bunch of assumptions. Rush all the deliverables to the point of uselessness.

The problem with this is UX without data is *literally* pointless. It's just lines on paper (or screens). UX isn't lines on paper, UX is creating value for users by aligning user goals and needs with business vision and strategy. The boxes and lines you get on a website or phone are just manifestations of that value. The deliverables (wireframes, flows, etc) from a UXer are just manifestations representing that value that your business will build. 

So if you're not designing with data, it's pointless. You can provide this data (eg: business vision and goals, user personas and research insights) if you have them, but in my experience this is treated as confidential information not likely to be emailed out to prospective applicants. You could also provide dummy data, but dummy data produces dummy results, so again it's hard to judge any usefulness unless you build a really deep set of dummy data - but who has time for that?!

*Option 2:* Actually conduct a UX strategy from start to finish.

The problem with this is at this point you are doing incredibly valuable work that would costs thousands for a business to contract out. 

When do you stop? It might take you a few evenings to plan the approach. How do you get in touch with the stakeholders to conduct the strategic interviews that take place before kicking off the work? You need to understand everyones motivations in the business. These interviews themselves could take two weeks to get done around everyone elses schedule (and during work hours, of course)

Do you do 3 nights of user research after your main job? How much time do you spend drawing flows? Another 2 nights? 

Wireframing - if it's a complex product with deep flows this could take *weeks* of full time work. 

We've not even got to prototyping and testing yet!!

So the problem is, either you deliver useless work which is disheartening and is a complete waste of time, or you spend a hilarious amount of time to try and actually execute some work, all for a prospective job application.

In my experience, when I've received these kind of homework tasks they are far too broad (Design a new X for Y) for you to provide anything of use - in reality you can't really propose a proper UX strategy until you understand the vision and constraints from the business, so really anything you submit is just buzzwords on paper - anyone can Google for 'UX strategy' and write down some buzzwords, so really it gives you no insight into the applicants abilities.

Whiteboard tasks are better imho as you can get a look into their thinking process as they sketch out their strategy. The actual deliverables mean nothing, it's all about the thinking process.

So really it comes down to respecting everyones time and not getting applicants to do pointless tasks - it doesn't set a good first impression for your business and *you will* get worse applicants as a result. In my opinion, i'd preface the job spec saying you'll be expected to conduct a whiteboard task if you're invited to interview.

If you're up for it - submit some of the homework tasks here and we can try and make them more focused to deliver the insights you need to understand if applicants are right for you.


EDIT: My current employeer set me a homework task if I remember, but they said please not to conduct the deliverables, just talk about your thought process and strategy. This was a better balance as they were letting me know as an applicant that they were respecting my time and not expecting a bunch of useless flows and wireframes.

And then in the interview we discussed my proposal and I got to speak more about what I would do.

EDIT 2: The biggest secret in UX is that deliverables are bullshit. It's all about understanding what questions to ask and how to deliver value - if you can do that without a shit load of big deliverables (Lean UX) then you've delivered value with less cost. But this doesn't translate well to a interview/homework process where you are asking to see their ability in creating deliverables.",1524475632.0

ronin84,"1. As with anything, you need to be passionate about learning. If you're just getting your feet wet, gauge this by your interest in UX articles you read... books you read... and by actually ""doing things"". Participate in daily design challenges, for example. Or perform some competitive analysis. Or perform a UX Audit on a site you find particularly cumbersome to use. If you're passionate about doing these things, it's never too late. My GF got into UX at 29 with a totally different background. Within a year she was employable. It certainly helped that she has a great eye for design and is interested in data based solutions, rather than purely aesthetic.
2. Please browse around the sub, this can be answered by a million people in a million threads. Both of those books are great primers.
3. Bootcamps can get you in the door, certainly. General Assembly and Design Lab are good at teaching you bare bones basics. But you **must** strive to learn outside of bootcamps and uni to be successful.
4. It depends on what you want to do in the UX field. It's very broad. Some UX folks are purely researchers with no design chops, others are more visual, others focus on wireframes and user flows. Just depends on what you're good at and what the company is looking for. I would personally focus more on the design side. Learning how to code isn't necessary, but it **does** make you more hireable, especially in heavily engineering focused organizations, and a lot of orgs look for those unicorns that are essentially UX/UI people who code front end.

sampan121,"Get a library card. Then sign up for Lynda.com using your library's free resources.

They usually cost a subscription but they are much cheaper than a degree course. There are usually loopholes into accessing these contents for cheaper too (maybe a shared account although unethical). My advice is to get as much experience and practice as you can with the tools you have available. Even if all you have is pen and paper, sketch out a few websites, learn from resources, and then go back and analyze how your sketches can be better.

granolatron,"Here’s one way to think about it:

- Start with a set of *personas* that includes a description of their needs, behaviors, etc.
- For each persona, create a *journey* that shows they go through various *scenarios* along the way
- For each *scenario*, you can create a set of *storyboards* to show how the person actually interacts with the product or service at that point in time

In other words:
- A *journey* shows how a person (or a persona) moves through time
- A *scenario* zooms in on one point of time to describe the “problem” or need that prompts that moment
- A *storyboard* zooms in further and brings the scenario to life

Empathy maps can be a prelude to showing journeys, but the key themes from an empathy map should be apparent in the rest of the design process. A lot of bringing these seemingly disparate things together is a good narrative, and explaining the rationale for various decisions (e.g. the interaction in this storyboard is based on what we found in the empathy mapping exercise).

The other pieces you mentioned should also be in that narrative, either as a prelude — “these are the business goals and therefore we set out to see how to achieve them” — or at the end of the narrative — “we then mapped these user needs back to what our stakeholders said and here’s how they line-up” — or both!

Similarly, you can weave-in the brand analysis to set up how you tackle the user’s problem (why your brand taking the specific proposed approach for instance).

Here’s an example narrative for how you could weave this all together in a presentation or document:

- We started with a brand analysis to understand what people associate with our organization and what makes it unique [show brand analysis]
- Then we talked to stakeholders and learned that their primary goals are X, Y, and Z [show stakeholder maps, business goals, etc]
- We spoke with actual users/potential customers out in the world, and based on our research we found these four personas, of which we’ve chosen this one persona as our primary persona based on the goals of the business and where we can best serve this personas needs [show personas]
- We then illustrated the typical journey for our primary persona to highlight how they typically move through the world and the various scenarios they encounter [show journey]
- We broke down three of their key scenarios where we feel we can provide the most value [show scenarios]
- For each scenario we’ve sketched out a set of storyboards that shows how people will interact with our brand/product in that moment [show storyboards]
- In summary ... [show some sort of exec summary or recap]

* What's the user's current process for dealing with the problem? What's your plan for making the process better? Journey maps, storyboards, scenarios can help you with these questions.
* How does this affect our business or what stake does our business have in solving this problem? Stakeholder maps & brand analysis seem to fit here. Honestly, these two are the ones I'm least familiar with so others may have a different take on them.

You only hurt the company by not including the UX person. I've seen a lot of interfaces where it was obvious that role was not present. That's how I would have framed my response. It's bizarre--why did they hire a UX person in the first place with that line of thought? Clearly they must have felt a need for UX to find someone...

That statement rings some alarm bells with me. Like the boss has no idea why the UX person should be clued in.

I was actually in this same position not long ago. But it was different...in my situation they literally did not have enough developers to implement my UX suggestions, they had just enough to keep up with bug fixes and do one sprint at a time (usually backend stuff). So they eliminated my position, but I quickly found a different UX job and it's night and day. They value my opinion and can actually implement my suggestions.

My advice would be to pay attention to how you’re translating research findings into concepts, ideas, features, etc. and get really good at that. That’s one skill that, ironically, UX designers seem to lack. Fiercely advocate for good research, and be clear about which research elements influence your designs.

Also, there are lots of different techniques for prototyping and communicating interactions. Feel free to try out different methods. There’s never a one-size-fits-all solution for every project or every team, so don’t get too committed to doing things a certain way all the time (until you find something that works pretty consistently).

They look down on UX’rs who care about IA, structure, visual design, and the sort. There are many practices within the same disciple of UX, and at some point your just can’t be a jack of all trades.

My advice; get your feet wet. See what feels right for you. Get an understating of the entire practice, but there’s so much room to specialize. Take a look at Design Ops types of roles, you might find that interesting.

aruexperienced,"heh - they're kind of loose definitions to work to. ""why does this suck?"" is a loaded question. So is ""why doesn't this work?"".

Any tool will live on a spectrum of ""highly usable"" to ""highly unusable"" for ""all users"" to ""very few users"" and it's best to establish where on the spectrum they are. If you mapped findability, discoverability and usability based on user feedback and any metrics you have you'd have the start of some decent research.

For example features that are slightly unusable by very few users is common and forgivable. Something that's slightly unusable to all users can be disastrous and is not.

User types need to be defined based on the platform and intended audience.

The end of the first page of google provides the user with an evaluation point where they will decide if they will enter new search term (and view a new set of sponsored advertisements).

In an infinite scrolling scenario, the amount of ads google actually shows you would be extremely jarring - search for something like ""Web Design"" and count the amount of sponsored links, it's already 20-30% of the initial 100 results.

Another thing to consider is that users know how to ""read"" a google search page, we know where the sponsored links appear, where the suggested alternatives are at the bottom of the page, and most importantly we know that results on ""page 2"" are not as valuable as page 1 - again, those sponsored links on page 1 are sounding more juicy as an advertiser right?

I think there's two reasons why Google might not want to use infinite scroll, the first is because infinite scroll could create a paradox of choice, or in simpler terms choice paralysis. So this would cause people to spend more time on the search page and not necessarily find the results they are looking for. The second is, when you have click on a result, and then click back; it is difficult to go back to the previous position in the search. It is possible, but it would most likely not show the previous results, and this would severely limit the user.",1524032476.0

UXyes,"In usability studies (1,2), infinite scrolling has been shown to be specifically bad for interacting with ranked information or for users who are in task-accomplishment mode. Infinite scroll can induce choice paralysis, it encourages browsing (infinitely) and discourages making choices, it can break the scroll bar and/or back button. There's also an implication by the loading of more results that you should look at them–that they are important. Google search rankings are logarithmic. The next results aren't nearly as important as the ones you can already see. All-in-all it's a terrible design pattern for this use case.

Infinite scrolling shines on large collections of items of similar or unknown interest to users because it provides a seamless experience that encourages thoughtful browsing. It's straight up awful for well-sorted search result pages.

Another method is to copy the text, paste it into notepad, copy again and paste in the end application. This achieves the same result, but is a different way of doing the task that the designer hasn't designed for. It's not wrong its just different.

You are looking at an uphill battle trying to launch a legitimate UX career in Toronto tbh. The UX maturity level (in my opinion) in Toronto really isn't that great. 

You have some decent companies that get it (Shopify, WealthSimple, Akendi come to mind) and some places in the surrounding area that get it (IBM, Canadian Digital Service) but the overwhelming majority of companies still think UX = a visual designer who can hopefully do some coding and animation work. 

If you are expecting to work a legitimate role where design is earned through user research and there is actual evidence-based decision making and iteration stemming from user research...you're better off looking for roles in the states. 

There have been efforts made to educate the Toronto companies on the importance of UX and the interactions of the landscape as a whole, but it's moving too slow from what I've seen. Couple that with the fact there are TONS of bootcamps grads, visual design folks, fresh grads, and self-taught people all competing for limited positions... it is going to be a tough one.

My best advice is to go to an accredited program where you will get hands-on experience with real-world products and services with commercial companies. Use this experience to grow your portfolio and showcase your skills and methodologies. Credentials can be a good measuring stick for trustworthiness and competence, but in the end, having proof of work is usually what is going to open doors.

The interesting thing here is that this image still pigeon-holes UX as a function of UI whereas UX is a much broader field.

A lot of this stems from the fact that most stakeholders hear about UI and UX at the same time, during the same track at some conference. It's because from a business perspective, UX is almost always accompanying the function of UI.

Listen, it's not the world's job to understand your role, it's your job to explain it to them. If you feel misunderstood or under-appreciated, it's because you're failing to communicate or demonstrate your discipline.

thatgibbyguy,"Agile is a software development methodology that is based on *sprints*, *features* and *iteration.*

A real world example that might contrast to what you might have experienced in a design agency, for example would be this:

A client has approached you for work designing the UI of an app they are beginning to build. They have given you a week to present three layouts of the landing view and one will be chosen. In total, they have given you a quarter to solve all of the views and UX issues. This is waterfall - it has a set timeline, does not value iterative work and isn't focused on feature release - it is focused on the entire end product.

Agile is in direct contrast of this. You have been approached by a client that has $X budget and Y idea. You will begin to isolate features, which are known as ""stories"" in agile, and you will begin to prioritize those features. Each feature is assigned a point value which describes both the *effort* to produce this feature as well as the *value* of the feature (this is a weird concept to get at first). 

Typically the features are gathered together in a way that once they are all complete, you will have a releasable product with the first release being the Minimum Viable Product (mvp). As a UXer, you will lead this as in you will need to have UI for those features designed in advance of the developers (duh, they need something to build). Once you get enough views designed, the developers can start building while you continue to design. 

The features are also split into *sprints* and *backlog*. A sprint is typically two weeks and has a maximum bandwidth which refers to the maximum amount of *points* (from above) that the team can produce in the sprint. Only a combo of features whose points add up to the teams available bandwidth can be pulled into a sprint. 

This allows priorities to shift through the course of building the product. For example, in testing you may find out that one of your user flow decisions isn't working out so well, you can re prioritize that in order to fix it.

This is in direct contrast to a waterfall approach where you might only get to revise after the entire thing has been done.

There's a lot of talk about how UX fits into agile and I think I've given you nuggets about how that works, but in general you want to be developing UI/X concepts to your client or product owner before developers can work on them and you want to be out in front of the developers at all times so that in the case where you have to revise you will at least have a backlog of UX work the developers can then implement.

I could write on and on about this, but there are several resources online that cover this really well.",1523552136.0

about me profile that lists contact info, a large photo of yourself, and some quick bio info like your interests. 

case study projects that don't tell me everything, but tell me how you approached a problem, solved it (or didn't solve it), and what you learned. present with deliverables.

have a mobile + web project, or some other variation. diversify your knowledge. ux can be applicable beyond web or mobile. for example, you cleaned up a restaraunt menu and made it more readable/changed the visual design? that counts as a project, so long as you tell me why you made the changes you did and how you talked with stakeholders.

As a counterpoint, I'm working on an enterprise application with specific legal requirements about data retention and discoverability.

When I hire someone, education doesn't count for experience, but  if I ask questions about what you studied, I'm looking for passion and someone who was pursuing their interests because that probably means that's what you're doing now (ie. applying for a job at my company).

SchoolboyBlue,"I've heard of anthropology / ethnographer and other related studies being able to move into the user research aspect of UX - totally on the other spectrum of UX from wireframing and such but equally important.

Keep in mind only huge companies like Facebook and Google can afford to hire these people - and from what I remember they tended to have M.S. (definitely check for yourself though.)

You could try transferring colleges - I know my alum UC San Diego has a fantastic UX / HCI major which feeds into a lot of the bay area tech scene. You'd be a great asset in the UX world if you already know how to create prototypes / MVPs given knowledge of any front end (React, iOS, etc.) and any middleware / backend / hosting. 

My own story - I studied EE and hated it, barely graduated. Found an embedded sw engineering job (yuck) and in the past two years I decided fk it and started my own company, then became a product manager at a more established startup that was doing something similar.

Product management is a great fit because it still leverages my years of engineering experience (I understand what engineers need to go through to build whatever feature, product, modification) but I get to think creatively by working with UX / UI and even the sales teams to do need finding and manage a product roadmap.

Be happy to answer any questions about Product Management, but that seems like it could be a good compromise. (In which case you can finish your CS degree since it's a great asset, but you should gun for Product Management internships at larger companies.)

Don't underestimate the value of a technical degree. It provides a lot of credibility - especially since you'll be working with engineers in the future and you have to understand what is feasible / what isn't feasible (more of a product thing than a UX/UI thing). At the same time if it kills your soul by all means focus on UX / HCI and build a portfolio around it if you can't find a good major.",1523248550.0

I'm sure that they'll have some good plans of actin, especially considering that a lot of them definitely didn't get their degrees in HCI.

My take on it is that IOE-Human Factors track might be an awesome idea. I think having that background and then applying to the HCI Master's degree would be a really really solid plan. Also, have you considered minoring in Art & Design? Yes, that means doing extra art stuff but it's a great way to get some solid design skills.

senakin,"So I discovered something similar. I was a marketing major and wanted to move into UX but my school didn’t have a major for that so I used my electives to take a few CS classes to learn basic front end coding and also took a few graphic design and visual communication courses. You can also take free online courses to learn the same skills. Didn’t get any experience though, before graduating, so I took a job doing customer support at a tech company and slowly I’m making my way up to customer experience to move into a more UX role. 

My roommate realized the same but she was a CS major so she just took design classes and applied to do a fifth year at our university for UX since we have a graduate program for it. She is about to graduate and is in the process of finding a job. She also had internships in the software engineering field at a very well known company all throughout college. So far, she isn’t worried about finding a job in the UX field but also still hasn’t landed anything just yet and has gone on a number of interviews. 

I highly recommend reading the book: The Design of Everyday Things. It is all about the thought process that goes behind UX. Both of us did this when we weren’t sure of what we wanted and it just helped us figure out what we liked and didn’t like. If you identify with what the writer is saying I’d look into taking a few CS classes and learning Adobe Creative Suite. If not then you can continue along knowing the path you’re on is a better one for your interests. Regardless I wouldn’t change your major, engineering is useful no matter what.

&nbsp;


(1) As stated a few places before, focus on grades because I also do recruiting and frankly it's just an easy way to filter out candidates when looking for jobs through traditional channels.  

&nbsp;

(2) Start to understand as much as you can about the field. READ. A lot. Start with the Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman. There's UX Research, Visual Design, UI Design, Interaction Design. Lots of different things that get lumped under UX with different levels of maturity and understand of what User Experience is really about. A lot of this depends on what market you'll be in after school. E.g. West Coast vs. East Coast vs. Metro-Detroit area. Each market has different levels of maturity in the job market. Pair your academics with projects where you can demonstrate your experience. Within the field of UX demonstrated work is key. 

&nbsp;

(3) Attend talks at the School of Information and around the University. Be on the lookout for groups like MISC or talks at the Stamps School of Design. They just had David Kelly in town from IDEO. These will give you perspective on the field. 

&nbsp;

(4) Look for clubs where you can get hands on experience. I know there are a lot of multidisciplinary student groups throughout the university that would give you an opportunity to practice but you'll need to bring some knowledge to the table through classes, projects, or your own teaching. 

&nbsp;

(5) Network. Network. Network. Networking will help you learn about the field, people can recommend books, you might even be able to join a project.

While you are wrapping your studies I'd recommend networking at tech/UX events, reaching out to companies, and put some form of visible portfolio website together that would give employers a snapshot your background, skillset, and research projects you've worked on.

For CMU, do you mean the Human-Computer Interaction program or the Bachelor of Design program? I'm not familiar with the faculty at either of those programs, but from what I've heard it tilts slightly more to the academic than SVA. Probably a slightly different cohort of people given the price tag to get in. 

They are both very good schools, so I would say figure out what your career path is. If you want to go the traditional HCI / design-school route, that tends to be agnostic of current tech / practices, CMU might be your best option. If you want a grounding in design that also comes with industry experience, SVA would be great.

* Remove the starred tab and perhaps even remove the starring functionality completely, I never used it myself and none of my friends did either
* Remove the notifications tab and put it in an icon that opens a pop\-up
* I'm trying to remember right now what the contact book button does, which is probably a sign that it's not important enough to have such a prominent position
* Move less important top bar items \(contact book thing, help button, etc.\) into a secondary dropdown menu or similar
* Remove the device indicators for listeners, I don't care if they listen on their desktop or phone. Possibly also remove the activity status indicators \(yellow and green dots\), i haven't found them useful either
* Possibly make the vote meter smaller by turning it into a horizontal bar graph. There's no need for it to be so large
* There are multiple buttons with the same icons/labels all over the UI, such as playlist sync/audio sync, and playlist export and whatever the export button at the top does \(another one where I can't remember what it does\) \- either label them more clearly or find a way to make some of them redundant. For example, it would be cool if it would sync the playlist automatically, without having to click the button
* Rearrange the tabs to form a song selection window \(only visible to DJs\), a social window \(messages and roomies\) and a currently playing \+ history window \(including notifications if you decide against making it a popup\)

Edit: another idea would be to reduce it to a two\-column layout, with the social window being always present and the other side having the now playing section at the top, and switching between history \(for listeners\) and song selector \(for DJs\).

1\) For single sign\-on, where you enter an email and the service goes off and talks to a system connected to the email address to authenticate you \- so you don't have to enter a password \- this is commonly used by corporates. So you enter the email, it goes 'oh yes I need to go talk to ABC corp', and then redirects you.

2\) Detection of registration vs sign in. Where you enter in a username/email and it checks if that exists \- if it doesn't then the form changes to a registration form.

Plyphon,"You can do a 'Expert review' yourself following NN's usability heuristics:

https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/

The 'skill' comes in spotting your errors which a UX professional will be better at doing due to experience, and also having an outsider come in can be beneficial as they won't be ""attached"" to the project emotionally and can act impartially.  

Effectively, all a Expert review does is make sure there are no glaring usability/accessibility errors with the interface design.

You can read more here:

https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-expert-reviews/

Another great usability checklist is here:

http://ixdchecklist.com/

FWIW - Expert reviews are a perfectly valid deliverable when coming in to triage a new project - you can catch a lot of 'low hanging usability fruit' that can have a huge impact in your product when fixed.

HOWEVER - they should come as part of a bigger UX strategy that involves user testing, contextual studies etc etc etc as an expert review will only answer so much.

TL;DR - Perfectly valid thing to undertake, would be wary paying for one as standalone. If you're not already conducting a UX strategy then I would think about the bigger picture and how a expert review fits into it.",1523004167.0
Smashoody,"Be careful. If a “UX” person is cold calling you... saying they want money to “review” your site... that sounds an awful lot like a graphic or web designer who can’t get legit clients, and is trying to use the buzz word of “UX” to get your attention. 

The brutal truth is that any UX “review” is in theory good info. However, paying money for UX as a role or job - is less about having an opinion about a product/service and more about knowing all the productive ways to conduct, study and document results from user testing. 

So again, a real UX person would want to do research and/or talk to users, and not just “review” your site. Anyone who’s trying to review, judge, critique, or assess your site as is... is just a graphic or web designer trying to pretend they are a UX Designer.

Ps - a proper UX review takes from several days to a week of research - plus the time it takes to put all of the data/findings into a presentation, so things are understandable for the client. It’s NOT a trivial or inexpensive task whatsoever. Just FYI :)

As far as new features, competitive analysis, client interviews and ethnographic studies, journey maps, and task analysis can all be good methods to discover opportunities for enhancements to a feature set.

gmdavis62,"Off the top of my head from my experience:

- Lots of features come from a sales conversation with a single customer or potential customer. The customer might say ""I don't like your product because it doesn't... but if it did, we would buy thousands of them!"" This information gets communicated via telephone-game to the product team. By the time we hear it, it may no longer fill the need the customer wants. 

True story: I was designing a touch-screen UI for a copier with a new scan-to-email feature (long time ago). I was TOLD a large customer said our touch keyboard was not good because ALL their employee's emails contain a number which required them to go back and forth between letters and numbers kb layout. After spending lots of time trying to cram both letters and numbers on this too-small screen, I ran across an email from this customer. They didn't have ANY numbers but a never before mentioned dash ""-"". I did some digging and verified this so that a very simple, quick change was all that was necessary. 

- Some features come from competitive analysis. If a competitor, especially a major competitor has a feature, regardless of how useless it may be, we are always afraid to NOT have it. 

- Similarly, some features come from LEGACY. We have always done it that way. If we take it away, we DON'T KNOW what customers will complain. 

While this can be true, Jared Spool just tweeted this today regarding that attitude:
-----
  Users don't hate change.

  * Users hate when you take control from them.
  * Users hate when your change shows no value for them.
  * Users hate when they’ve invested in learning your design, only for you to disregard that investment.

  Users don’t hate change.

  It’s you, not them.
-----
https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/981508690594418688

- Some features come out of someone's ""genius"" brain. They might be good or bad but you can't tell without research (relatively cheap) or to build the feature and see what happens (expensive). That genius can be anyone, from UX to CEO. 

- Lastly, and this is less common than it should be, some features come from research into how customers really work and how that can be improved.

plasma_dan,"My team doesn't really have a 'product manager' per se, so our new features usually come straight from the most pressing needs of our most important clients, or potential customers. Essentially, a company gets our MVP, writes back about the things they wish it could do better, and we negotiate the best path toward accommodating as many of those requirements as possible. It's messy to say the least.

Once a feature is prioritized, I get started on my UX work. I'm working in Fintech for a B2B company, which means that I don't have direct access to end users. I need to work off of a more 'lean' approach to research, whereby I make lots of assumptions about who my users are, and try to get interviews with people who could be deemed as 'representative' of a potential end user. I balance that against lots of competitor software research, searching for best practices and determining what could be done differently to solve a particular problem.

After research I start iterating on lots of ideas either on paper or in Sketch, writing down questions along the way. I flesh out the concepts that I feel the most strongly about, and spiff them up for presentation to my boss (who has zero design expertise). From there I iterate based on his feedback, peppering in a feedback from a couple other company stakeholders. Sadly, usertesting my mockups or prototypes is often a luxury due to time constraints.

Obviously it makes sense to gather ideas for features based on user research, getting feedback on prototypes, and just spending a lot of time thinking about how to improve the experience you're aiming for. 

Different people think differently, but I can quite easily come up with 100 features for a project, so the challenge then is figuring out what the right criteria is for judging an idea.

I personally don't find the whole 'UX developer/ front-end UX' thing that uncanny, it's a by-product of the same specialist consolidation we see in development (full-stack), operations (devOps) and now in UX/UI.  Being a UX designer is definitely enough for a full-time job at almost any size company, but that doesn't stop many companies from trying to squeeze 'extra' value in what they ask from their employees responsibilities.

The pressures of modern front-end development are frankly very daunting right now.  Babel.js, ES6, TypeScript, Reactive programming, and progressive web apps have rapidly transformed modern front-end development into increasingly more elaborate and abstract tools from humble HTML/CSS/JS.  You may find yourself very unprepared for what this role's implementation aspect means if you have been out of the loop in regard to the last 2-3 years of modern JavaScript.

I think you should see the interview through and be honest about your UX experience and what value it has.

sometimesifeellikean,"I work in a Canadian location for a US company.  I'm pretty much 100% remote considering that all my clients are in the US.  I sometimes have worked with the Canadian folk, but I'm the only XA here and as far as I'm concerned, as long as I have a good phone, and good internet, it doesn't matter where I am.  I do work with some of the Canadian dev and design team, but again, we rarely discuss anything face to face.

Edit:  what I can say does suffer is presentations.  When I'm presenting something new to a large group, and they're all in a room, but I'm the only one on the phone, it's tough.  I never really know what's going on in that room, and for a new group, with new designs or strategies, there have been some instances where I really wish I was in that room to read the group.  There was one instance for sure where I'm sure their phone was on mute as they discussed my designs in private.  It's hard to get a room back on your side when there's been a side conversation that you weren't privy to.",1522853533.0

The-Respawner,"I am having trouble deciding between what visual style and grid/layout to use for my frontpage/work section. I will link a few examples here, in order of which one I like the most, top to bottom.

**1:** https://www.filipgran.no/ (More varied and ""fun"" than layout ""2"", but people may be unsure where to focus their attention and where to click. This is a tie in with number 2 for me)

**2:** https://www.filipgran.no/work-grid-portfolio-duplicate-3?preview_id=166&preview=true (I like this one aswell, and I feel that it will help people scroll down and be more interested in each project, since they all take up the same amount of space. I am worried it might be too static and ""boring"" though. I will however use the same Driftwood animation as in ""1"" here, and not just the menu picture)

**3:** https://www.filipgran.no/work-grid-portfolio-duplicate-2?preview_id=139&preview=true (I think this one is pretty cool aswell, with a pure black and white theme. It might be a bit ""dark"" or un-fun, if that makes sense. It also requires more of visitors to click each project to see colors and what they are about.

**4:** https://www.filipgran.no/work-grid-portfolio-duplicate?preview_id=132&preview=true (Probably my least favorite of the bunch, but worth including)

**TLDR: I would love to hear your thoughts on what layout/design you prefer, and why. I would also love to hear your thoughts on the overall layout and design of the website! I will be using it for free-lancing, but mainly to look like a good candidate when trying to land a job at an agency.**

Would really appreciate some constructive criticism about some website wireframes I recently submitted for a potential job with a web/app design agency.

After submitting these to the reviewer he called these ""disappointing and poorly done"" without any real feedback or explanation as to why and what could be improved. I've reached out to the company multiple times requesting feedback so I could learn from this experience but they've pretty much ghosted me at this point.

As someone who has struggled with mental health in the past, while I find the prestige and technical bent of CMU to be compelling, I couldn't help but feel like none of the current students seemed like they were doing too well. The students and faculty at UW meanwhile seemed much kinder, more humanist, and all around more supportive.

,"Hey everyone. I've always been a 50/50 split between front-end dev. and UI design. This was mainly because I consider myself both creative and analytical and I thought that the only way to use my analytical skills in the tech industry is by coding. It never occurred to me that UX design is what I've been needing all along, as it utilizes the left-right brain skills and is both creative and cognitive. So just yesterday I decided to go ahead and pursue UX design.

The ""problem"" is that all this time I've been learning code and UI design, and it's apparent on my portfolio that I'm good at both, although I've developed some UX skills as well (think microcopy/writing, user flows, hifi prototyping, etc). Now, I have a part time job and started to dive more deeply into UX in my free time. However, prior to making my decision to stick to UX, I applied to a bunch of front end jobs.

I just got a call back to an application, and this position is a front end dev with a possibility of expanding into a back end dev as well, and I'm not so much feeling it (I get restless if I'm *only* coding and I don't like the back end) but it may be a good opportunity to gain some experience seeing I have none besides some freelancing and contracting. Not sure, I want to hear other people's opinions here. The company doesn't have any in house designers. **Is this a bad idea?**",1524583914.0

My background:

1. I am from India. Studied and working in India.
2. Have done my MBA in Human Resources in 2013 and previously did undergrad in Commerce.
3. Started a tech/digital startup in hiring space in 2013. closed it for various reasons in 2015. Thats when I first understood the very basics of UX and how digital products are made.
4. Since 2015 I have been part of a funded tech startup in the hiring space \(as an employee\) and this is where I have got deep knowledge of how actually tech products work. Over the years I have fallen in love with User Experience domain and I feel it is one of the prime factors that can make or break an organization. Although I have not directly worked as a UX'er here at my present firm but I have good understanding of the space and the sort of work a typical UX'er would do.
5. My current role is into key account management, sales and operations in the startup but obviously I am not happy in it.

I want to full time now transition into UX field and build my career here. I have enough understanding of the field to be convinced about my transition. I would prefer getting into the Research side of things rather than the design side of it.

Would now request your guidance on following:

1. Since I have no formal education or haven't completed any courses about UX can you suggest a few that will teach me more about the field at a deeper level?
2. What are the most important tools I must pick up to ensure that I can start applying for a job?
3. Where can I get some understanding on creating my portfolio?
4. What sort of initial job can i expect keeping in mind my background?
5. Any other suggestions you might want to give me keeping in mind my current work ex?

mrosasco_,"Hi guys,
I've just finished up my first year as an Associate UX Architect at an advertising agency. I'm considering going back to get my Masters in User Experience Design at Kent State. This would be online and part-time. I'm currently at a company that allows me to explore my UX passion but don't have structure mentorship so I've had to rely on my own research to back my learnings. I'm really drawn to the idea of getting formal education about UX.  My undergrad was in Strategic Communication (PR/Marketing type stuff) and I had no exposure to UX in college. I've also tossed around the idea of an MBA instead of Masters in UX Design but am leaning towards the Masters in UX as it is my passion and I can always get the MBA later.

I feel like there are a lot of mixed feelings about the usefulness of a Masters in UX Design and would like to hear your thoughts on it. 
In addition, what have you heard of the Kent State Masters in UX Design program? What part-time + online programs have you heard about having a good reputation? Do you have any opinion on a Masters in UX Design and an MBA?

Any direction or perspective would be hugely appreciated!",1528304715.0

Would like to get a pure User Research / UX role, have a few questions for current pros.


I’m currently working as a senior marketer at a marketing agency with a focus on user experience and conversion rate optimization. The parts of my job that absolutely love the most are user research (interviews, running workshops, questionnaires), data analysis, pulling out insights from research, UX wire framing, etc. 


I’d love to make the jump to a pure user research role, but I wonder if I can ask a few questions about what it’s like?


What are they main things you do?


What is your past experience? How did you get in to user research


Are there any resources you use a lot in your role? (Books, software, frameworks, analysis tools, etc.)


What are the most challenging /stressful parts of your job?


Would you recommend working in user research? Why or why not?


If you were looking to hire a user researcher, what types of info would you look for on their CV?

mike543256,"Hello. I am a 25 year old architectural designer (of buildings, not software) living in Chicago, one year shy of a masters degree in the same. I also have a bachelors in architecture and about three years professional experience in my field. I have been both dissatisfied with architecture and really interested in UX for a couple of years, but last year I started my masters in architecture anyway under a the guise that a masters degree of any kind of design would help in my pursuit of a career in UX. I have knowledge of the UX design process, as it is nearly identical to that which is used in architecture. I also have strong graphic skills and am proficient in the Adobe Creative Suite. 

Anyway, at this point, I am 100% sure I want to leave architecture and pursue UX. Would there be any benefits to finishing my degree at all? Maybe a higher starting salary or more credibility as a designer? I don’t particularly want to get another degree, and programs like General Assembly are incredibly expensive (and I have heard mixed reviews.) Is a portfolio demonstrating my design skills and knowledge of the process enough on its own to apply for a job? I can put together a portfolio of UX work, as I frequently work on UX projects for fun with friends who are UX designers (who have degrees in their fields.)

Is it good etiquette to tell a company you're applying to that the UI (that they've done for their clients) isn't great and could be improved? I'm applying to a company that has worked with great high-level clients, but it seems like whoever is on their UI team has a questionable sense of colour theory and visual taste.

I understand that UX is more than just the UI, but there are some serious flaws that I think a company of their caliber have missed. I personally believe I could make a huge difference to the visual direction in the design and ideation phase... but is it bad practice to point this out in a cover letter or interview?

I'm fairly new to ux, and I was currently hired for the position of Ux Designer internship at a fairly large company, considering where I live.

vtmn_D,"A good product manager (to me) gets the right people in the room, removes blockers, scopes projects appropriately, responds and adjusts as needed. He/she has many ""customers"" and many experts they need to manage. One I respect is one who is organized, stays on top of things, and asks for or accepts the input of other experts. 

A UX designer is one such expert. They should have the most insight on the user, the likely patterns to test and iterate on, and a good idea of the direction the product is heading. A designer often runs out ahead of the rest of the team so that there are fewer chances to spend a lot of time and inertia building the wrong thing. They also test and learn about the existing product so that it can adapt more appropriately.

RiotMontag,"This is something game designers think about a lot: a good *play* experience (or social experience) may not always equal the most convenient experience.

A designer at my job did a great talk about social design in games, and he noted how certain games like Golf have a ton of downtime built into the game, so they provide lots of opportunities to shoot the shit and enjoy your company as well as the game. He contrasted this with modern online games that often try to get you into a game and into the next game with the least possible clicks, and he posited that the strategy of squeezing out all the downtime between games may be detrimental to the social experiences of these games.

As another example, early on in Minecraft's history, there weren't a lot of online materials to understand the crafting system. It needed to be discovered and passed along from person to person. It made the initial experiences of the game highly social, because you needed to connect with others to understand the game systems.

Some modern games have this built into the gameplay. *Sea of Thieves*, which just came out, requires you to man a pirate ship with 2-4 friends. The systems are designed such that you *can* do it all yourself, but the activities benefit greatly from having others help. For example: when your ship gets hit by a cannon ball, it leaves a hole and the hold starts filling with water. You need to scoop up the water in buckets and bail it out, but you also need to patch up the hole. The efficiency of these activities scales with the number of people and improves with coordination, so it makes coordinating a lot of fun.",1522164029.0

I also realized I wasn’t spending my time the way I wanted to spend it. So a friend of mine suggested to take more control over my own calendar. I wanted to at least be designing, researching or prototyping half the time. I blocked my agenda every day from 12:00 to 17:00. If someone wanted a meeting, or if I wanted to have a meeting, it had to fit in the morning. It was cumbersome in the beginning, but eventually I had way more time to design. To my surprise, the meetings also felt way more productive. I had way more arguments to back up my design decisions. I believe my stakeholders felt the same way about having less meetings. 

Right now I rarely have meetings. I’ve changed my workspace to be able to hold meetings on the floor. I print out the flows and designs and hang them.

For anything that's more complex than basic ""screen A > screen B"" flows a prototype can be really useful to make sure you're on the same page. Not only for you, but also your (and their) stakeholders.

If you're interested, ask to stay in the loop about any research that they're doing. The better you understand the reasons for their design decisions the better you'll be able to implement that, or fill in gaps they left on your own. That's a nice to have, but developers that lack all context can sometimes be frustrating to work with.

Most importantly, try and establish direct communications between you and the UI designer that's preparing their final output.

If they use Sketch, I would ask for the Sketch file.  This is really important. You can upload to inVision (base tier is free) and get redlines, you'll have access to assets, etc. You'll find working with a consulting company that there'll be lots of back and forth on missed cases or misinterpretation. Sometimes it's just faster to do it yourself than wait until the next business day. It will also become invaluable for when you decide to bring all the UI/UX design in-house. 

Finally, break down the states your app will get into: empty states, error states and data flow. If it's not a security risk to share, the latter can be a flow chart of where all the points of failure can happen on the user's end and what they can do. For example, user saves - > sync fails - > user can manually retries OR app retries at next available time. Use your discretion and limit it to only how data flows in and out, otherwise you're just defining the UX flow instead of deferring to your hired consultants.

Other than generating assets in your requested filetype, ask for the SVG, too. It shouldn't come to it, as they should come to define padding and margins for those pixel perfect screens, but you'll want those assets on hand instead of having to find it.

In my opinion, it's more geared towards research then design. If you are on campus, you can work in the research center where you will do lots of usability studies and get practical expierence.

That said, since it's in the business school, you take two business electives (most people take negotiation) and some other design strategy classes.

If you need to, you can do the whole program remote or in campus. I actually started remote andpved to Boston but that was in the life plan already.

irafcummings,"It can be tough starting out freelancing without a network. I freelanced for a while, but had working for about 10 years beforehand and had a network built up from previous jobs. As a freelancer, you need a strong network, but how you get that really depends. Try to get to meetups and events in the industry that you'd like to work in, rather than UX meetups. Industry being the only or one of the few designers in the room really helps. It might also help to find someone \(or multiple people\) who are where you'd like to be in 3\-5 years. Buy them coffee, ask them how they got where they are, and see if they'd be OK with staying in touch. Learn from those people. Agencies can be a good source of freelance work as well, since their work cycles vary so dramatically.

Pricing is really difficult. I strongly suggest pricing by the project or using value pricing. You need a network of people to bounce rough pricing off of, but always understand that it's a negotiation. Don't low\-ball as your first estimate, but have an idea of, ""I wouldn't do this project for less than X."" Propose higher than this, but think about what you could cut from the list of deliverables to bring the price down to something that the client can work with. If the client approves your first estimate without negotiating, your proposal was way too low. If you work hourly, you end up having clients see you as a service provider and won't get bigger, more interesting work.

Same goes for tabs - I simulate interaction for first couple and simply showcase rest of the screens with minimum interaction.
And we're actually testing users on these prototypes. And it works well.

The idea here is to move on with your work with as little permutations as possible - or as I like to call it - sandbox modes.

ikinone,"I've been playing around with various models to equip my startup with.

I'd recommend getting the new 13"" model. I'd get the entry level version without touchbar (really not needed). Only things I would upgrade are potentially RAM (8/16gig, latter if you do video editing etc), and SSD (the solid state drive). Default SSD is 128 GB, but maybe worth forking out extra cash for 256 or 512 size if you need loads of storage.

Entry level specs in USD you can get for <$1300, which is well worth it for this spec computer/build quality. If you up the RAM and SSD, it'll easily hit $2k. You *really* don't need to burn $2500! $1300 will get you a very capable machine.

Bear in mind you can't upgrade them later (without stupid amounts of effort), so choose wisely.

People are suggesting to buy second hand, I recommend you buy new and treat it well, sell after a year or two for a decent return. The newer models really are a lot nicer, and it will last you longer, be more future proof, portable, etc.

Buying straight from Apple store online is easy, but you might find a better deal at BestBuy or something. Just be careful of exact specs and version. I was lucky to find one for $1099 at BestBuy with 128/8 specs.

As for peripherals, I recommend picking up a decent USB-c adapter.  Saitechi is a decent brand. I like the hdmi/usb3/usb3/USB-c version. Costs about $60. Ignore people crying about dongles. It's really not a big deal. USB-c charging is awesome.

Brucecris,"Goddamn this is long. However, it addresses not just you, OP, but all of us who have gone through dry spells. Here is a story about my experience and things I learned along the way. 

————

OP, this is my biggest fear and it keeps me on my toes (I’m 20+ years). I had a long dry spell when the recession hit years ago. I was consulting to everyone and making tons of money in NYC by delivering quality results some huge brands... total resume builder. Then all of a sudden the budgets changed, contracts ended, renewals dried up and boom! I’m in the middle of a project and they literally tell me “We wont need you tomorrow.” Fuck me. 

It took me forever to find something again — everything in my life suffered during that time period. And when I landed somewhere I hated it for a long time. Corporate UX/design teams absolutely sucked at that time (and still do IMO, no offense). Eventually, I reconnected with friends I used to network with (network!) and ended up with an amazing agency as a FTE. I was in heaven and haven’t looked back since. Now, the agency was eventually gobbled up by a large digital player and now we’re one of the biggest in the world. Great place. Looking back, I don’t think I got lucky though. I purposely networked way back then, at first to try and get leads but eventually my contacts came through with a gig for me when I least expected it.And instead of hustling for work I chose to settle down because, now, I am cognizant of the market trends. I now pay attention to trends in ways I never used to. I don’t ever want to have another dry spell but that dry spell taught me a lot when I look back. 

What I learned was that, other than my knowledge, the following things were critical for me finding employment after a long time off: 

- Your wisdom & experience. It will always be the door opener. Leverage the hell out of it. 
- Network with everyone. Don’t you dare burn bridges. Smooth over professional differences.
- Have a positive, grounded attitude. Be magnetic but not creepy.
- Be confident but not cocky because people don’t give a shit about you, they only care about themselves and their careers and livelihood. 
- Participate and become perceived as a thought leader. So many of us are afraid to get up and talk about a topic (me included) but when you finally do it you will feel so much more confident and people will treat you differently. OP you said you do this so good for you.

Now at one point in time I was jumping from place to place, hustling for gigs and making cash and spending cash but now it’s hard to do as a senior level pro like yourself. Experienced practitioners are not in demand like they used to be - the industry has evolved so this doesn’t actually surprise me. Many senior designers (10+ years) have taken up residencies at agencies and organizations and have shifted to management, strategy roles where they serve by leading, managing, and cultivating young (less expensive) practitioners or third party talent coming in from staffing companies. it’s hard to be solely a practitioner these days. Senior UXers need to lead, manage, consult, and cultivate. I’m not saying that’s everywhere since I can only speak for my experience, of course. However, I’m confident in my thinking since I’ve spoke to many others. 

I’ve said way too much. Time for me to get off the toilet, puns n needles in my legs. 

This is a good topic and we should open up more about this. Lots of trends happening. OP, I’d love to learn more about you and see if I can get you hooked up. Pls DM me at your leisure. Good luck.

gmdavis62,"I am in the same boat. Except I have about 20 years experience and this is not the first time I’ve been looking. I’m almost getting desperate but I know what I need to do. So, this is advice to me as much as it is to you. 

Applying to jobs online and emailing people will only get you so far. You need to get out there and network. I used to think this was going to professional events and clubs. But that’s not helpful really. Most jobs are never posted online or anywhere. 

What I learned to do (but avoided doing until now) works MUCH better. I learned this from a placement agency paid for by a layoff severance deal. 

Create a document with your marketing plan. Yes, you are the product. What’s your focus? What are your competencies? What kind of companies do you want to work for? What cities? Put this all down on a nicely formatted page or two. This is NOT a resume. It’s a for leading discussions with friends and associates and really generating leads. 

Here’s a decent article on how to create one. (Being a designer, I assume you can make it look nicer!)
http://careersherpa.net/creating-your-personal-marketing-plan/

Next, call or email friends, family, former colleagues etc. and ask if you can take 20-30 minutes of their time for an informational interview. Bring a copy of your marketing plan and a personal business card (with your contact info). Don’t bring your resume. Explain what you do. (Probably doesn’t surprise you that most people have in idea what we UX people do.) Ask them if they have people at their company that do something similar. If so, what are their job titles? (Add these to your preferred titles if necessary Important: Get their business card. Show them the list of companies you already know you want to work. Ask If they happen to know anyone at any of these companies. Ask if they have other suggestions. Leave the marketing plan with them and ask if they think of anything to let you know. 

That same site has a follow up with more detail than I gave:
http://careersherpa.net/your-marketing-plan/

This should result in an increasing number of contacts at various companies and you can set up informational interviews with each until you have scores of people thinking about how they can help you. (Just tell them who referred you and they will usually say yes.) I’ve read very recently that the most helpful leads come from loose connections, not close friends. 

I’ve done this on past job searches and it has worked. I am like many artistic types introverted so I procrastinate and do this after exhausting other methods. I always conclude that I should have done this first.

hologramcrackerz,"Yeah that's me. ""Innovation"" is in the name of my department and I work at a fortune 100 (not a 100% tech focused company). My dept also has more standard software responsibilities (staff aug) in addition to the innovations work so I see both sides of the coin. Similar to what the other guy said a lot of stuff doesn't see the light of day but there are instances where small POCs will be incorporated into larger projects or sort of take off on their own. I've personally worked on a VR app that took off in a couple cool ways (mostly in marketing/sales capacities). We also did an application for internal company use that became an officially supported product and now will be offered to a lot of other companies/users. 

As far as how the work differs, for a lot of the time the goal in the POC phase is to make something look really cool/flashy to get people excited about the idea. Usability rightly takes a back seat since the only ""users"" you have at that point are internal stakeholders. I think having a mix of both types of work is ideal. You get to stretch creatively, get some broader design experience in other form factors (AR, voice, mobile, web, ect) but still have a chance to do real stuff. If I had to pick only one type of work though there is nothing better than shipping real software to people when you work on a highly performing and collaborative product team (hard to find). The flip side is that larger more 'waterfall' projects with less capable teams can be extremely painful. Innovations work definitely beats that.",1521754589.0

ronin84,"I've hired a a few designers over the years. I don't think I can remember a single portfolio landing page. What I can remember is how someone presents their work. So despite you saying don't look the projects, I did.

On your existing portfolio:

* Consider including a logo or a screenshot on your lander for each project. It would add a lot of visual appeal to your page and give me something to reference back and get excited about seeing. Your lander is also really dark. A lot of us dual screen - Mac laptops with external monitors to test typical viewing environments for users... I could barely see your website on my external monitor.
* Look around for more interesting ways to present your work - right now some of your screenshots don't have containers, or are poor quality, or your explanations are difficult to read as you resize your browser. It's always better to place your explanations in HTML text, rather than within the JPG.

You get the drift. Focus on your work. Landing page visual design is obviously very subjective. I prefer seeing beautiful typography and white space on a bright page when I look at UX portfolios. But if someone has a sloppy case study - I notice.

A great resource for portfolio inspiration is Twitter. Find a prominent UX/product designer, check out their follows/followers, and look at their portfolios linked in bios.

Resources on Windows UI/UX are few and far between, if they exist at all. And there's no real official direction, let alone support from Microsoft.

I've been working on a few Windows apps for some years now and while I'm mostly just an external observer (UX guy, not a dev) I can tell you it's a mess. Basically, what we do is all mostly WPF with some parts stuck on GDI. UWP is a scare word for most of our devs and I feel like nobody really knows what to expect from the platform. You can however build UWP stuff in .NET (VS 2015+).

WPF has been chugging steadily for a long time and as far as I can tell, it's still great for all sorts of visual stuff. But it's completely barebones, you start from scratch with most UI-related stuff.

Maybe someone else will chime in and show me how outmoded the team I'm working on have become, and I'd gladly learn some new hot trends in this respect. But I'm afraid it's pretty stale and kinda DIY, since very few companies actually do fat clients for Windows any more.",1521652011.0

https://www.infoq.com/news/2014/04/WPF-QA

WPF, Silverlight (now defunct), Xamarin.Forms and UWP are all based on the XAML stack.

Many like to treat them as they were completely unrelated stacks, but that is quite far from how it actually works like.

Yes, it is true that they don't expose the same set of APIs and feature space.

However all share the same concepts of XML based layout engine (XAML) even if with small variations, how resources are handled, creation of custom controls, styling, MVVM patterns, data binding concepts.

Telerik has lots of controls for WPF and UWP. Also as a means to try to make up for lack of components on UWP, Microsoft has made a deal with Telerik, so that their controls are free for UWP developers.

Regarding XAML standard, and possible native GUIs for .NET Core, Scott Hunter mentioned on his interview at .NET Rocks, [The .NET Core 2 Road Map](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1527) that they will be announcing some UI goodies at BUILD 2018.",1521661518.0

* **Page Speed**: This is a no brainer. There aren't really any silver bullets in UX... except for speed. Even bad interfaces can be learned/explored without frustration if they are very very responsive. For example: go watch the cashier at your local auto parts store fly through his green screen POS system while ringing you up. Its UI is garbage, but it responds instantly.

* **Time on Task**: How long dies it take to complete a critical task in your system? Set this up like a conversion funnel. Start the funnel/clock when the users begin the first step in the task and time how long until they complete it. You can also see possible frustration points where users abandon the funnel/task.

* **NPS or Net Promoter Score**: 1-10 scale reporting on the answer to a single question survey of your users, ""How likely is it that you would recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague?"" More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter

* **Error Tracking**: How often are users hitting validation errors on your forms? Error pages in your app? Timeouts? Are things easily broken? Do your forms suck to fill out/are they hard to understand?

Those are some good ones off the top of my head that likely apply to whatever it is you're doing without knowing too much about the market/business.

Regarding your comment about wanting to research, but having too much to do. This is a coming feeling and if you think it's going to go away, you're kidding yourself. Do the research. Getting something right the first time by adding a little thoughtful consideration into your process is a much faster way to work than building shit that doesn't really work over and over. Learn from other's mistakes, the benefits to this will be exponential throughout your career.

beasy4sheezy,"I feel like there is lots of larger improvements to be made, and also some refinement.

Larger things, I feel like you should add a user story where the app helps the user set up their preferences. Perhaps it will check out their history and help them set a budget based on previous months. This would be a huge help to the user because the configuration settings seem like a total after thought. Clicking the cog for the charts denotes that I will be adjusting settings for charting, maybe what charts to see and what labels to use. What it does in your app is open the budget, which I didn't find anywhere else, even though it's ultra critical.

Also, I think there should be more interplay between the screens. What's the difference between the ""inbox"" screen and the history of transactions in a category? Just the filter on category? So maybe those screens can be consolidated. There's also a lot more potential for scrolling instead of putting everything on different pages. People are used to scrolling through feeds.
Another thing, what is a balance? Is that remaining budget? Or is that remaining credit, or money in a checking account?
And I didn't see the bank interplay from the story boards about fraud. I guess I missed it in the inbox sections, which really should be named something else I'd think.

With small things, there are some mistakes, like having forgot password on the new account screen, and putting a cog icon next to the user name. And at least one typo I found.

Overall, I think it could be executed better with more refinement. How much user testing did you actually do, and did people understand how to use the app, because I'm pretty tech savvy, and have used Mint, which basically does this exact thing, and I couldn't really get it quickly.

RedditBlow5,"Its a good start for a first project, you should feel proud.

That said there are some mistakes or gaps in your research when looking at your medium article.

You didn't mention any competitive research. The problem you identified ""I realized that it was extremely hard to control and keep track of my balances, especially for several cards from different banks"" made me think of several apps that solve this issue. There are already several budget apps the bring in data from your banks like You Need A Budget. There are several financial apps that do this as well, Mint being the best example. You don't always have to reinvent the wheel – sometimes you can't – but you should talk about ways in which your solution improves upon products that already exist. Otherwise, your solution will just look redundant. 

The biggest red flag I have is that you talk about how you had an idea that came from a personal frustration and then set out to validate your idea. This is a red flag because you are essentially looking for answers to a problem when really a UX designer should be looking for problems and using the UX process to create a solution. I get that you went out to validate your theory with users which is great but it seems like there wasn't any user research that lead you to that problem beyond your personal experiences.Maybe that was the way coursera structured the project but it isn't a great way to go about UX.

UX designers don't build solutions for themselves, they build solutions for users - other people that are going to use your product.

Again, I think you did a great job considering this was from an MOOC and on top of it you paid for user testing out of your own pocket, created an article and a youtube video about your project.

This is not comparable with Hawaii where better design could have prevented this.

These are either business decisions or a blind eye from management. Same for the Volkswagen Diesel scandal - I don't think any UX guy there is to be blamed for the cheating software that was used.

But I agree generally that in a more complex world in which the use of software can save lives (in the medical field) or ruin lives (forget to set a party to private and end up with thousands of people destroying your house), UX and design do have a responsibility for the outcome of interaction with their designs.

Silhouette,"Try to be objective. I agree with other commenters here: where you can let the participants ""do the talking"", literally or figuratively, rather than reporting the same information indirectly with your own voice, that might seem less aggressive in a potentially awkward situation.

Also, try to present your research and findings as a constructive exercise. You're not supposed to be there to make anyone feel bad or assign blame. You're supposed to be there to help them improve the product. It seems like you really are approaching this with a good attitude and you really are trying to be helpful, so make sure the design team understand that too.

Of course some people might be defensive anyway, or might resort to shooting the messenger. If that does still happen even though you've given a fair, constructive presentation of the facts, it might be unpleasant but remember it's in no way your fault. It is up to the other team's management to make it clear to them that they need to do better or, if they really are producing bad work and unwilling to change, to deal with that appropriately.

On the other hand, you might be pleasantly surprised. Maybe the people who wrote that copy weren't sure about it themselves, and now you've given them an objective reason to fix some writing they never really liked. Maybe the design team had a lot of internal debate about these issues and some of them already suggested doing this kind of research to resolve the matter but they didn't have the resources. Stranger things have happened.

need_moar_puppies,"You will want to explain why 5 participants is enough.  Sometimes when people hear something they don’t like, they will try to dismiss the sample.

Definitely let the participants speak for themselves.  Show them video clips, have them see EXACTLY what they’re struggling with, and categorize it.  Does it all come down to IA issues?  Is it discoverability?  If you can say it’s just one problem with multiple examples, it may be an easier pill to swallow.

As much as I hate doing it, it’s easier to eat a shit sandwich than a mouthful of shit.  Say something positive, highlight the issue, then either say something positive again OR suggest a fix.  For example “Users depend on this product and use it a great deal because it’s easier than not using it.  (Positive) However, they had low success rates in this kind of task whatever. (Negative aka shit).  This is something that can be resolved with a card sorting exercise/rearranging the workflow/fixing the labeling to reflect the users’ own language/whatever. (Positive or solution) “

Make sure that it doesn’t feel like a criticism of their work, but a way to empower them to fix the flaws that didn’t get addressed the first time around.  You can highlight the issues, but unless you have a solution or a big “so what?” addressed, it may put them on the offensive.

In the future, having the designers involved in the planning and beginning, as well as watching some of the sessions remotely may mitigate the issue of having to drop a surprise bad news bomb on them.  They will be eased into the idea that it’s not doing as well as they thought.

Good luck!",1521563132.0
milkeymikey,"Your mgr is right to suggest including video highlights. A nothing thing you can do is to preface the findings with exactly what the stakeholders were hoping the product to do. Don't use jargon like ""the first hypothesis we evaluated was blah!"" but more ""we asked you what was important for this product, and we found out how well we did from people who represent your customers!""

A lot of it has to do with affect: get them to excited about the fact that the team didn't waste precious capital building a solution that would have failed to meet their expectations.

At the conclusion, invite them to a second round of testing if there's budget for that. Especially if they question whether you truly know what they are think is important.

However it's possible you may not be able to put a positive turn on negative feedback. Next time I'd suggest you invite as many stakeholders to observe the sessions live even if they can only pop in and out a session or two; send short executive summary/bullet points as soon as thematic feedback pops up. Stakeholders can react and see for themselves, instead of putting their trust in a process they are not familiar with. ",1521565355.0
audrikr,"Oof, that's a rough situation. The best advice I have is that poor usability results are only bad if the you plan to do nothing with them. It's a *huge* opportunity for improvement to make a stellar product, and should be treated as such. My worst fear tends to be usability results that are just.... mediocre. No follow-ups, no specifics on where you can take action. Those are the most difficult to work with. Mostly negative results tend to have more directly actionable steps. 

As for a plan for your presentation, make sure every piece of feedback you show is actionable. Nobody likes seeing that their hard work sucked, but if there's an 'easy' way to mitigate some of the most pressing problems, it helps a lot. Include suggestions for fixes or improvement opportunities.

Every issue is an opportunity to improve the product. In fact, if you ran a study and nothing ever came back wrong, you should seriously question whether your study design and moderation were done right.

While it's true that bootcamps tend to flood the market with under prepared fresh grads, I think your credentials going in, what you did during it, and what you do after matters a lot more than what the statistics are.

If you want to be a UI/UX designer and not one over the other, then you would be a great hire in an early-stage startup. These companies tend to not focus on your education but more on your portfolio and personality. 


If you want to apply for jobs at more established businesses, then I would argue that you should get a Masters. The reason is that a Masters will validate your commitment and it makes your application go automatically further in the beginning.

My story is a bit different but more or less same situation. I chose to get my Masters, but I extended it from 2 to 3 years because I had a great UI/UX job at a startup (20hours/week). My experience was that the Masters helped med a lot after I graduated because I wanted to focus on UX design and strategy. The thing about UI/UX work is that the process is filled with people; as a designer you cannot just sit in a corner by yourself, you have to learn about programming to talk to developers, you have to learn about bussiness because you are working with the ceo, you have to learn project management because you are juggling a lot of tasks and they need prioritization.

planktron,"If you are trying to find these roles in one person then you might be chasing an unicorn. People who do all of those things might not be competent in all of the fields you have mentioned. There are very fiew people who can do all of this professionally and they usually ask a lot of money to wear all the hats in the project. 

Just to be clear what to expect from these roles. UX designer is basically a researcher and analyst who will help you understand your users better, define the structure of the app and validate if the concepts work. UI designer is competent in graphic design, animation, illustration etc who will help you make your app look appealing to the target group(s). Front-end developer does html/css + JS etc. If you are developing a native app then this is a totally different beast to develope for. 

It would be more realistic to find 2-3 people to do the project professionally.

How to estimate rates? Ask around to get an overview what the rates are for designers and devs in your region. You will see some patterns probably. How much freelancers and different companies ask. When asking for estimations for projects discard the cheapest and most expensive offers.

What tools to use for mockuping? Are you an UX designer? If not then leave it to the UX designer. For the introduction of the first ideas sketching something on the paper is enough to get the idea across. I've seen it many times when clients fall in love in their own designs and make the designers's work very hard because of that. First ideas are not usually the best ideas. Be prepeared to see different ideas and concepts.

How to introduce the project to UX designer? Talk about who is it for. What kind of problem you are trying to solve with the app and how. What are the key concepts and functionalities. In what situations is the app going to be used.

If you’re looking for prototyping there are so many online tools to choose from and you’ll find loyal users everywhere waving the flag of their chosen one and defending it with all their energy so I’d recommend trying some out.

Recently I’ve found Figma (www.figma.com) pretty good. It’s received solid funding and is very similar to Sketch (same shortcuts etc) but works in the browser. It has basic prototyping and libraries for building reusable assets and is capable of hi-fidelity design too.

InVision also has Studio out on public release soon so that will be interesting.

Others include Proto.io, UXPin, JustInMind, the list goes on.

As much as Axure is fairly powerful, for me, if I need more logic in a prototype, it’s easier to code.

ed_menac,"Axure is your best bet. Reading through the comments here, it seems that what you need is a flexible prototyping tool with a lot of out-the-box functionality. Axure can do all of that, so your instincts aren't wrong.

I started out using Axure, so I took all its prototyping functionality for granted. When I moved on to more visual design tools (Sketch, Figma, XD), I found it much easier to create beautiful statics... but struggled with the loss of prototype features.

I think people unfairly overlook Axure because they're used to having the pared down functionality of other tools.

However for building complicated prototypes without coding, Axure is the king. You have to really go deep to find functionality which Axure doesn't support - and even then, you can use custom JS to circumvent the missing features.

Also, Axure is very easy to iterate in, and so long as you have Axshare, you can even iterate during a user session and push the updates in real time.",1521187959.0

It's often important to be and to capture the user having to type or being able to create error states, inline validations, or set dynamic variables. It's a totally valid ask, as the closer the prototype is the real, the more real your results.

I've worked with plenty of huge company's research teams and we always prefer to stray away from tools like InVision as that's simply a glorified PowerPoint. Plus, when you get good with a tool, it's not only faster than coding, but it let's you build the prototype exactly as you want without having all the back and forth with a developer.

nchlswu,"I highly doubt you'll be able to meet all that criteria in one tool, and I'm not sure it will be worth it to create a workflow

Right now Axure looks best if you insist on using a tool, but I honestly imagine you'll hit a wall where working primarily in code makes a lot more sense. 

My initial thoughts are

* logic: Axure would be great for logic 
* sharable: practically everyone does that and if not you can throw it on a webhost
* pivoting: this all depends on your tool proficiency and how you implement the data. Axure would be okay, depending on how much you iterate on a design and if you implement data separately. I've never implemented additional programming on top of the Axure output, so I have no clue what that entails
* sketch files: I'd honestly dread a Sketch-Axure workflow, but Axure did release a sketch plugin for easier outputs I haven't tried. so that would still leave Axure as a strong candidate. 
* Desktop and mobile: I honestly haven't seen any prototyping software create fully responsive outputs. Does anyone? 

I'd really look into figma, but you're essentially coding... though atomic.io looks super cool.

pietro93,"First of all congratulations for getting noticed by Google!
UX/UI is a bit of a mix of disciplines, people from all types of backgrounds usually have some skills that they can apply but need to make up for others. What UX/UI has that architecture doesn't (I assume) is the interactive part. When you design a user interface it's not enough that you make it pretty, it also has to be usable. Design requirements change significantly based both on the type of medium you are designing (website, mobile app, game, digital service) and the users you are designing it for.

I personally like to learn about UX by reading random articles on medium:

Are you providing them with any compensation for their time? You could withhold it if they don't complete the test to the standard you agree. 

Or you can run moderated user tests with them and get better quality information. 

Or you can just continue asking and encouraging them to do so.

HawkeyeHero,"Solid list. I see lot of complaints over in r/webdesign about sites that all look the same, but if it works why change it? I'm not saying to not be creative, but logo and nav in the header are pretty dang standard -- not too much you can do with that without sacrificing usability.

I'm kinda iffy on the social media. For huge brands it's a must these days, but Tim's Plumbing doesn't really need to have an instagram feed. However, I think this is just a byproduct of our own environments -- my usual work doensn't need that, but someone who works for bigger firms certainly may.

Personally I see the next wave of web design to connect very intimately with a very small set of user tasks. Currently lots of sites have way too many pages, and while a responsive site allows you to get to them on tablet or moblie, there's still way too many choices and it becomes a chore. I think 5 or less pages moving forward will become the norm, with an option to dig into a deeper site for those who want to read for an hour.",1520958162.0

Know that it's also ok to make a decision now and change it later if you feel your priorities and interests have changed. Most college students change their major at least once. 

If you're passionate about UX, and it sounds like you are! I'd say the latter option of the IS degree with the CS minor sounds like it would be great. You'll get a fair amount of useful dev skills from a minor, and it will certainly set you up with the framework to easily learn more in that area should you choose to. ",1520889283.0
DeadDisciplinary,"I'm not sure that I can speak for being competitive at Graduate School, since I haven't started looking at grad, but in my experience, being competitive for UX positions at large companies requires more experience rather than a degree. I'll be candid, I spent alot of money, and I got an Information Science degree with an HCI concentration and a CS minor at one of the top private schools in the world with an amazing UX program, and I kept getting rejection letter after rejection letter for without even getting an interview with HR for UX positions.

&nbsp;

My assumption is that this was largely due to me not having any experience (no internships), so I had to take up some freelance jobs for the last semester of my senior year, and only then did I start getting offers. When I applied to Software Developer positions, it was a lot easier to get interviews and offers even though I have only a CS minor (and programming related internship). That being said, I took a bunch of software development classes, and did pretty well on many of the programming challenges.

&nbsp;

TLDR; in my experience: UX positions look for experience (internships and freelance) and Software engineers look for your success in interviews, and its easier to land a job with less experience. In my opinion, a CS major with an IS/HCI minor and a bunch of freelance/smaller UX projects would put you in a good position for both UX and Software Engineering.",1520948908.0

Second: Is it colleagues who have knowledge about the problem and the research, is it stakeholders who are impressed by shiny things, is it customers that have no idea what they will be testing and who will try/click things you didn't anticipate at all?

Third: Are you able to ""set a stage"", leverage frustration and steer testees back on track if they go off course during the test? Also, how hard is it to get new testees if a user tests fails?

pietro93,"1. Please do not have developers perform user tests, especially on the product they have been working on! Chances are they will have a biased opinion on the platform and how it 'should' work. You ideally need someone with an academic background in human-computer interaction, psychology, or anthropology to get the most out of user research. We have experience designing user studies and experiments that yield results which are measurable and relevant.

2. I would suggest hiring a part-time freelancer or full-time intern if you can afford it - if your target demographics is that of millennial gamers, you could get some valuable insights from a student or recent graduate. There is also some specific knowledge related to evaluating gameful systems and games which you may be looking for (since these types of systems need to be designed for ""playability"" in addition to usability).

3. That could work as long as you prepare your interview carefully - write down a script and practice with a couple of friends so that you can improve it and yourself. A good interviewer asks very general, open-ended questions, then moves to more specific topics without ever interruptuing or expressing their own opinion, otherwise you will end up ""spoonfeeding"" answers to the interviewee. 

I would also like to add that if since you only have a MVP at present, I would suggest thinking of this more as a service design problem than a UX problem.

Plyphon,"I'd like to point out that demoing a product is different to UX research. 

One capacity is sales, one is research.

Unless I've misunderstood your OP, if you go into a 'research session' in sales/demo mode you will not get back good data about your experience, and possible damage your UX process and product from the results.

But, in short - you need to understand what your value proposition is, your service design to deliver that value, and then what your biggest assumptions within those bodies of work are and what your businesses leading KPIs are (Google: Innovation Accounting) - you then test for those assumptions and refine/iterate your value prop/service design based on those outcomes. In a lean startup, you should be testing/researching everything you build to understand if you've built value for your business (and customers!) by increasing your leading KPIs. 

Regarding your point 1: there is a great story from Google Ventures' Savioke about how they built, prototyped and tested their product in 5 days. It's an absolutely fantastic example of lean product design/development and well worth everyone in your team reading:

-dillydallydolly-,"Some great points made in the comments here already. Some other practical tips:

1: Video record your sessions. This way you don't have to have all of your development resources in the tests, but you can review and show everybody in the company first hand these ""aha"" moments you speak about.

2. There are companies out there that will help you round up participants. If you need a lot of participants in short time, this could be a good way to go. You can give them all sorts of criteria for the participants, which will be based on what you are trying to test. Coming up with the criteria will be the job of the person designing the test. Another way is to create a survey to filter out for appropriate participants. As mentioned, this should be handled by someone with UX research experience.

For your question #3 specifically, I would advise against a push notification. It's low context, and you'll get people clicking on it just because they want a free gift card.

barryandlevon,"I've used many tools, and it comes down to cost, how it fits in my overall work flow, and ease of use.

Userzoom (such a dumb name) is the Swiss army knife of user testing. It's for teams who are serious about investing in user experience - - like tracking the impact of design changes on usage, engagement, unmet user needs and satisfaction. But it costs a small fortune and the learning curve is very steep for most designers-cum-researchers.

Lookback is a glorified webex/zoom. Too much setup for not enough value as opposed to the alternatives, IMHO. Must set up observers, guests, have the right browsers, all so you can have in *yet another location* to host documentation that no one has time to read.

Usertesting.com is great because of its integrations into many tools. I've only used it maybe twice, but I'd try it again.

Optimal Workshop is the best for tree, click, and cart sort testing. Haven't found something out there that comes close in terms of pricing and ease of use.

Webex/Zoom is the easiest/quickest way to do testing outside of a lab. Requires you to know to make some adjustments (like muting participants, setting up recording access ahead of time m, etc.), but has the lowest barrier of entry for participants and most natural ""feel"", both for remote and in-person testing. You can automatically save the recordings in the cloud, and it integrates with other tools like outlook and slack.


None of the tools above do a really good job with the real tough part of user research: finding participants that truly represent your users. That's why I tend to like UserZoom ability to intercept real users on your site and ask them if they want to participate in a study. Really powerful, but oh so pricy. ",1520529055.0
ed_menac,"Hotjar - which is less 'testing' and more 'anonymous spying' but also with the ability to add surveys and polls to your site. It's lovely though! Best tool I've used.

Optimal workshop - love it, but it's not your average vanilla user testing. It does card sorting better than anything else I've seen, plus treejacking, and some neat tools for organising and collating findings.

Validately - which we've literally never used because getting users to install the Chrome addon is a barrier (often due to firewalls)

Userzoom - not any more, since it is far too expensive. Basically not been updated meaningfully for about 10 years, clunky as hell, and users drop out due to frustration.

Decibel - basically a worse, more expensive version of Hotjar which repackages google analytics with fancy heat maps which have no meaning other than to impress stakeholders who like pretty pictures. It had session replay, but it never worked and was unusably slow.

Join.me - this is screensharing, but great for phone/skype conversations where you want to watch them use a tool, or walk someone through a prototype. It's free and super simple to set up.

mongtariza,"Finish the program. I was in the same situation as you 2-3 years ago. I took a UX course during my gap year before college, and after starting school (majoring in communication design), I felt like I was wasting time because I was taking traditional graphic design classes just like you and wasn't learning anything related to what UI/UX. So I seriously considered dropping out of school and start full-time, but my mentor at my internship encouraged me not to. When I asked other designers about dropping out, they all say that school is a place to get exposed to new things. You can easily learn technical things like using Adobe programs online with your own time. You don't have to pay school tuition to learn that nowadays. So knowing that I'm going to be doing UI/UX for the rest of my career, I try to take classes that are outside of UX like generative art, motion design, theory classes, etc., and build my UX portfolio and UX skills at internships, working on real problems with real users.

Lord_Cronos,"Love the enthusiasm! It's a cool idea that you're clearly passionate about. I want to make sure you realize though that getting people to adopt your idea and change their behaviors in the process is an incredibly difficult part of design.

You can make the most beautiful, delightful app ever, and it's not necessarily going to be picked up and used. User Experience design is a vastly larger field than the aspects of it that you're asking about. I'd urge you to learn about user research, or even better hire a user researcher, to help you in making sure you're solving problems that your prospective user base actually cares about, and doing so in ways that they'll want to use. Asking stuff like ""Would you use this app?"" or ""Do you like this idea"" isn't going to be enough. The problem space of almost everything is vastly more complex than that. 

Your questions are centered around UI design, not UX. That being said, I'll weigh in a bit. 

1. Layers are a means to staying organized and able to easily iterate on design. If you have no layers you're basically painting and it will be difficult to make changes or refinements. Layers keep separate elements separate and easy to edit alone. Keeping your layers organized helps aid in this workflow.

2. PNG supports transparency, other than that there's not much difference. There are services that allow you to turn over mockups to developers that will give them some code suggestions and dimensions, but what your devs will find most useful should be a conversation you have with them, not us. 

3. UI Kits, symbols, and the like are all helpful for designing hi-fi mockups faster. There's nothing inherently wrong with any of it, it's all about how you use them to help yourself and that they're helping you in designing what will work for *your* users. 

4. I don't believe PSD import is currently supported in XD. 

5. Delivery to development can take all kinds of forms. Again, you need to talk to your devs and find out what they need from you to deliver on the design you want. Open a dialog. Collaborate. Take suggestions. Figure out what you need to produce to convey what you want to be developed adequately. 

And once again. Engage early and often in user research and user testing, or hire somebody who will. You may find you need to change and iterate on your vision if you want to build something that will actually be adopted and used. Designing and developing something in a vacuum is a recipe for building the wrong thing. ",1520526273.0
JustHere4C0mments,"1) Layers are important for so many reasons, can be hard to explain but for me it makes small changes incredibly simple. If you decide you dont like the look of a small piece of your design you can change it or make incremental changes without having to potentially start over.

2)Your dev team is right...PNG is higher quality and preserves transparency. JPG can be really useful for web/app graphics with no transparency because of their small file size so they can keep your load times down.

3) If you are designing this yourself with no real past experience, there is nothing wrong with using a template to get you started. At least I dont think so.

4)Not sure what the interoperability is on this one, so couldnt say if you could import a PSD or not

5) Try not to bloat your screens, especially on a mobile platform because you are just going to run into load and speed problems. It may look awesome as far as your design goes but you also have to consider the resource toll for loading all those profiles/images. If you are married to the idea I would suggest start with a light version of what you described (ie. dont enlarge photos, reduce information on the profile, maybe kill the animation of the challenge button) stuff like that. After you have something working perhaps start looking at those incremental changes to the experience and see how/if they affect your performance. Your app could be shiny and beautiful but nobody will use it if it takes too long to do anything.",1520526196.0

lloyddobbler,"Overflow looks interesting, particularly vbecause of the Sketch integration.

TBH, up until recently I've still been using OmniGraffle, with a healthy dose of stencils/templates to support the workflows I'm used to.

I specifically work with [Jesse James Garrett's Visual Vocabulary](http://www.jjg.net/ia/visvocab/), which I think is still the best way to demonstrate user interactions. In his book [The Elements of User Experience](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-User-Experience-User-Centered-Design/dp/0321683684/) he makes the point that the visual/""surface"" layer should be separated out in planning from the structural layer. I agree wholeheartedly with this directive. For that reason, a tool like Overflow or Invision comes in handy at the very end of the design process - but in the midst of planning user flows, one should be working firmly in the world of ""boxes and arrows.""

That's why right now, my current go-to choice is [Whimsical](https://whimsical.co). While I can ultimately paste imagery in as-desired, from the beginning, it lets me be better able to work in boxes-and-arrows until I develop the full scale of the user flow.

I've tried to pass the artboards through Acrobat, which makes printing an artboard as a poster easy, but it's not as easy as Keynote.

I'm not sure if this is your passing through Acrobat flow, and I only watched part of the Interaction Flow Kit video but it looked like the plugin wasn't dependent on artboard size (they made it smaller after porting the screens in). In that case, why don't you just make the artboard size A3 in sketch, then export? I use the plugin 'PDF export' for this and it works great.",1522591660.0

wintergreenbliss,"That's an example of creating a new product category. There were rudimentary smart phones before the iPhone, but the iPhone was the first to create an intuitive, easy to use smartphone that allowed users to much more than make phone calls, and to do it easily. I'm not sure if Apple did any formal surveying before creating the iPhone, but they went through common UX processes to identify user pain points from similar pocket tech devices available at the time, and probably hypothesized that users would want a convenient all-in-one device that they have a habit of carrying around all the time (aka, their cell phones).

If you ask your users to define your features you're missing out on the right discussion, which is WHY they want those features. They have limited scope on what you can do, what is possible, and they're boxed into thinking about what they know. As an outsider your job is to work with their problems.

No one would have said ""oh yeah, build me a phone with a touchscreen"", but the iPhone was the 10x better solution to a lot of consumer problems with a product category that at the time was dominated by blackberry with little spin wheels and track balls, bad UX, and a smaller screen.

thrillandcreate,"Do I agree with your boss?  Yes and no.

When your users are SMEs, you can in some cases just ask them what they want, design it, and have it built.  But sometimes these SMEs are not in agreement with each other.  I find mapping them onto personas and deciding based on the primary is one way to reach a solution.  

But it isn’t always foolproof, and sometimes a stakeholder with more domain expertise will need to look at your findings with you and make the call.  In the example I’m thinking of, I was working with a large global client on card sorting.  The users, all SMEs in their own right, had very different understandings of the problem, and the IA that the card sorting study produced was not going to make sense.  The stakeholders and I worked through the findings after the fact and came up with a different IA.

Another case is when there’s just a lot of market demand.  For example, a tour bus operator I was working with had countless reviews saying, “You need an app to track where the buses are.”  The solution in that case is pretty clear.  And it’s a good solution because their passengers would have access to their phones (and an app) while on tour, but they wouldn’t have access to their laptops.

arnthorsnaer,">This has gotten me thinking about whether I’m a traitor to my craft for being more about getting a functional product out to meet business needs... so much that I’m wondering if I’m no longer suited for this field.

It feels like this is a over dramatisation. However I am unclear about the role you are playing here. It sounds like you think that the social media buttons in the footer should be there and that questioning that decision is ""agonizing"". My POV is usually to start with less. 

You have an aggressive deadline of getting the functional web application to the market .. to see if it has legs to stand on. The question on social media buttons in my mind then boils down to: does including the social media button, help or hinder the web application finding it's legs... or do nothing? 

This is the question I would to balance every decision at this point. ""Will this help the web app to find it's legs?"" 

Of course this does not prevent people having different opinions about decisions, to resolve that the team needs to agree on how it resolves these kinds of issues. Many companies just allow the corporate hierarchy to resolve these kinds of issues. I however prefer team discussion and the team figuring out how we can discover what the underlying differences in opinion is about and find a easy way to test and resolve this. It's easy to say something like this so here is an actual example: 

This one time there was a difference in opinion in what the default view for the application should be. Some team member felt it should be X because ""of course it should be""...  while other team members felt that it should be Y because ""that's how the customers and users felt"". So we had a preference question....  the side for X thought that most people would want that and the side for Y thought that most people within the demographic would want that. Everybody agreed that it would be damaging if we shipped the application with the default that did not work for customers... and team members also agreed that leaving this as a ""option"" for users to set would be a cop out because both sides felt they were obviously right. 

This was resolved by sending out a survey internally where people were shown both options and simply asked which one they felt more comfortable with. The results were very clear in favor of one side. Other side had to face the fact that they were highly specialized and therefore their intuition here was wrong.

This sounds like a lot of work, but it was not. The team had experience with resolving conflicts and not getting sidetracked by bullshit. They agreed that finding a solution was important. And the survey took 1-2 hours to prep, send out and get feedback on. Don't misunderstand though, this is not about passing the problem of deciding to someone else, this is about finding what your theory (opinion) predicts and see if it holds. For the social media button question, the way to tease this out is for the team to agree that if the social media buttons are a great idea we should be able to name 10 comparable websites... and of course the majority of them would be using it (no peaking). Anyways, I don't really know anything about your situation. However your ability to help the team resolve these kinds of issues is a UX skill in my view... asking the question ""how can we validate this"".",1520365028.0
lilmalchek,"For me, being a UX/Product Designer means taking  the user’s needs and objectives, standards and design patterns, research and testing, and everything else in the “UX toolbox” and weighing them within the given constraints (timeline, scope, developer resources, etc). Sometimes you just have to take your gut (and sometimes personal opinion) into account.

In an ideal world, we would have plenty of time and money to do thorough research and interviews, multiple iterations of design and testing, and all stakeholders involved in the process. But honestly it could go on forever.

I’ve found the most important and nuanced skill as a product designer is balancing that “ideal” process that will lead to the “ideal” design with real world constraints.  For me, an example is a typical project that does like this: “You need me to add some new settings to this area of the app? Sure, but to do that we need to also fix these other issues that will arise with those settings. Oh and the way they are organized now doesn’t really make any sense and we’ve been meaning to make these UX improvements anyway so we can redesign this part so we can be more clear about what the settings do... Oh we need to start development in 2 weeks and it needs to be released by the end of the quarter?”

That means doing your best to make trade offs, and knowing when to push back about the need for research or testing. Sometimes I can’t test but I can find at least anecdotal evidence or research online to support a decision one way or another. Or I can whiteboard with the team to weight the pros and cons of an approach. Or do guerilla testing in the office.  Or choose one option over another because it will take a week less to develop and test.  Or “settling” for a design that isn’t perfect because of constraints. It can feel bad, but that’s just the real world. But we can acknowledge this and learn how to make those trade offs and adjustments while still achieving a good experience for the user (because, let’s be honest, it can ALWAYS be better).

This is where your skills can shine- knowing how to adjust your workflow and what tools you’ll need for a given project. You’re obviously passionate and reflective about all of this, so I would argue that you’re not betraying your craft, but actually doing exactly the right thing and thoughtfully questioning with intention. And that’s what makes a GREAT designer IMO. 

Sorry for rambling but I wanted to tackle this from a few possible angles and make sure you feel supported. Honestly feel free to PM me if you’d like to chat about this any further.

Given you are working on a new product (or so it seems), and on a tight timeline, keep it as light as you can. Get something working to market, with a reasonable level of user friendliness and gather the data you need. 

During this time I might suggest creating a space for your users to provide feedback whether thats a survey of some kind or a loyalty program or even just a message board there are so many options.

ed_menac,"**UX is not about getting the design perfect first time around**. Even the best, most naturalistic user testing in the world won't answer your questions as well as seeing your product in the wild, and measuring **real** user behaviour (ideally alongside qualitative testing - so you don't misinterpret the numbers).

> push the product out in a reasonable state (fully expecting us to iterate many many times)

> getting a functional product out to meet business needs

From the sounds of it, your process is not mutually exclusive with the UX process. The two go hand in hand.

If you work in a very lean way, producing an MVP and setting it free in the world is the best way to quickly gather feedback and make improvements. The more time you faff around gathering business opinions and requirements, the less time your design is getting exposed to real users.

As long as you have a solid framework for gathering feedback and measuring metrics in the released MVP - these 'what if' questions should resolve themselves.

So the process should go like this:

1) Early user research to establish the personas and *basic* needs

2) Develop product quickly to meet critical requirements

3) Launch product, gather feedback on whether requirements are being met, as well as usability, engagement, and whatever else.

To use your social media icon example - it doesn't matter where you put the icons. Anywhere is fine. When the product goes live, perhaps nobody clicks on them because they're in the footer. In which case, you know and have evidence to support the idea that they need to be more incorporated into the page. Perhaps the click rate is healthy, in which case there was no need for all the panic about icon placement.

To go one step better than that, for really contentious internal debates, **just do both - A/B test it.**

One design gets footer icons, one gets sticky-sidebar icons. Which one improves engagement? Which one is a better user experience? The best design wins, and you've just avoided weeks of back and forth arguments in your team.

* The eraser works very well
* The pencil looks really cool

In this case, there are 2 positive features, and 1 negative feature that reoccur frequently. My suggestion is to look at the reviews in terms of features. If a review gives 1 star, and talks about how the eraser doesn't work well, the pencil looks terrible and the tip breaks frequently, then I would assume that its a biased review. If a review says that the tip of the pencil is sturdy and has never broken, and is looking at other features that no one else has mentioned, then i'd assume it is biased (positively).

thatgibbyguy,"Well so first off, good luck. Second off, good luck. Agile methodology paired with UX is difficult. But that's not what you asked.

In a nutshell, agile is a way to approach software development in an iterative fashion. So let's take a common software feature - a notification system. That feature will need UI with various states (active, hover, read, unread, etc), it will need front end (html of the components, css for the style, js for the interaction and control of state), and a backend (serve the messages, manage static states, etc).

Those will (hopefully) be described together in a gerkin style of english that anyone can read and know what to expect. 

After that, the entire team will come together and estimate the feature in points. Points are done according to fibonacci sequences, with 1/2 meaning a day of work, 21 meaning two weeks of work, anything bigger becomes an epic. These points represent the size of a feature in terms of complexity and also of priority. 

Now, you are the one interviewing for how to incorporate UX into agile, there's plenty of resources online for how to do that and I cannot give all of my skills away for free. But, at my company they are calling me a ""design technologist"" and what that really means is I'm a designer who also develops. That is important because developers know I know wtf I am talking about when I ask them to do stuff, and they know (think) I have them in mind when I'm designing. 

That means I can seamlessly fit into the scrums because I am as much a part of development as them.

However, don’t try to become a professional user research participant.  Now that I’m a client for user research studies, here are some pitfalls I see:

* Professional testers will often have “pet issues” that they will look for in any design.  For example, if they see a lot of e-commerce sites, frequent testers might notice or emphasize trust icons a lot more than the general population will.
* Professional testers will be so focused on trying to get into any study they can that they stretch the requirements and get into studies that they have no business being in.  I actually make my UserTesting studies start in one of two ways: 1) if there’s a screener, make the participant state why they qualify; 2) if there can’t be a screener (due to Individual plan restrictions), state a scenario and tell participants to get out if they can’t do the test from that scenario’s perspective.
* “Professional tester” is a terrible job from an income standpoint.  Professional testers (or crowdsource/MTurk workers) will be in a financial situation where they need to keep every dollar they can, so they’ll never be “likely to buy” expensive products that many of the websites that they’re testing want to sell them.
* There’s a degree of expert blindness.  As a UX practitioner (or UI designer or developer), you’re less likely to see a product the way that other users will.

In other words, as a client, I don’t want UX practitioners to test products I make.  If I wanted another UX expert to do a review of my work, I’d contact one specifically and order a teardown.  I also don’t want participants who have participated in, at the very most, more than a few studies per month or per year.

I still do participate in studies where I genuinely am in the target market for the product.  For example, I participated in a study for a user research vendor whose tools I was already using in my client work.  I’ve also participated in studies related to freelancing and the gig economy since I’m a full-time independent worker.

And I see a User Flow as the path a user follows through an application. I like to think of them as mini user journeys. The flow doesn’t have to be linear, it can branch out in a non-linear path.

keatenchase,"So the SUS only measures perceived usability/ease of use. It is not a good single measure for usability. Think of it as a good measurement for the emotional experience people have with your product.  

We have had plenty of applications where the SUS is high but the efficiency and effectiveness ratings are low and vice versa. Imagine a product that feels great to use but you fail every time you use it. 

Now the SUS is statistically relevant at 1 or 2 samples and it’s pretty airtight as far as a widely applicable, unbiased survey. I hope others understand that you need a collective chorus of data to determine usability.

oddible," #1 Ask for budget. At the very least you need these few things:

a) Set a specific number of investigation sessions you think you can accomplish in a quarter, get budget for them

* Skype, JoinMe, some desktop-sharing platform for communication both ways
* X # of client site visits per quarter - travel budget
* Honorarium for subjects in your demographic (surveys, studies, etc) - ranged from a $5 Starbucks gift card to $200 for a couple hour session
* Gift incentives to participate in surveys - a iPad or something like that

b) Get a usability testing platform. It is super cheap and being able to throw design ideas over the wall and get immediate feedback makes turn around on design ideas much faster: Usertesting.com, Validately, etc.

c) In-app telemetry and user feedback - I don't know what type of product you make but you need a way to collect analytics and to encourage feedback to make user research part of the ongoing operation of your product.  Google Analytics, Flurry, whatever.  For more advanced stuff consider Intercom.io or Apptentive or similar.

Lastly, lower the fidelity of your designs.  You can keep designing - and you have to in order to show prototypes to users and iterate, and do participatory design workshops - but you can't design at a high fidelity anymore - wireframes are your new style, not pixel-perfect, messy, hackery.  Just make it function.  Learn to live in simple tools like Invision.

It's only when companies get larger that more specialization makes sense, so people can be staffed on larger projects with a clear understanding of their role and they don't step on other people's toes.

* When asking questions in your surveys, try to stay away from leading questions that might taint your data.
* When running your user tests, make sure to present wireframes instead of a fully designed product. It will help to focus the conversation on the user experience instead of the UI design.
* It can be very helpful to look at apps that already exist in the space you're exploring to see what you like and what you don't like. You can then incorporate those findings in your own design.
* It's a good idea to make multiple designs, but I might recommend only showing your strongest prototype to users unless there is a specific UX that you want to compare to another. 
* It may also be helpful to create personas of your users. I don't tend to use them as much when designing, but they can be a good way to focus your design- and they look good in a portfolio.

Lord_Cronos,"I think there are a couple factors that inform why I find collapsing comments on reddit useful. 

1. My comment reading behavior in places where I use collapsing at all (large threads that I read a lot of) is almost always one single large reading session and very rarely if ever returning to the thread. If I do return it's almost always to specific comments that I either engaged with myself or wanted to follow as discussion continued, not to the thread at large. 

2. My comment reading behavior often simulates a conversational topic moving around a circle of people, one answering after another before moving onto another topic. This as opposed to simulating a series of separate conversations many of which continue onto other topics before I move to the next person's version of the conversation. 

If I'm doing this it means I'm only interested in comments at equal levels of threading at one time. First top level, then one down, then one more, and so on. Often I'll move on before going super deep. 

Since there are a lot of comments it's helpful to use collapsing to quickly restrict my view to an easily scannable list of comments at the level I'm currently reading. 

Since I rarely return to a thread after moving through it once, I don't think it would affect my use case much if saving the collapsed states was possible. The lack of saving certainly doesn't adversely affect it though. 

Am I explaining that well? ",1519448244.0

,"Nobody can answer this question for you.  Even years from now you will not be able to look back and say with absolute certainty where the other path may have lead, or whether that would have been better or worse than the course you took.  This is the human condition in a nutshell.

Know however that there is something independent of your circumstances that fundamentally makes you, you.  Your core identity is shaped less by the broad strokes than by the millions of finer ones.  How you fare in socio-economic terms may be deeply affected by a pivotal moment (like a job offer).  Who you are as a person will be less so.

Keep in mind too that your first job out of college is unlikely to make or break your career.  Many people transition in life, and you will likely have many opportunities to do so.

In practical terms most places will withdraw an offer after about a week unless you ask for an extension.  Most will grant an additional week or so for such an extension, especially if you explain your circumstance.  Few places willing to make an offer will judge a candidate for taking a decision too seriously...but they have business interests to consider and so cannot offer infinite leeway.

It doesn't matter if its a corporate environment or startup environment for your first role, what matters is EXPERIENCE. Choose the style of environment you would like to work in for your next job, not this one.

Even if the buyout goes ahead and you loose your job in the process at least you will have had a couple of months on the job, and you will be looked on favourably when the question comes around: ""Why are you leaving your current position?"" ""Retrenchment due to company buy out and restructure"".

This will make that second company take some sort of action. Whether they accept or reject you, you’ll know in time to make the appropriate decision with the first company. 

If you are given an offer by both, you should go with the company that offers the highest room for growth/career potential, which is sadly difficult to quantify.

oopiex,"My method is coming up with 3 usual ""paths"" that the user will want to take (user story), rate them by importance, convert them to a conversation (in my mind), and starting the design making sure they're all being answered, with the most important in priority on top of the others.

For example: The user wants to order a service to his apartment.
I ask him where he lives, which service does he need, when is a good time. just like a conversation. and then answer this conversation using the simplest / fastest UI elements that answer this story.

When thinking about User Interface as a conversation with the user everything becomes much easier.
",1519429692.0
,"I don't know if the team you work with actually work with Agile methods as they were supposed to. If they do, a user story is just a placeholder for a conversation. So, you go from user story through a discussion with all the right people to wireframes. Agile is meant to be highly collaborative and you try to avoid anything that is considered a handoff. 

On the other hand, if you are asked for wireframes (a typical deliverable without any value of its own really), that could be a telltale that this is really not an Agile project, and then you could complain that there aren't enough details in the specifications/requirements that they have named ""user stories"". 

In either case - start talking with your team. ",1519421270.0
otterfist,"I think your idea to put together available user data & use cases is a good place to start for wireframing. I follow a similar plan when I'm drafting out UI designs for a project: after finding out things like who the users are (think technical literacy & how often they'll use the system), what each type of user's responsibilities are, **and the barriers that prevent each type of user from completing their responsibilities effectively**, hopefully you'll have a basic understanding of what each user's workflow will look like with the new system. In my experience, the better you understand the users' workflows, the easier/more laid out your wireframing work will be.

One idea to keep in mind while wireframing is that most of the time, your wireframes aren't going to be what the final product look like, so it's not necessary to get them absolutely PERFECT for the customer. Of course you want to create them with regards to the requirements as much as you can, but it's usually better to view wireframes as a platform to gauge 1) how accurate the requirements gathering for the project was, and 2) whether the developers can actually make your ideas functional with the given time/budget constraints. From what I've seen, things can still go in any direction during this stage of the product life cycle, so it's crucial (imo) not to get attached to your work too much, nor to be a perfectionist.

This [UX Project Checklist](https://uxchecklist.github.io/) has served as a solid reference for me. I don't ever follow it to the dot, but it's got some good items that could make your work easier to do.",1519424383.0
,"Is there any research behind this that can indicate a connection between the advice given and a higher rate of success as an applicant?

I'm not meaning to imply that the advice is bad or wrong.  But contemporary UX is largely about eliminating assumptions based on anecdotes or 'common sense' with testable metrics.  It seems like this article is based mostly on the author's personal experience and taste.

I've helped hire a number of people myself, and associate with many others who have as well, and can tell you plainly that nobody I know gives a damn about your resume's line spacing or file extension, as long as it can be opened and read.  And while I personally like to see a hand-coded (or at least hand-styled) porfolio site, others prefer to see porfolios made using common frameworks as proof that the candidate knows when not to reinvent the wheel.

None of this invalidates the article's advice; it is merely to show that anecdotal advice will vary significantly.

If such research is available, it would be incredibly valuable, since most individuals lack the resources to gather such information, and only produce a handful of data points themselves.

There are of course many groups that have information on thousands and thousands of candidates and employers from which they can extrapolate success -- these groups have names like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Hired, and they do not eagerly share their research.",1519415548.0

,"Well if they aren't expecting anything, you could probably sit on your hands for a month waiting for them to pull their pants up without any serious repercussions.  But I'm guessing from your tone that you'd like to be more proactive.

The most important thing is what you're already doing -- cataloguing the most immediate and impactful changes.  I have a feeling you're the only person (other than the chapter-based users) who will care much about what's being bulldozed, so this is worthwhile in several ways.  Most importantly it gives you a context for the inevitable gripes and growing pains.

If that's not enough to fill your days, let's revisit the bit about SEO/analytics on the previous sites.  I think it's a fair assumption that they haven't done much research themselves, or that if they have, they haven't done so with a consistent methodology.  Doing a quick run at this would not provide you with directly comparable metrics, since as you said too many variables will be changing to know what went right or wrong with the redesign...but what you can gain is some context for success/failure and other goals or expectations.  This in turn can help inform decisions made in the immediate aftermath of the rollout, so that your efforts there are not purely reactionary (especially since, as you've noted, early data will be sparse).

Snizza,"It’s definitely been a struggle a bit. The culture where I work is embracing UX from the top down, but it’s taking a while to change the way development teams have worked for 20 years

Having a director or other top person champion UX and striving to change to a user centered design process is extremely helpful, but if that doesn’t work maybe having some small but visible “experiment” teams could work. We have a few smaller teams in our company that have been great examples of what UX done properly can achieve (they’re quicker than other teams, bring value faster than other teams, etc), and it can be useful to point at them and say “see? It works” 

I supposed that’s still selling it in a way, but it’s a more practical method that yields real results instead of saying the same old thing of “it cuts down on wasted development time, etc” they’ve heard over and over

rosstpope,"We have only in the past year managed to break through with User Experience in our company. We have countless stakeholders who just didn't appreciate the value in conducting good research and user testing designs. 

My personal breakthrough, was when I just went out and did some research about the audience that our stakeholders 'completely understood'. I booked a meeting to present back those findings and (as with a lot of research) uncovered some real points of insight that simply hadn't been thought of, or had otherwise been assumed wrong.

It sparked some interesting conversations, but having that genuine user research there to back up those points it was hard for anyone to argue. From that, I was given a bit more freedom to conduct some more research (fortunately for me my manager was on board too) and it snowballed from there.

My biggest problem I find is when people start at the solution (in my case editors/publishers) and you then have to work backwards to potentially unravel some of the ideas they had.

Most of my experience of getting people on board comes of involving them in the process where you can, taking them on that journey.

Doing research and just telling them something at the end isn't always enough to get buy-in. If you get the opportunity to run a usability study or do some interviews, try and get the sceptics involved for 1 or 2. 

I'm personally still quite new to this (a few years experience), but seeing a company break the seal of UX was a really interesting transformation to be involved it.

We still have many people in the business who still don't appreciate the value of it, or jump on the bandwagon and abuse it simply by dropping 'UX' into the conversation to seem insightful. We've had however had projects fail because stakeholders did not listen to direct user feedback and it backlashed (no surprises there).

msNaema,"Even though UX has been around for a long time people still don’t get it. Most use it as a buzzword. How many times have you heard people saying the “user experience of this site...” Unfortunately most companies or people see UX as ONLY visual design, we are there to make it look pretty :(

So we still have to sell UX. From my experience it’s hard to do when you are a UX team of one because you are too busy executing, trying to “feed” the scrum team.  Where I work now, they’ve never had ux but are hiring a team, so that is making it easier to sell ux because our manager has time to do that. 

But as designers we need to learn to talk “business” use things/concepts they will understand like numbers. Which I know ux designers don’t feel comfortable with. And I know numbers are hard to come by if you don’t have any analytics. 

So I might suggest trying to partner up with the analytics person at your work or if you don’t have one of those, try to get hotjar or crazy egg installed. That may be easy to get approved because it’s “metrics” 
I’m also trying to read all the customer support tickets and come up with numbers to help sway management. It’s taking time because our team is not fully staffed yet and I’m stretched thin.

After the design exercise/questionnaire I believe your profile (which consists of the exercise/questionnaire answers) is available for all potential hiring managers/teams to see.

4. Was notified that there was a team interested in me within the week of my challenge submission, but the recruiter was not able to reveal the specific team until I passed the technical design phone screen interview with a designer (not particular to the interested team) 

5. Technical design screen - asks question about general design process, past experience, future goals, potential design challenges, etc. 

6. Notified that passed the technical screen 

7. Moved on to be scheduled for the host match interview, found out there was more than one team interested and names of teams were given as well as potential projects

This question is definitely subjective, but IMO... **Best things about UX**: Learning so much different stuff about whatever product you are designing, ideation, research, working with a design team, creating a design system that works, having a budget, making people happy with your experience, learning about new ways of doing things, helping the sales/marketing or another part of the business. **Worst things about UX:** Lack of definition around UX profession as a whole- too many companies are asking ""do the UX for us"" without explaining *why*. Most companies don't even know what UX is and think it's making something look good. This allows graphic designers to get hired for UX positions without any research, interaction design, or iterative design aptitude. Lack of ethics, lack of budget for good research, lack of tools, lack of leadership- where, going back to my first point, companies expect a UX person to ""do the UX"" with little assistance from the team. Hefty deliverables can also be a bitch. Poorly communicated design = poor development/engineering.

6. Depends on the place. At a big company I've heard UX designers can make between $70-100k but smaller shops will hire for way less. A great designer can make much more and are much more desirable.

7. UX Intern > UX Designer (IxD, VisD, User Researcher) > UX Lead/Manager > Senior UX Designer/Design Principal > ???
Again it really depends on the organization.

8. Re-read your Psychology research methods literature. Learn everything you can about the design process, design tools, design people, and team composition. Understand UX responsibilities and current arguments for/against UX. Start reading ""The Design of Everyday Things"" by Don Norman. The business you work for will love that you have Sales and Psychology soft skills. Keep those in your arsenal.",1519233427.0

Depaysant,"Hey, congrats on the new job!

Re: software - My previous client used Hotjar - pretty helpful for creating heat-maps based on existing user patterns. I personally used Camtasia for screen capture - great because I can capture screen, video and voice all at the same time on one file, but I found it rather expensive as an independent designer. I have frequently used UXPin - although I was unaware of its usability testing functions. I have used it for both rapid prototyping and for importing higher fidelity UI assets from Sketch. If you're working on a very low-fi level though, just draw something on paper and import into Marvel or Invision to make it interactive. Never used Balsamiq, but apparently it's popular in the States. Which brings me to my next point - find out if your development/marketing team already has a software that they're comfortable with. I've met teams that are familiar with Invision and like it, so if they already have something like that, stick with it (unless you can find a strong case for converting). You also need to know what their expectations are. Some people like Framer because it can generate code; other developers hate it and never use it. 

Re: books - I have found Steve Krug's books (*Don't Make Me Think* and *Rocket Surgery Made Easy*) to be absolutely indispensable as a primer for conducting user research. They're also very easy to read (you can probably easily finish both in a day), but still very good to have on hand to refer to. Any other book recs depend on what you want to learn. 

Hope that was helpful!

I would first of all make it clear what info you need / want. So add a label to tell people. Also ideally a button says what it will do, so people know.

Instead of the button with the icon, you could also use a button with text depending on your audience (tech savvy or not) and the space you have. 

I don’t think there’s a need to initially hide the zip code field, unless you really want people to press the button. But if that is the case I would just solve by making a big “use my location button”, and having a link or something that says “add zip code” to open up the field (also circling back to what I said above: be explicit with buttons).

So the computer AI doesn't have empathy, but it would have the power of brute force and agility, which humans can't compete with.

Then again, perhaps there's too many free radicals with usability and interface design. Maybe it requires too much lateral thinking to be achieved merely by trial and error.

calligraphic-io,"Hopefully porkbun.com is reading this thread. It's a clever promo. I've meant to get a .design domain for a personal use for a while -- but the cobbler's shoes and all, I've bought and renewed a number of domains since I thought about doing it. Some UI issues I noticed with the site:

1. When I entered my address for the domain registration, I entered in a street address and the zip code. The city and state should have auto-completed: the zip code is sufficient to grab that information. And, the form is very American-centric. I live in Europe; we don't call them states here.

2. After I completed the $1.00 billing to my credit card, I was taken to a ""View Invoice"" page with a ""Thank You"" green-background alert box. I clicked on the domain name, expecting to go to a page to manage the domain. Instead, I got a ""Domain Not Found"" error - there's no reason to direct me off your site to the actual domain, and the site probably hasn't had DNS configured in any case.

Best of luck! Assuming there's nothing weird from this point in setting up the domain or renewing it, you've got my business.",1519070700.0

adyo4552,"Consider the product from your users’ perspective. What would they want to see or do on that sub? What would make them come back in the future, and what would make them visit once and never return? For example, do they care more about breaking news, or community discussion? These answers will depend entirely on your user base and are critical to the user experience.

One thing a UXer would want to do is research those users to get data that can answer the questions above, such as by doing interviews, focus groups, surveys, etc. Then we could synthesize that data into a “persona” that characterizes the typical user and for whom the product (the sub) can be improved for. For example, if data shows that users care much more about breaking news than community messaging, then to improve the site you (or someone else) could dedicate more time to adding content, so users come to associate that sub with timely news. Your research should also have given you some other insights, like what content they care most about, what their demographics are, etc, and you can cater more towards them.

Other elements to consider include removing barriers to use. For example, if you have an auto-mod that flags too many posts for removal (ironically like r/userexperience does), that can have a deflating effect on post quantity and community appeal. If your sub does not allow text-only threads, or requires posts of a certain word count, etc: all these elements can detract or enhance the UX depending on what your users want to see and do in your sub.

Hope that helps!

usbman,"Does the company have an existing product? Do a benchmark test on it, as well as a heuristic evaluation. If the product is flawed or has issues, it will show. If your stakeholders refuse to watch user studies, then make a super cut. I find that this works best on convincing stakeholders on focusing on a more UCD approach.

You have to educate your stakeholders that you are ultimately not the user, and that they are not the end user either. Until the product goes out in the wild, will you find flaws, bugs and errors. This shouldn't be hard to convince when you relate this to development. Explain that with testing you can at least cut down potential development time by getting to what the end user wants faster by truely understanding their goal. 

For some stakeholders, it will still be a hard sell. Mostly if budget is involved. My only suggestion then is for them to potentially try investing in something like usertesting.com or usabilityhub to do quick tests to make quick analysis of behavior which ultimately is better than no testing at all.

Also, there are no timed animations (animations which get triggered without user input, after some period).

In this sense, the lack of these specific functions can be easily coped with. But I guess if you're working in agency, often switching from project to project, these will pose a big problem because you will want to showcase such details to numerous clients.

I was on a homeowner interview to research how users interact with their thermostat and saw actual duct tape covering the controls — the homeowner DID NOT want anyone to change the temperature in the house. 

I started probing why - was it cost savings? Energy consumption?

Nope, it was 100% comfort-related. 

I started asking other homeowners in the research project about how they feel when someone other than themselves changes the temperature in the house; almost everyone said they did not like it at all. (I can’t say I blame them!)

This research led to a super quick implementation of a feature called “keypad lockout,” which started as an observation of a homeowner’s “unique” fix and is now used a ton in commercial buildings to keep people from messing with the temperature. A simple firmware enhancement went in to product development and now building managers don’t need to buy that stupid plastic box that covers the thermostat (and messes with temperature readings, but I digress).

The first subject completed the task without issue, but when completed said, ""ok, what now?"" Our team stared blankly at each other sort of mentally communicated ""oh shit are we idiots?"" We simply didn't think of building that into the prototype, the only way out was accessing the menu. We were so focused on individual features and crafting the tests that we completely forgot about what happens before and after users do something, how they might continuously navigate the app. For some reason that user saying ""ok, what now?"" sticks with me.

I learned my lesson. The next version of the instructions clearly said things like, ""the text of the contract is placeholder text,"" and, ""there is no need to read the feedback"".

Before you build a house, you need to have a plan for the structure and for what every room will be used for. If you don't make a plan, then the house may not work as well as it could. Your plan needs to include the people who will live there because they should get to decide if this room is the kitchen or the living room. 

UX is about making sure the person living in the house is happy with how it will turn out before you make it. You figure out what they want and then figure out how to best communicate that to the people who will build it.

Whilst I agree with you that it's an easy method for communicating to stakeholders and getting ""some"" results / insight...I still think it's a rabbit hole that should be avoided. This may be my cynicism but I feel as though stakeholders aren't as open-minded about the limitations of the score...and like you said, because it's such an easy narrative to paint a picture with, I wonder if it can lead to more harm than good. 

Your comparison to a weather forecast is great but there is still sound scientific methodology in forecasting the weather (measuring variables in the atmosphere and using historical data). This contrasts NPS where the science just isnt there. (A linear scale with non-linear meaning? WUT)

In a tight spot, I'd rather reframe the question to something people are more accurate about generally: past behaviors rather than future intentions. The question would then look like ""How many times in the past 6 months have you recommended [blank] to a friend or colleague?""

Then I would throw the absolute garbage binning out the window and analyze mean scores. It honestly blows my mind the NPS is analyzed in the way that it is; you learn in your first stats class you need a good reason to dichotomize a continuous variable.

PoorDaguerreotype,"Buy and read this book: Just Enough Research by Erika Hall https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research

It's aimed at small UX/UI teams and teams of one. It's a practical guide to processes and methods as well as providing excellent case studies and a guide to how to sell the importance of research and testing to your company. It helps you to prioritise which research/testing is relevant to your project and how to accomplish it with limited budgets.

It's a great read, super accessible and down to earth, yet is comes across as super professional and experienced. You can really tell Erica Hall has been doing this for years and her experience and confidence will help you to feel more comfortable with the concepts and approaches she outlines in the book.

Another helpful tool to sell the importance of UX practices to your org is anecdotes and success stories of how research and testing has helped to shape other products. For success stories and more process/methodology guidance I'd recommend Lean UX by Jeff Gothelf, and look out for talks and articles by Jared Spool.

Become a UX evangelist. Learn these stories and methods, talk about them whenever you can, try to steer conversations towards user needs and use examples of how understanding users has helped shape products, talk about how a little more time spent thinking and testing saves enormous effort and cost by reducing the amount of change needed when it's most expensive - at the end of the process once everything's been built.

winterisoverrated,"If you can find 2 laptops and 2 rooms you can do user testing.

Find some internal people as your participants (since you don't have a budget it's better to find people that don't bill their hours in your project). Ideally you would like to have people corresponding to your real user personas but it's still better than nothing.

So you're having the computer that will be used by test participants. You can use a free tool like join.me to broadcast sound and screen to the other laptop in another room. You need 1 person to help the participants in the test room. You should be in the observation room (any other room).

Ideally you also record what's happening on the screen of the participant (Camtasia can be useful but you can simply use Quicktime if you're on a Mac).

In one day, you can interview 5 to 7 person (1 hr sessions) and you'll get great insights about potential usability issues.

If possible, have one of the stakeholder spend some time in the observation room so they can experience the value of user testing.

If the user had their eyes closed, a couple nice and well positioned speakers, and were concentrating on the sounds I bet you could have them point pretty reliably to different parts of a monitor based on sound. 

But in the use case you're likely to actually get, I think low left and low right is the best you could hope for perceptually. 

It's an interesting idea!",1518715505.0
RebelQuaternion,"I would say that most desktop users actually use stereo speakers, 2 of them - left and right. (This is just my opinion)

So having 3 monitors could be mapped to having sound come from only left speaker (app on left monitor), only right speaker (app on right monitor) and both speakers (app on middle one).

This way our brains should be able to distinguish clearly between sources, and I guess developing a driver to map sound chanell based on monitor location should be rather straight forward. This could also work for dual monitor setup (without middle monitor use case).

Also, the software / driver must distinguish between alerts and multimedia sounds. So some sort of predefined settings should be available with options to define programs as ""alert producing programs"".

A few pieces of advice:

1.)  Be prepared to talk about what you've read, what classes you've taken, and how you've prepared yourself for the work.  On the subject of reading, I'd come prepared to talk about an article or book that you've liked, and one that you haven't.  

2.)  Be prepared to break down an app or site that you like, and one that you don't.

3.) Have some comfort talking about your ideal process.  As an example, my process is what I call the IDEA format - Iterate, Define, Execute, Analyze.  I talk about what should happen at each stage, the importance of testing at each stage, and how each stage logically flows into the next.  For an internship, I wouldn't expect you to have an in-depth understanding of your ideal process, but I would at least like you to be able to explain an approach and how it works.

4.) A usual question is ""What is User Experience Design?  How is it different from User Interface Design or Interaction Design?""  You should feel comfortable explaining your understanding of the differences between the two.

5.) Research the company, and come prepared with questions.  Good questions to ask about include current design initiatives, team culture, how the company defines itself within the industry, and how the company views the value of UX/UI design within the organization.

I hope that's some helpful study material.  Let me know if I can clarify anything!

And, of course, let us know how it goes.",1518473738.0

qukab,"I run a small design studio (3 full-time, 2-3 contractors at any given time) in NYC. Outside of typical running a business stuff, my day to day on the UX side looks something like this:

Generally I'm leading a standup or meeting on Mondays/Fridays (we try to not meet any other day, unless it's with users/interviews), consolidating research findings, sketching mockups & flows, creating prototypes, and working with visual designers to make sure they have everything they need. I also do a lot of Product Management for clients, as well as generally being the go-to contact for the client. 

I'd say my split is very close to 50/50 independent work vs working with others. As meetings are relegated to Monday/Friday, and generally very efficient (a lot of communication is done via Slack, Flow, Email, etc) we don't have to spend hours in meetings with clients. If I don't have a very good idea of how a client will react during a standup or progress review, something is very wrong. The working with others piece I consider less meetings, and more ideating, brainstorming, working through flows, usability testing, etc. The way we have our office setup and the way we run these exercises does not feel like a typical meeting. It's honestly the most fun part of the job. 

At the end of the day everything has been structured to feel productive, interesting, and meaningful. We don't waste time on things that won't move the goal post towards building success for our clients, which both sides appreciate. 

As far as learning goes, I read quite a bit. Books, Medium posts from other designers I respect, and other random sources. I know some people find meet-ups helpful, but I'm not in that camp. Generally they seem like a waste of time and are more of an excuse to hang out and drink. Nothing wrong with that, but it's not my thing. All that said, the best way of learning (for me) is simply doing the work, trying new things, and being open to failure. That doesn't mean allowing a project to fail, but being ok trying a new methodology on a project. Maybe we've read about something that's worked really well for another group of designers, and just because we have a tried and true method of our own doesn't mean we shouldn't experiment. If it fails spectacularly we'll eat the time on that and do it another way, but it's generally worth it. 

I feel extremely fulfilled. I love my job. As I've mentioned, we've optimized for only doing things that feel productive and meaningful, so there are very few things that cause burnout or frustration. Maybe the small running a business stuff, but most of that is automated (suck it up, get Quickbooks online, hire a CPA, invite them... and save yourself a massive headache... just ignore the shitty UX of QB as best you can). 

The best part of my job is the way I get to use my brain to solve problems creatively, learning things I wouldn't be exposed to otherwise, and working with really talented people. 

I don't really have a ""worst part of my job"", as if I did, I'd figure out a way to get rid of it. There are some recurring themes however in our industry that do frustrate me on the macro level. For example, ego is often a problem in design and with fellow designers. I'm in my mid-30's, so I'm well passed this being a problem personally, but I notice it quite often and it's something I go out of my way to try and curb in junior designers. Ego has no place in the design process, which is ultimately about your client and their users, not you. If you want to put ego into your work, do it on personal projects, or become an artist. Get over yourself, learn to empathize, and be mindful/thoughtful about everything you do when you're being paid to do it for someone else.",1518258923.0
eherschend,"I'm a UI/UX(product) designer with 3.5 years under my belt living in the bay area living the typical startup lifestyle.

My day-to-day consists of, prototyping, researching, talking to users, and designing UI's.

Probably 60% working independently and 40% in meetings.  I group talking to users into meetings.  

To stay current, I attend meetups (I live in the bay area which is helpful), visit sites like designernews and hackernews, and listen to design podcasts.

I'm in a startup so things move relatively quickly, I often feel like I don't have enough time to finish tasks but I guess that's the nature of the beast.  It's stressful at times, but the work is fulfilling.

I've heard working at bigger companies there is a lot of politics involved.  I, fortunately, don't have that issue at my current company because we're on the smaller side and autonomy is one of core values.  One thing that is difficult, UI/UX design encompasses so many damn disciplines and working in a startup environment doesn't let you explore the full process and spectrum of UX design which can be a little disheartening.

bishopanonymous,"Hi.

I'm a user Experience Designer rocking about 3.5 years of experience. The past 2 years have been with a fairly large marketing/digital agency in the midwest. More recently, my company offered me a position in London, so I've been working on the same project, just at a different desk (on a different continent).

Day to Day - 
I would say most of my days are focused on information architecture, presenting the IA and creative to various stakeholders, and recording/editing the requirement documents for the various products. On good days I get to sketch new ideas and ideate with team members. On great days I get to run user testing or synthesize research into actionable changes. This happens very rarely. 

% break -
Depends on the week. We work in sprints. During the approvals process (our client is particular) we have maybe 50-60% of our day filled with meetings. Some of these meetings are self inflicted, like Creative Reviews, or meetings to align on some new feature, or just to talk about ways we want to improve the product. 50-60% is the worst it gets, most days are closer to 30-40% meetings. 

Learning -
My company gives us a good amount of money to go to conferences, but I do not feel as encouraged as the last agency I was at. My current employer has purchased access for us to use Lynda.com, which I love and use frequently. 
My team has shifted lately, but we often have a good pattern of communicating what we see and hear as it pertains to our work. Some are big into new apps, others into emerging technologies, others film. We sort of cover a large gambit. 

Stimulated -
The HQ back in the midwest gets overworked more than the other offices do. I personally feel a lot of pride and a sense of accomplishment when we turn in all our work to a high degree on or before our timeline. I also love late night work sessions with my team. They can't happen frequently, but I enjoy them when they happen. The work culture in Europe is VASTLY different than the US. Sort of a different topic, happy to dive in if someone is interested. 

Like -
I love my team. My company treats me super well and they do interesting things. They're sort of a small fish compared to the other competitors that have been around for a long time, so we have a good energy. I hate how little my UX team fails to do UX. We all have good backgrounds in research, but we just - don't - do it. And it's making me disgusted.  I love more than anything the feeling of finding a great solution for a problem. That can be a creative use of existing design, a novel but familiar user flow, changing the order of operations to meet a development issue, or improving our process. The team/project/company has problems, but I always feel empowered to address them.

ed_menac,"To be honest, neither the title nor the description really mean anything in isolation.

On the whole, this seems like quite a sweeping job description, which could be a good thing or a bad thing. It all depends on the team. Are they looking for a T-shaped designer who is adept at visual design, but who can support other UX colleagues with research, business management, and analytics. Or are they looking for a single unicorn to tick off the corporate 'UX' box? If it's the latter, I would be concerned about a lack of understanding for the depth UX work requires. For one person to be solely responsible for all the above could be a nightmare, depending on the size of the company.

Since you have an interview already, they obviously think you match what they are looking for, so now you need to figure out whether *they* match what *you* are looking for.

The way to do this is simply to ask very directly about what your day-to-day responsibilities are. 

* Ask about the team you will be working with. Is it technical, or creative, or will it be a team of UX folk?

* Who is responsible for UX research? Who writes the copy?

* Find out the level of depth you'll be expected to define - are we talking mock-ups, or will there be pages and pages of specification documentation? Is it just screens, or will it be fully functional prototypes?

Their methodology, TLDR, is unsound, because they changed too many variables between iterations, and the title is misleading because they're really looking at _visibility_ of items and not the difference that flat design makes, per se. 

Anyone who's worked with Material Design guidelines knows that flat buttons are distinguishable by colour and placement, and the user can determine them via context. If you really want to, you can use shaded buttons, no-one is stopping you from doing that and they're included in most Material UI toolkits / libraries; you can even assign them shadows, but it'll drift away from 'orthodox' Material style. 

The key thing in the Material metaphor is that shadow depth is used intentionally; things that are more important are 'closer' to the user (i.e. the glass plane of the display) and cast bigger shadows, hence, the deeper shadow on the Floating Action Button, on items the user is interacting with, or on dialogs that must be dealt with before continuing, to name a few examples.

ajkandy,"Yes, it makes sense; as other people have noted, what you're trying to create is a pattern library (regardless of how the end product is actually coded / implemented) so you don't have to reinvent basic or common interactions or flows. 

That said, every client has unique requirements, and you will have to create variations on these patterns to suit the project. 

What might help is having a company-wide pattern library, which could be linked to code snippets / web components from actual projects to show implementations. 

Then, for your client project, you should import patterns as you go, to build up a customized pattern library for the project, which can contain the variations and document the additions / reasons for branching from the stock version.

As for tooling - there's very little out there that's really good at all this, but [Clearleft's Fractal](https://fractal.build/) is good for web components and snippets, documented as part of a build system, and [Frontify](https://frontify.com) is a good web-based style guide system with a GUI (subscription-based service), aimed primarily at designers but it can handle code snippets as well, referencing your own stylesheets externally.

whys_wise,"Hey! I'm one of the organizers of The UXR Conference in Toronto, this year, have been doing UXR for about 5 years and know a ton of people who hire/have hired UXRs.  
Most employers don't understand the role of the researcher. That makes hiring one who isn't senior very risky. The aren't sure you'll understand how quickly a tech product team works. They are unsure if you'll be able to communicate your findings effectively, and they're unsure if you know enough about the field. Overcoming those objections is the biggest challenge you'll have breaking in, and its why everyone wants to hire researchers with 3-5 years of experience.  
Here's how I recommend you do it. Do some UXR work on products everyone knows, and right them up as case studies on Medium.  
Then cold email product leaders at companies you'd like to work with. Tell them you're an aspiring UXR, send them links to your work and ask them if they'd be willing to learn more about your work.  
Your goal is to get a few pro-bono or cheap projects under your belt. The goal is to build trust with these people so they'll give you a referral or agree to hire you (as an employee or contractor).  
From there, you just got to hustle through cold outreach and referrals as much as you can.

Your best bet is to find a UX research agency, and talk yourself into a research job.

As soon as you have a year or so experience on the job (in which time learning UX principles) you should find a lot of doors opening.

Agencies are the best target because they hire a number of researchers and the projects have shorter lifecycles. This means they are more likely to take on a junior, and you'll get to earn a lot of experience very quickly. Small agencies may also find your PhD attractive as a marketing tactic.

- Consider a big-name employment, even temporarily. Getting in with a a big tech company goes a long way, for several reasons. First, they know what a UXR is and how to use them, so you can get projects right away. Second, other people will see your value if that big name tech company did. Most have internships for current students, and any hire freshly minted PhDs. Consider: Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce. Also consider Amazon but they would likely use you in a pure quant way.

- Attend UX events, including conferences like IA Summit, UXPA, EPIC, and Enterprise UX. 

- Find your specialty: every UXR is an expert in something. You're lucky in that you have quant skills, but they must be married with some kind of subject matter. Do you do analytics really well? Do you measure usability really well? Do you do user interviews really well? Find something you do really well, and make it relatable to the UX product lifecycle. That way,  you can say, ""Oh, when you're testing products just prior to launch, that's where I can really help."" Or, ""When you're optimizing existing products, that's where I can really help.""

One last thing: cold calling is a LOT OF WORK. So yes, by all means, do your own product research on the side, and yes, publish it. But be aware, it's unlikely to lead to a job alone. Cold calling is a very inefficient way to get a job. Good luck!",1517838703.0

ed_menac,"No, you really need to push back on this stuff.

You could spend every waking minute documenting every scenario and behaviour - but if you're anything like most designers, you have a million other things to be doing. Babysitting developers is fine if you're only on one project, but I had to learn the hard way that it isn't sustainable.

What you DO need to do, is communicate a FEW, KEY, COMMON states. Pick the most likely user scenarios and plot these out. Maybe:

* happy journey
* error state
* failure

Your goal is to have as FEW states as possible, while still accounting for the major user needs. As /u/iamadsgnr has said, this is where personas come in useful. ONLY plot out the scenarios your personas need. There really shouldn't be anything left which is significant.

Remember that you're building the product for **most of the users, most of the time**. If you're spending all your time thinking about the most niche, hypothetical scenarios, you're not doing your job.

Whenever you get asked 'what if...?' by a developer - use one of the states you have already demonstrated.

Sorry that this has come across quite harsh. I'm just really loathe for someone else to fall into the same pitfalls I have had to drag myself out of in the past.

A couple notes/tips:

- I find that intl, business trips happen at the early stages of a project, when you’re gathering requirements and are deep in research
- Senior designers can travel to present work (or collaborate when work is underway), but, directors are usually favored for travel during those early stages
- Grow and expand beyond your core UX skill set, strategy fields are key. It’s usually more fruitful to send talent overseas if they bring a greater breadth of perspective to the table.
- Have great client-facing skills as you’ll likely spend plenty of time with key stakeholders (either traveling/learning together or presenting your work)

icanfly,"As someone in the innovation field there are several traps you can fall into.

1. We have this cool tech, make something cool with it!
2. We need to innovate! Go!!!

So in number 1. It's about finding scenarios that can be driven by the tech.

In number 2. The question should be asked 'what problems are we trying to solve' or 'what business space are we trying to disrupt'?

If you don't have clarity, inform yourself. What are the business goals. What are the product offerings, where can you push at the bleeding edge? What new tech will enable new scenarios that previously resided in the realm of fantasy.

You can't just say 'innovate' and expect it to get you anywhere... do yourself the favor and start making statements about the spaces you're spending time in. This can often give others something to editorially respond to. This can be easier than asking 'what should we do""?

As for working with remote teams. You just have to take the extra effort to ensure clear communication. If you are working with a remote team, change your schedule or get others to share the conversational loads with you. It can work, it just introduces significant risk into the project hat you've got to spend cycles mitigating, that could be spent elsewhere... that costs money and money is easy to understand when you talk about we can do 3 things with remote team for xcost vs. 4 things with local team for less than xcost.


Hope that helps",1517604635.0
nMoc,"So, I'm assuming you're a designer. How far are you in the process? Is it still just a business idea or do you have some ui or working prototypes going?
To me, this sounds like a classic issue with companies who wanna 'innovate' yet don't know which problems they're trying to solve - worse yet, maybe the problem isn't even worth solving. I've been in the situation and it sucked. 

I would say you could do 2 things:
1) Yes, you can try to convince the management that user testing and (hopefully!) some kind of market validation / defining needs is the way to go (the Lean MVP approach or Jobs to be Done-methodologies comes to mind). For that to work, you need some powerful communication skills, and you gotta be able to understand and talk 'bizness'. Management only thinks about growing the business, hitting the numbers and keeping their promises to stakeholders / board of directors. And they couldn't give a damn less about 'the right process' unless it will yield a turn of investment. And fast. So have that in mind. In your presentation, maybe throw in a few examples of companies that've gone wrong by launching worthless / complicated crap. I think there are some examples in a free book from a Google guy called 'Pretotyping'. Also, feature some products that came out of a good process and why it makes sense.

2) Ask yourself - what are the unknowns for you right now? What's blocking you? What's constantly on your mind, you need doing? Then go ahead and do you work you feel is necessary doing this thing right. 
Problems with usability or no customer need for the product will come back and bite you - you're the designer, it's you're responsibility all the way through. In an environment like this, you gotta run with it yourself: set up those interviews, reach out to allies in the organization (sales are often in close contact with customers), build some quick prototypes and do some internal testing with people or with customers. Test with whomever you can find. Remember to document it all. If you can, get video recordings of tests or interviews. At least get pictures of the people you've talked to and capture some quotes. All your documentation will serve as justification for your way of doing things. Now base your designs on the real needs of the users and keep your management in the loop of this. Show them you are proactive and that you're able to make smart business and design decisions for yourself.

As for working with remote developers, I understand you. In my view, it's limiting the speed-to-market and increasing miscommunication. But those are the terms. Always keep the engineers in the loop, especially the front-end guys. Perhaps set up regular check-ins or calls with them to make sure you're on the same page and to be aware of the technical constraints. Share your work early and often.

I read a book once called 'the ux-team of one' or something like that. Might be worth checking out.

Hope that helps. Good luck

acherryghost,"To make sure I understand: your company has a new product, unreleased and untested, and they’re asking you to improve on it? That’s absolutely bizarre.

If there’s anything a company’s higher-ups would understand, it’s the bottom line. They just need to understand that without adequate research resources and testing, they’re VERY likely to end up shipping things that either:

A) nobody needs
B) are needed but don’t suit the people who need it
C) could require *massive* rework later on

All of which equal capital sunk into net loss. This is not just possible, without research, it is highly likely to occur. Google around and I’m sure you’ll find examples of this in the real world, as this is the story of basically every failed product.

RatherNerdy,"I'd argue that with this design you are forcing users to pogo-stick through the experience, meaning they are less likely to find what they are looking for. Pogo-sticking refers to clicking into a product to get any information and then having to go back to the result set over and over again; it's a quick way and surefire way to frustrate users. At an absolute minimum, you need the product name & price. 

Using an alternative shopping metaphor, imagine walking down a shopping aisle where the boxes of product only had pictures on the front of the box and the product name, description, and price were on the back of the box. With this design, shoppers would need to grab a box off the shelf to look at the back to get any information. Imagine how frustrating that would be for the shopper. Would you shop there?",1517494531.0

- Have the name of the product overlay the image (con : can make it hard to read, you might need to play with contrast which can lead to dark images), and have it be underlined. Nothing says ""click me"" like underlines.

- Have a set piece of text overlay, like ""view details"" (con : same as above, but easier to control since the text is set)

- Replace your text intro, before the image list, by ""click our products to know more"" (con : people don't read words, and it's not very elegant)

sachio222,"If this is all you present to the user, it works. Definitely.

1. They are literally one exploratory tap from figuring out what works
2. The lack of other options makes it clear that the interaction is in the content.
3. The alternatives are few: a: They think they're in an image gallery in which tapping on an image would zoom. b: They want to find out more information about one of the images, in which case they are motivated to act, and with the lack of other navigation signifiers they will tap. c: They want to return from where they came from. So they will look to tap somewhere not on the images. 

TLDR: Yes. It is enough. 

edit: 
Remember the user intent. If they picked up your app, it is because they wanted something. If they didn't want that something, they wouldn't have picked up your app. If that thing they want is shopping, and the only option you give is product images, you are golden. I want to tell you this will work definitely, but I want to tell you to easily build two very simple prototypes using marvel app, invision or proto.io. One with price label, and one with product only. See what users prefer. Users often want to price shop without having to go too many clicks into the experience.

Recruiters for UX care more about you knowing how to do rapid prototyping than you being able to code (rightly true that some places are looking to hire UX/devs, but it's still an expected skill)

The second part of my thought is - why is this UX? Did you do user discovery to find out what problems people had when buying skateboards? Did you test the usability of this new design, and then reiterate it? In UX, process is just as important as outcome, if not more important. Having something that looks great without all of that user research makes you a UI designer, not UX.

as a ux designer, you immediately want to ask: who'll see this page? when? why? (do we need a home page like this in the first place?) how does this layout behave on smaller/larger screens? who manages the hero content? how? (does it support additional imagery/text?) what happens when you click on either of the sections? what does the shop look like? (and how does it tie to this intro?) won't there be more sections than just the three? how does the search behave? is search on this site really so useless/unnecessary to be sidelined like this? where do i manage my account/how do i log in, sign up, log out?

For a while, I was the only UX supporting 4 dev teams across IOS and android. It was for one product but each dev team was working on different parallel features. It was impossible to deliver good UX as I had to constantly switch context to support the developers and PMs. That left me with barely any time to think, focus on quality or do user testing / research. 

As designers we are also often the only ones regularly look at the product in a holistic manner. When you spend all  your time running from dev team to dev team, you lose focus on the bigger picture and the product suffers. 

Not sure how it is for you exactly but having more than 1 designer is always a good idea. ",1517445632.0

While I mainly rely on my knowledge/experience to make recommendations and generally steer the developments through some kind of user-centric design process, I do try to user test things where possible (even if that just means ""human test"" things using our QA team or other volunteers).

I take a long view on my position, in that I want to try to shepherd my company to a higher level of design maturity. So as well as doing ""proper UX"" work, I consider it an essential part of my job to educate my colleagues in user centric design principles and persuading management of the value of design thinking.",1517446993.0
ed_menac,"Yep, right now I singlehandedly support 4-5 development teams across 3 completely discrete products. It's hell. 

The optimal arrangement is one product per designer only. You will produce the best designs and the best products by not spreading yourself so thinly.

The reason is that every 'extra' project you have to be involved with will multiply out your workload disproportionately. Switching between projects takes a lot of mental effort:

* It's twice as many meetings

* It's twice as many requirements and restrictions to be aware of

* You end up wasting your design time agonising about which tasks you 'should' be prioritising

* You cut corners and gloss over issues (as much as it pains you to do so)

* You 'satisfice' instead of aiming to find the best solutions

* There's less time to research and iterate, or to review your own work

In my experience all this has meant I basically am more of a 'consultant' than a designer (because I barely have time to make a wireframe, let alone polish or code a front end design).

Beg your supervisor/manager to hire another designer, or to limit your scope. It's not a good idea to expand your remit even further, unless you actually **want** to pursue more of a 'consultant' role and do less hands-on UI/UX.

thedigitalmonkey,"There are plenty of options in terms of Undergraduate Degrees in Design which are close to what you would want to study as a UX designer - Interaction Design, Service Design, Systems Oriented Design, Experience Design and many variants offered as ""Bachelors in Design"", ""Bachelors in Science"" or ""Bachelor's in Arts with Honors"" formats. You can check a website like QS Top Universities to get a good idea of the University ranking. There are definitely a lot of good schools in Europe which have made it to the top 50. (Although most of the top 10 is US followed by UK). 

It might seem like a lot of work but it helps if you go through the curriculum of the course offered at each university and talk to students/faculty/alumni to see what the experience was like. You should also consider seeing what people have done after they took the degree (LinkedIn profiles) to understand how well they are doing. And like you said there's no need to do Undergraduate studies in something very broad when there are so many good design programs. A good program should also give you a really good understanding of design that will help you easily make a switch whenever you choose to. I know plenty of graduates who go from Industrial Design to Interaction Design or something else based on what interests them. Once you know the basics it's not too difficult to re-tool yourself.

starlight_midori,"With UX design, maybe you could look into a degree like graphic design, web design/development, or some other tech-related subject... but mostly to have an ""art/design"" background if you're lacking that area or something tech-related to get your foot in the door of the area of UX. It's also important to have some skills for user experience (e.g. photoshop, html, javascript, etc) and an outlet for people to view your work (whether a portfolio or website). Portfolios are important, so create one even if you're not instructed to. Make up a fake app or redesign an existing program/app and make sure you document your creative process, not just the final product. Another thing that would help is to see if there are UX people around your area that you can talk to or shadow just to have an idea of how they got there and what they do, and also look online for UX designers and email them (you might be surprised that some have come from an entirely different career field). It would also help to communicate with faculty (at the schools you want to attend) who work in UX and ask them for advice.

I'm currently working towards my masters in HCI, and what I did was complete a bachelors in psychology because it was more realistic for me to do that at the school I attended (I have no art skills and my university's tech department I heard wasn't that great so I avoided that area), plus psychology was something I had interest in. A bachelors in psychology will give you a good background for the ""human"" side of UX, even though like you said, there will be subjects that are irrelevant to UX; however, if there's a degree for human factors, I think that would be your best option. IA and IxD can also be useful, and if you feel like you're not exactly learning what you want, you could utilize free courses (like on coursera) and learning material online to fill in those gaps; also consult with your counselor or an instructor once in college about your plans if you worry that IA and IxD won't help broaden you. Some of my classmates in my HCI program come from different backgrounds (from English/literature degrees, business, computer science, graphic design, and even biology) and they're either looking to learn more about UX or just embarking on a fresh start on a new career path, so don't worry too much about getting there, but you will find a way and get there eventually, especially with your motivation. I'm not too familiar with the education/universities in Europe (I'm from the US), but make sure you do your research on the bachelor programs of the potential schools you want to attend. As for US schools, there are some online bachelor programs (that way you don't have to physically be in the US for them), but I'm not sure how credible they are. The same with master programs.. so if you're thinking about studying online, really do research the school lol.

luxuryUX,"3.5 years of experience and an HCI degree should be competitive enough for you to start contracting if you are approaching it the right way if you are interested. 

I've said this before on this sub, but contracting can be pretty very lucrative in UK. If you have experience in Gov, fintech or banking you can command a day rate of £500-£600 as a midweight UX working in these industries and most of these contracting position are outside of IR35, so you are not taxed at the same rate as a full-time employee. Contracting isn't for everyone and you really need to be good at your job and entrepreneurial about your career (networking and self-promotion play a big part) but if you are looking at your next career move from a strictly financial standpoint, I'd suggest looking into contracting. Another good thing about contracting is that you have flexibility in your career in terms of choosing when and where you want to work. But there are drawbacks such as having to be very diligent on your taxes, paperwork/organization, no funded pension or dental etc.

Majority of full-time salaries in London are so-so when compared to global tech hubs and especially considering the cost of living in London. Edging up on 4 years experience and a legitimate HCI degree you should be able to command £50-£55k or a bit more. I know folks in Leeds, Newcastle, and Bristol making £40-£45k with ~2 years experience, usually coming from a psych or sociology background. The competition in London is a bit stiffer but don't sell yourself short taking anything less than £50k with that much experience and a legit HCI background.

DrieStone,"A lot of good answers here. I will put my two cents in. I personally think that a good UX designer should have at least a passing knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS if the destination platform is web based. Namely, the end result will be developed using those technologies. Knowing what is possible and what is not is vital to developing good design patterns, especially if there are constraints. Knowing the level of difficulty of implementation is important.

That said, I have done all of the following:  

1) I've wanted to explain a concept that my prototyping tools can't adequately show. I can drop over to codepen or even just build some static webpages. This is especially valuable to show how some responsive design patterns might look. There's the added advantage that you can use REAL libraries to show how it should work. This provides something that's closer to a 1:1.

2) Related to the above, I've developed live front-end code to do some more complex designs because most of the team I work with has limited front-end experience.

icanfly,"As others have said - it depends on company/team/context. 

However, in my experience, the UX Lead is on the hook for whatever they are leading. You can be a feature lead, a product lead or an ecosystem lead. Regardless, you are the one that is ultimately on the hook - you own vision, you drive alignment and own discussions across groups. You then drive the daily operations around your practice and deliverables with your immediate team and partner teams. 

You do so while ensuring that your team(s) have clarity of vision and that your stakeholders align to said vision. You then Shepard that vision from concept to final delivery. 

Another key element of being a UX Lead is cultivation of Jr. talent on your team. This, to me, is one of the more important aspects of being a Lead. Showing vs. telling providing opportunity to your team to succeed/fail/learn/grow/improve and most importantly, contribute.

alexduckmanton,"Try to think of it from your customer’s perspective. They’ve probably been in business for a while. Surely they know what their customers want/need because otherwise they’d have gone broke long ago. 

Doing research for a design really never ends. How do you *know* this dropdown list is bad? From your client’s point of view, your opinion is just, like, your opinion man. Do some research and show them that it’s a bad idea.

If you devise a test and show that making this change will affect conversion rates (i.e. cost the client money in lost sales) they will change their minds. And in the process you’ve demonstrated that when you make a recommendation it’s not coming out of thin air. Over time they’ll trust you more.

If you don’t have the time for user testing, try to think of a way to compromise between the two versions. In asking for this new version the client has really given you two things — a problem and a solution. Their solution is bad, but the problem is real. They have a bunch of extra actions they need to add the the UI. Is there a way to include a clear CTA while still including the other options as secondary actions? I bet there’s a way to compromise.

As for portfolio pieces, there’s nothing wrong with using an earlier draft if you’re not happy with the end result. But an even better thing to have in your portfolio is exactly this situation.

Thaenor,"Every designer/UX seems to struggle with this issue. I’m not a designer or UX... but I did a workshop on that and I remember everyone complained on that issue at some point...

The thing is you can't go with a “prove them wrong” mentality, that just makes it worse. You gotta make people think they believe your suggestion is their best idea. Obviously this is easier said than done and ultimately depends on what they like. Maybe their choices stem from seeing websites that “make lots of money” and try to copy them. Maybe they make those design changes because their favorite website does them, for better or worse... 

One if you can do, assuming they’re the “business” type. Is to show some data, try to get your hands on some site analytics that prove your design decision works best. And if that doesn’t work, indulge them but suggest and A/B test with your design vs their design, and ultimately let the data speak for itself.

What I ultimately think, is that if you want “artistic integrity” and having things your way... then forget business. It sucks for me to say this but truth is you never get to expose your true creativity and “do things your way” without concessions when you’re working under other people... if you’re ballsy enough then start your own business, if not try to find a good middle ground where everyone is happy.",1516877148.0
DrieStone,"Rule number one when you're doing graphic design is that you have to be prepared for feedback even if you don't agree with it. It's one of the toughest thing to handle. You spend a bunch of time getting your project built just the way you like it, and someone comes in and upsets the balance.

Consider the following: If they're asking you to change structural items, then the requirements weren't clear, or you misinterpreted them. UX is not about ""looking beautiful"" or something that can be ""shoehorned in"". UX is about anticipating user needs and making sure that your software appears as transparent as possible. 

So... if there are 240 changes for your project, then 1) Management is changing their mind at the last minute, or 2) The site was never really ""almost about to go live"" because all the stakeholders didn't have time to review.

This post comes off as ""my beautiful piece of portfolio work is being ruined by the CEO"", you need to get out of that mindset and concentrate on what the best thing for your user is... not the best thing for you. 

What I would do... if I was in this situation, is start with user stories. Put together a list of the top 10 things that users want to do on your site and walk through that process. Share that with the stakeholders, and get them to buy in. THEN you can make your case for elevating certain features. ""As we agreed this wasn't one of the primary user needs, and elevating it to that position actually makes user story #1 and #2 more complicated.""",1516888274.0
JarasM,"> The latest example is a nice simple, clear call to action regarding ticket purchases which they want to change to a dropdown list with non-priority items in it!?

Some business people, especially small or family run I feel, have an ""everything's important!"" approach. What is the core target group? Everyone! What age bracket? 5-100! Income? 0-Bill Gates! Which are your most important actions during ticket purchase? All actions are important! You need to clearly explain that it's not possible to focus on everything - because then you focus on nothing. You need priorities, you need structure. That is the design, this is what they pay you for in the end: to find out what's important and devise an approach to visualize that to their customers. Provide an analogy they can understand, for example priotizing your tasks if you're working on documents and you're overwhelmed.

In the end, if you don't have the authority where the customer trusts you to make the design perfect yourself, you need to explain your design decisions in a language they are able to understand (they need to know what is the benefit behind your decision). And even then, it's best to explain to them anyway, so that they understand what they pay for.",1516885518.0

Likewise, with Facebook, you can use it as a place to connect with people, message them and simply use it as a supplement as an extra form of contact or you can use it as a place for negative discourse and keyboard wars.

Are you going to allow multi-selects for users/categories/etc? If you don't, then an autocomplete or a drop down is probably best. 

Depending on the available room (mobile vs. desktop), you may want to consider dropping all of this into some kind of modal view (especially if you want to do a multi-select). This gives you plenty of room let your filter area breathe, it also allows you to reclaim the area you were reserving for these filters inline. The downside is that you don't allow the user to see the result without dismissing the filters.

Notstrongbad,"Do you have any old PSDs/mockups saved? That would probably be helpful. 

What about the usability analysis? Depending on the methodology used, you can expand it into a case study and showcase the decisions you made and the measurable impact they had. 

The most important thing about a UX Design portfolio is not shiny mockups, but PROCESS. If you can pick 3 solid projects you’ve done, detail the process you went through, any research you did, testing, ideation, sketches, data, and then show the results, you are going to have a solid portfolio.  

I think after 5 years you’ve done and learned a bit more than you give yourself credit for. 

Google “best UX portfolios” or some such terms, and you’ll find plenty of examples. 

Where do you live? Do you have an active UXPA chapter nearby? You could go to meetups and network. You can ask for advice and hear about new jobs. 

It sounds like you’re not really being challenged. Do you have time to pick up a side project? Even  the “fake” projects (pick a business/app/site, analyze and improve) can give you a bunch of good experience AND show potential employers your method when approaching a design problem.

toucan_sam89,"While I really like the thought process and how the author works us through the value issue (which I get), I have two thoughts:

1) The author seriously ignores the sentiment undermining his entire argument: It is ultimately users that (in time) create the social systems they use, therefore designing an open-ended platform with certain values in mind only serves to reinforce that notion. The small point he mentions about asking whether or not it is possible to create an unbiased platform is a major issue here - the answer is simply no. Unless you make a 100% sandbox, this is not possible. An analogy might be AI or machine-learning. We can't ever make it objective because we (the creators) aren't so. 

The reason that his analogy to platforms like meetup and couchsurfing doesn't hold up is that these platforms are -inherently- value based, not primary spaces where opinions and attitudes are shared. They're different tools. 

2) As a writer (and reader), I would suggest he tone down his use of italics. It removes meaning from the terms that he's trying to emphasize when used too much.",1516299311.0

TriskyFriscuit,"> Is there such a thing as a 'pure' UX role where you can do nothing but test and design in a vacuum without interference

How could you possibly be an effective designer if you are existing in a vacuum? Talking to stakeholders, ushering your designs along to engineers/dev teams, gathering business requirements, and helping with strategy are insanely important - just as important as the design itself, in my opinion. ",1516201792.0
bleedcmyk,"I wouldn't expect to only be able to do the hands-on design aspect of my job at any level but a junior level. 

Responsibility and title increase proportionally and the expectation for a UX Designer to at some point coordinate with Project Managers, Product Owners, manage Clients and Stakeholders and do Design Strategy are all inevitable as we grow more and more experienced.

Building these soft skills are important for the career development of a designer. Consider that your end-game in this career path is likely to either own an agency, or be a design director for a large company. When you are doing either, do you also expect to get down in the trenches and draw boxes in sketch?

You absolutely can work as a specialist in design. I've been hired for short term projects to do just a very thin slice of a project (such as building a visual design language, or generating presentation assets like video mocks) as a business alternative to hiring a full fledged agency to do the same thing. But is it sustainable to always be the hands and never the direction? Hands are cheap. ""Unicorns"" are expensive.

RiotMontag,"At the end of the day, my job is to get something out the door that's good, and if part of that is making sure my team's aligned up and down on the priorities and the details, I do it in whatever way works best for them and for me based on where we are in the project. I consider the designing-at-my-desk part more fun, personally, but professionally I treat all the ""business admin"" activities as necessary to do ""design,"" and they ultimately make my design-at-my-desk work better and the end product better in the long run.

The ""pure UX"" role you're describing might be personally fun, but I'd argue it wouldn't result in very good work over time.

EDIT: Wanted to add, if you feel like there are aspects of those interactions that could be streamlined, that might be worth discussing with the stakeholders or teams so they're getting what they need and you only have to spend so much time on it. If there's a person you work with who's responsible for work process, this is very much in their wheelhouse.

As another angle (and somewhat unintuitively), sharpening your skill at leading or participating in meetings can make them go much faster and allow you to spend more time on other things. There are lots of resources online to learn from. I've read a lot of [Vervago skill sharpeners](http://www.vervago.com/skill-sharpener-library/) (warning: suuuuuper dry, but the techniques are good once you translate them into real-people-speak). Sometimes refocusing a meeting on one good question can drive the conversation to a productive end much more quickly, and you'll be adding a lot of value for your own design work by clarifying stakeholder needs or team priorities with more precision.",1516204139.0

Automation/ machine learning is not good at solving novel problems when past experience is only obliquely related to a new task. It is also not well suited towards social tasks (interpreting and responding to people). That is not to say that they never will be capable of these things, but I’m confident careers dealing with novelty, uncertainty, and social interaction will be dominated by humans for my lifetime.

I've not seen it since, and that's just basic design work... 1 image and 1 caption.  

Good luck on simulating UX via computer because, for starters, it takes me hours and days to source requirements from customers that don't even know what they want.

ProperBald,"No way are you failing! **Knowing** code is a skill you should pursue, but you definitely don't have to enjoy it. In fact, there are so many designers we interview who have no idea how to read code syntax much less write it.

My career progression started in smaller companies where I was asked to do both the design and front-end dev, but those positions are becoming fewer. Usually your heart lies either in code or design. While some people may be skilled at both, their work will show where their passion is. Anytime someone tells me they can both code and design my next question is which do you do better and which do you enjoy. People who are wizards at both are *extremely* rare, and I would raise an eyebrow at companies expecting you to do both extremely well.

Keep expanding your knowledge of code though. Even though you can't stand it, knowledge of code will make you much more marketable once you're out of school. Yes, you may have to work a job or two where you do both, but as your career progresses you'll need to choose one side or the other. For example, at one of my first jobs I did everything from wires and comps to JSON packets, API integration and PHP based content management systems. At times I hated coding. My next job was a little more senior where I did very little coding, but that experience with code gave me extra knowledge into how true developers think, the problems they face, the solutions they face, how they work, etc. Now as I design I can save time because I know how I would code it, or I know things to avoid because I know things a true front-end dev would hate. My current job I do little to no coding.

Anyways, longer reply that usual but you seem torn up about this. Keep at it! There are **plenty** of jobs out there for people who don't want to code, at companies both large and small.

Oh, and yes, tools like InVision, Principle for Mac, Framer, etc are perfect for the path it sounds like you're wanting to take.",1516054932.0
vunilla,"Uhhh, you probably won't ever need to code as a UX designer. It's great to be able to speak the language to someone who will be probably be coding and developing, but it's not required by any means even at a startup. I know MATLAB/C++, but you aren't going to see me spend any outside time on it via personal projects. I dislike it, but realize it's important to have ""general"" knowledge of it for the future and also helps me think from a developer's perspective.

 Also, they have two different methodologies in thinking. Designers think about the user from a humanistic-approach, goal driven perspective and developers have much more functional, specification/implementation perspective.

‘If you want to be a UX Designer, you have to know how to code so you can deliver already coded prototypes which makes it easier and faster for the front-end developers to integrate your design and to understand your animations.’

That's complete BS. If developers can't understand your designs from your prototypes or low-fidelity wireframes... well, you need to do more learning as a UX designer.

Continue on the path that you're on, with learning UX skills: interaction design, information architecture, and user research.  

Since you studied graphic design, you may have some trouble convincing people that you're a real UX person unless your portfolio strongly demonstrates UX skill (as opposed to UI skill - very different!).

Do that, but make sure you do not put blame. Explain factually and impartially, making clear how you did what you could. You will want to avoid leaving yourself open though, so for example we all know feature bloat is a problem in many projects, but it could be argued that the bloat was a problem that you didn’t identify and discuss with management in time, so why couldn’t you find a compromise or stop it? Have good answers for that because any good interviewer will ask!

For example, I worked on a project for a major U.S. county.  The county's CEO stepped down in the middle of our project.  With him, the whole client-side project team resigned.  The new team decided to do the rest of my work themselves rather than working with an outside contractor.  (That's part of why people hire contractors.  They would do the work themselves, but they lack in-house skills or time.)

The site went live, and I could see hints of my work in what ultimately launched.  The owner of the agency I was working with gave me a solid recommendation.  I'm still, to this day, happy that I worked with them and took on that project.  And it's helped me land other work.

Poor relationship management - if you had major concerns over the way the project was being run then you should have escalated them to the SRO.

Why didn't you bring this up with someone? If it was going to fail in it's current state then surely this would be of utmost importance?

Failure to negotiate or set realistic expectations with stakeholders

>Underfunded and unrealistically timeboxed

Unable to utilize research (product specific or not) to influence design decisions

Having a solid background in research will help you make more informed design decisions such as: what features do these users like/dislike? Our demographic is middle aged folks so the design needs to be simple and legible as opposed to say modern and small font, does our user base prefer to skim or have more details presented to them (short-paragraphs vs long paragraphs), Etc etc...

You don't need to have an artistic bone in your body to learn how to create sketches, wireframes, or mockups. As long as you understand the basics and are able to explain why you put an image here, a title here, or a button there, you're good! Designs ARE formulas!

The caveat though - some companies really do want that super creative designer that creates innovative designs, but not all of them! There are plenty of companies that would welcome someone with your background with open arms because you will make smart decisions over ""I think this looks nice so I'll just stick this there.""

I'd suggest downloading Sketch, it's a very common UX software program, but it's stupidly easy to learn! See if you could replicate some wireframes. I think you're just feeling intimidated, but you shouldn't be at all.

thrillandcreate,"User research positions I see are more likely than other UX specializations to require a master's or even Ph.D.  There is more to user research than knowing how to run a study on UserTesting.  There are quantitative and qualitative sides to user research, and grad students are frequently taught how to do that.  That said, I do user research in my projects without an advanced degree in it.

A UX practitioner doesn't need to have great or even good art skills.  But if you are serious about getting into aspects of UX that involve making the product versus identifying the user needs, you need to become good at some aspect of front-end development, interaction design, information architecture, or visual design.  Fewer of these specialized job roles, like Information Architect, seem to exist today.  But you can get a general understanding of all of them and choose 1-2 to be your strongest points.  

If you're good at the thinking/conceptual side of UX, user research and IA are good places to apply these problem-solving skills while leaving the implementation and visual design to people who are better at them.  (That's why I would rank my UX skills as interaction design first, then IA, then user research.  I don't want to write code anymore, and I'm not an artist.)

Stay where you're at and prove to him that you know what you're doing and you ALL are figuring it out as you go along. You've been good enough to get him where he is now. There's no reason to change.

The other thing as well with a really senior person. I'll be nice to the design team but I'm going to be brutally honest with him.

You being a senior designer, since you are a founding member, makes sense. But, he *is* right that you should have a management level person to lead the team. A good UX manager will help you and the team grow your skills, help guide strategy, make sure the design & development processes scale and continue to work well for your company, deal with budget for your team/department, etc. Those are all things, in all honesty, that you won't have the time to do unless you give up doing the design work. After just finishing school and being this early in your career, I wouldn't recommend giving up doing the design work just yet. 

If you decide to stay at the company, I would talk to your boss about just that. You agree that you need someone with industry experience, but you think it should be in management and processes, etc. With 3 designers at a small start up, you'll have plenty of designers to do the design work.

AFloppyDingus303,"I was in a similar situation to yourself. I was working at a decent corporate gig that paid ok, but was considering going back to school to finish my design degree. I chose instead to take my chances at a small startup. This was by far the best decision of my life. Not because we were fortunate enough to be acquired by a FAANG company (lucky), but because I learned far more working at a startup than I ever learned while pursuing a degree. When a company will literally fail if your team doesn’t step up, it really lights a fire under you that nothing else can. You learn skills that a large company can never teach.  

And the friendships that come out of these experiences are some of the strongest friendships I’ve ever formed. Looking back, I wouldn’t change a thing and am thankful I took the leap. 

Back to your original question: I can tell you that many companies do not care if designers have a masters. Many don’t even care about a bachelors. It really comes down to hard skills and soft skills:

Design talent
Interpersonal skills
Leadership skills
Passion and desire
Presentation skills
A solid portfolio

We look for traits like this when hiring more so than pedigree. 

IMO, you’ll learn far more at a startup then you’ll get from a masters. You may consider finding a solid mentor instead of pursuing a degree. This person could help you learn management and leadership skills.

We then make a copy of that Trello board, saving the first one as the raw data and using the second one as a board where we can manipulate the information. We take our labeled cards and start to group them together into separate columns so that we can begin to see trends.

Frankly, it works fairly well, but there is a fair amount of the manual overhead. I haven't found a much better way to do it yet, other than trying to get involved in spreadsheets. But that seems to be a little less flexible and fluid for trying to identify trends we look for.",1515774187.0

deeprowallez,"Unity is needed if you’re implementing anything. It’s easy enough to learn, has a lot of tutorials available (from their own site or on sites like Lynda.com) and some platforms (like Microsoft’s mixed reality platform) rely on it entirely, no alternatives like Unreal exist. 

Learning about it is going to be an exercise in how you apply your new and existing knowledge to a new area. Adapting best practices and heuristics to a new medium is a challenge, so start taking notes. 

I’m not a full time UX practitioner, nor do I actively develop for VR/AR at the moment. However, I’ve done professional work in both areas in the past. If there’s a standard work on VRUX, I’m unaware of it. 


Step 1: Honestly, start using the devices. They can be pricy, but there are some less expensive headsets available for VR that’ll let you try out a lot of apps and games. Ask around, find a friend who can let you use their Vive for a couple hours. Tell them it’s part of a research project for your program if it helps. 

Step 2: Keep in mind that there’s not just ONE solution to things. Different devices have different goals. Different kinds of apps have different usage needs. Keep that in mind. Not to be trite, but think about it like different personas:

Helen HoloLens wants to walk around 3D spaces with accuracy. She wants experiences that improve on her actual situation, location, and reality, like observing the details on a 3D sculpture, but don’t distract her to the point she trips over the chair on the other side of the room. 

Veronica Vive wants to shut reality out and immerse herself in new experiences. Visuals and audio should help push that immersion, not detract from it. And she wants to be able to stay immersed for more than 20 minutes before her neck feels like it’s going to fall off, so consider device weight and how often you make her look up and down a whole bunch with a heavy headset on. 

AR Analize has an iPhone X, and loves working on her house. She measures her rooms with new AR apps, and the new IKEA app is fantastic, but manipulating 3D objects from a 2D touchscreen is a challenge. 

These users need different tooling for how they interact with their apps/games. They’ll be more or less satisfied with solutions that rely on normal mobile app interfacing vs. some novel form of experience. And if you want a quick lesson in what doesn’t work, try typing in a long password on a HoloLens with the Airtap gesture. Ouch.  

Step 3: Do some user research on your own. Interview people who use particular apps. What works about the new AR+ more in Pokémon Go? What doesn’t? What’s confusing? Can you think of any potential solutions? (Solving issues like these in new platforms often takes a lot of lateral thinking and applying lessons from other media)

Step 4: Share and participate in the community. Find local UX groups, game dev meet ups, etc. Others will have good insights, and can benefit from yours. 

Good luck! And enjoy!

A lot of companies seem to be looking for a unicorn that can do both design and programming at an expert level, but these are usually companies that don't really understand what UX is. The companies worth applying for will know what kind of UX designer they need and will specify it. You do not need to know both equally... hell, you don't even need to know one, you can be purely a UX researcher. The bigger and more experienced the company, the better chance you have of finding a niche role in the UX process. Smaller companies and startups will either want you to know both (ridiculous if you ask me), or will expect you to do every step of the UX process aside from either the final UI design or the programming (depending on your background). 

It all boils down to what your interests are in. Aside from the obvious design/programming background, I know there are UX designers with engineering backgrounds and psychology backgrounds that do just fine in more niche roles. ",1515811955.0

crookedpixel,"Just spitballing here (it's late so forgive me in advance if I'm longwinded and rambling lol).

I would start out by challenging what they feel UX is. Everyone has a preconceived notion of what UX entails; Which is usually just drawing grey boxes and handing it off to the designer. To the more advanced it would include user research and testing. In reality, we are researchers, data analysts, user testers, designers, rapid-prototypers, cognitive scientists, psychologists, ethnographers, the list goes ON!!

I like the concept of comparing two websites but I think you can take it a step further. Show how UX impacts users outside of the obvious digitial touch points. What's it like when they are introduced to the brand? Where were they, facebook, twitter, IG?  What do they do next, go to the website, read an article, read reviews about the product? What happens after they order the product and receive it? What's the journey? Show the full brand ecosystem.

Talk about user journey maps and empathy maps. Make up a case study, create a user persona and their journey, and talk about all the touch points a brand will have and how UX can relieve stress where there are pain and friction. Maybe the website is beautiful but it's hard to check out. Maybe they've received their product but it's hard to get in touch with customer service (I'm looking at you Teavana). Make this person FEEL REAL. You're telling a story.

And remember, don't present… tell a story.

Extra credit, read a bit up on service design if you haven't. Some great case studies out there!

xbraver,"The biggest pain point from a sample size of 1, that scrolling interfaces like this suffer from, is a lack of pace (like a run-on sentence). It places a lot of burden on the user to break up the animation and content into something consumable for them. 

Similar to how written language has mechanisms to mirror pauses and breaks, an interaction equivalent to this would make it much easier to consume.

Although from just a pure content stand point its a lot easier to read than a very dense white paper :)",1515454089.0
legolad,"Congratulations. Remember, anybody who is worth working for will not expect you to know everything, especially since this is your first job. Instead, they will expect you to be honest about what you know and what you don't know. Even more importantly, they will expect you to take the initiative on training. That means:

1. When someone gives you work, always go to them first when there is something you don't know how to do. ""Hey, do we have a standard way of doing this or do you have an example I could see?""
2. When you find yourself needing further training on a skill or technique, start with readily available resources (Youtube or articles) and, if they aren't easy to find, ask your boss if she/he has a good resource for learning that. But GOOGLE FIRST! 
3. Make sure you study your team's guidelines for design and learn them well (if they don't have any, they might appreciate some help building them).
4. Start reading blogs of respected designers and find out who your boss/coworkers follow. These can be great for learning and for bonding with your team. ""Hey did you see the latest post from Jesse James?""

In short, be interested in your field, a self-starter, and have enough humility to ask for help.",1515428275.0

djvortix,"I'm about halfway into the immersive course here in Denver. Our instructor is fantastic and has a heavy background in both UX & Dev work. Unique thing about him too is he's been doing daily Sketch homework and we're about to touch on HTML, CSS and a bit of JS, something not directly taught with the course. Plus he wants us to be able to either have some starting knowledge if some of us are interested in more dev stuff once we finish or at the very least know what GitHub is and the like.

It starts slow but it really depends how much prior design work you know. I came from an IT Desktop Support background and love the idea of UX since I'm actually solving problems and not fixing issues like I was with IT. Difficulty spikes and you'll suck at the tools at first (Sketch alone is fairly daunting but I know most of the hotkeys now), about to start Project 4 and sweating bullets a bit (have to go back to a previous solo project and polish the fuck out of it basically).

I can answer more questions if need be, but I honestly think (this may also be campus specific) but I'm absolutely getting my money's worth with this course. I'm going way outside of the comfort zone in order to do it as well, but its been very rewarding so far.",1515388413.0
,"I have not taken that course, being too far along in my own career by the time these things started popping up, but I hired a girl who had recently completed it and was very pleased with her ability and willingness to continue learning.  She's gone on to do excellent work for serveral other companies.

That said, I've also seen students coming out of these programs without even a basic vocabulary.  My understanding is that the value of these courses is largely determined by what you bring and how much you put in.

For my part I had a generally positive experience taking their front-end development course ~3-4 years ago;  It filled in a lot of gaps and answered a huge number of questions I had attempting to teach myself.  That said, half the class didn't show up.  Many of those who did were seriously underprepared.  One poor guy got hung up on what a boolean was.  He kept saying ""how can something 'equal' false?  it either is, or it isn't!"".  That was a long day.  Others had set their sites so low (e.g., editing wordpress templates) that they just ignored the programming lessons.  So in a class of perhaps 20, only 6-8 of us were really there to do something with the material.  Luckily those 6-8, plus the instructor and TA, were deeply invested.",1515360937.0

icanfly,"Every team charter is different and should be driven by the composition and objectives of the team and business. All teams share the 'make awesome shit' aspect. But the charter is about that statement in detail.

For instance, if you're an app team focused on vacation apps, you'd start with the mission statement: 'help everyone relax, starting with their booking experience' (I'm making this up)

Then something about the driving force of your team: 'reduce the look to book time by making informed design decisions '.

The how: 'leverage our data and research findings to improve with every iteration' (this about your kpi perspectives and business alignment )

And finally about the team itself: 'to retain and develop world class talent through active engagement and cultivation. Blah blah'

Do this as a team by starting with questions and answer them together.

My question(s) would be:

1. Is it possible to start a career in UXD with no prior knowledge or skill relating to such? 

2. How would a marketing/advertising degree help/hurt me?

3. I’m considering going back to school for UXD. Should I go to grad school or get certified instead?

It seems like it could be a perfect fit for me but I’d like a little advice on how to get started on landing a job and being successful in the field. I’m very good with computers but have no formal coding experience. I guess my questions would be as follows;

1.	Is it necessary to have either a degree in comp sci or a masters in UX Design or would informal skills with http, javascript, etc, be enough to land an entry level job? 

2.	There is a UX program at University of Washington that I would definitely be interested in doing but I don’t know much about it. Does anyone have experience with this program or any other programs in the California Bay Area? Is it possible to be accepted without a formal coding or computer science background? Would this masters program be exceedingly helpful in the job search?

serendeepty,"Hi!

I am 26 and currently have been an elementary teacher for four years. I discovered this path recently within the past year, but started to do more research on it and I decided I am going to pursue this career field! I've always been very interested in human behavior, usability, and visual design. I am so excited and scared at the same time because I am finally doing something that I love, but I have no idea where to start.

My first few steps so far:

I bought the book ""Don't Make Me Think"" by Steve Krug and I plan on reading that to familiarize myself with the User Experience field.
I also looked into UX Bootcamps such as Career Foundry & DesignLab, but leaning towards Design Lab.
I am currently watching the ""Become an User Experience Designer"" path videos on LinkedIn Lynda.
What else should I be doing to start myself off in this field? I know that the job market is very saturated with junior designers, but I don't think it's impossible to get a job so I'm staying optimistic. I would like to grab as much advice as I can & fully indulge myself into this new field after my teaching contract ends in June. So I have the summer months to really focus.

lifewonderliving,"Hello everyone, been working in the game's industry (mostly indie, mobile gaming studios) for about 3 years as a Concept Artist. As much as I love working as a Concept Artist/Illustrator I would like to explore opportunities as a UX designer for Tech. 
This is primarily because of the wider industry opportunities there seem to be(at least from the outside) as a UX designer as compared to the Game's Industry. 
As a concept artist I see the talent pool being saturated with way too many over skilled artists not being able to get employment for the sheer reason of their not being enough jobs available. Even though I'm employed at the moment I would like to position myself in an industry that has a bit more breathing space/ demand.
As far as my ""passion"" goes for UX, I'm currently responsible for redesigning the UX of the game we're developing, have had some past experience and find the process of creating smooth, fool proof experiences quite exciting. I tend to enjoy all things design in general so I dont really see an issue sustaining the switch of fields. 
As far as my work ethic, dedication, sincerity go- I tend to fair relatively well. Work around 9-12 hrs including personal work after my full time job.

I would like to know 
1) If there any myths that needs busting, before I go all serious with investing my time in this move. As in a myth surrounding the Game's industry is that its extremely profit making and there seems to be an ever requirement for talent. Quite the opposite, especially for the talent part. The likes of EA, Blizzard, etc make money but even their talent hiring is a very tough nut to crack
2) Should be moving to Canada and am looking at bootcamp academies, the likes of The RED Acamedy, Brainstation to get some relative formal training and networking opportunities. Any recommendations? (avoiding expensive and long course like Carlton's HCI course)

skinz89,"Helppp pleaseee. 

Damn- so when I was in college, majoring in Psych, my professor told us about how Psychology majors could move on to pursuing careers in User Interface or User Experience. Here, I stand, I took a different route and decided to pursue a masters in Behavior Analysis. After working in the field for a few weeks, I decided it’s not for me. (I literally came home every single day with a huge throbbing migraine from the extensive work). 

Anyway, I am wondering how I can use this degree, along with any free/paid experience, to pursue a career in UX? Also, how could I ensure that a career in UX would be for me? What do you do on a day to day? How is your stress level? How hard is it to get into the field?  Do you stress? Do you have to do extensive work? Would you say there is a great work/life balance?

shylake88,"Grad school - Gatech or CMU?

Hey fellow UXers! I just got admitted to Georgia Tech’s MS-HCI program in industrial design track and CMU’s MHCI, now it’s hard decision time!
Anyone who have went through one of the programs or have worked with graduates from them? I would love to hear your opinion! I've searched the Internet for answers but feel like people don't compare these two very often. 

My concerns: 

1. Personal development. Two years at Gatech and become a RA in their labs would allow me to discover more personal “style” and interest, I’ve seen students focus on AR VR for example. CMU seems to be to rushed for that. I plan to work after and not apply for phd. I also would like to work at creative agencies (which Gatech graduates seemed to avoid )
2. Finding a job right after. Two years at Gatech would allow an internship in the middle. (I have next to none work experience)
3. Cost: full tuition fee is both around 70k /80k, but Gatech allows students to work as TA and RA, which would almost cut the tuition fee in half.
4. But, CMU is CMU :I feel like everyone knows CMU is a big name Gatech is not as well known in the industry. (Correct me if I’m wrong!)

minstrelman91,"Hey guys,

TL;DR: Need help finding my next Junior UX Researcher position. I have been hustling and networking a lot. What else should I be doing?

I need some advice looking for my next UX Researcher opportunity. I will break it down as follows: My Work Experience So Far, My Current Situation, and What I Have Been Doing So Far.

My Work Experience So Far:
So I have been in the UX field for about roughly 3 years (it will be 4 by June). My past experience so far has been as follows: started as a UX Architect Intern for a digital marketing firm building wireframes and sitemaps. Then while finishing up my Masters in HCI I was working part-time for a startup on a one year contract serving as a hybrid UX Researcher (survey design, secondary research, personas, and journey mapping) and Chatbot Designer (Conversation Maps and Content Strategy without realizing it at the time). After that, I worked as Contract UX Researcher for startup design agency working on a 3-month contract conducting generative research and synthesis for a client. Once that was over, after about 6 months I worked as Contract UX Researcher for a 3 month contract remote position that involved conducting unmoderated usability testing.

My Current Situation

Now here I am currently on the hunt for my next UX Researcher opportunity and it has been the third month. I have been rejected by three companies so far since January and it has been a real test of my patience. Responses I get are usually along the lines of while we were impressed and showed great promise, we wanted someone who is more senior. It has been a bit of a conundrum with the whole to get an experience you need experience.

What I Have Been Doing So Far

So here is what I have been doing so far:

i. Strengthening My Skills Through Side Projects - I have been working on strengthening my skills on quantitative UX Research by brushing up on my statistics and research methods I learned from my undergrad and masters years as well as what I learned from my previous job. I am doing so by reading Quantifying The User Experience by Jeff Sauro, brushing up and strengthening my skills in R, Python, and Excel, and Google Analytics Certificate. In addition, I have been doing more practice with conducting usability testing guerilla style with this side project. Ultimately, my goal is to not only add this project as a portfolio piece but also publish it on Medium as well.

ii. Medium Articles - I have published two Medium articles so far that have been well received. However, I am hoping to step up my game even more.

iii. Networking - In addition to building and strengthening my skills, I have been actively networking and building connections. So before applying for positions, I reach out to people via LinkedIn and ask them about the opportunities and let them know I am interested. In addition, I head the UX Book Club under my UXPA Chapter and people really enjoy these events and the board members of my UXPA Chapter really love how dedicated I am. I am also part of the OpenIDEO Chapter and am working on another side project through it.

The point is I am really, really trying, but I am still having trouble landing my next job. Not to brag, but on my LinkedIn I have gotten 9 recommendations from all the people I have worked under. Besides the typical advice of this is a numbers game, is there anything else I should do to make myself more competitive and stand out? I don't understand what's wrong with me.

I would really appreciate any advice on how I should move forward. Thank You!",1520533494.0

Trying to decide if a Masters is right for me. I have a B.S. in Computer Science and have about 7 years of industry experience in Software Development and Consulting. 

I'm looking to make the transition into UX but I'm unsure if doing a Masters is the right option. I've considered both a bootcamp as well as a certificate (UCLA, UCSD, Cal State) and while I agree with the sentiment that these programs aren't necessarily the perfect solution, I'm looking at them as less of a ""credential"" and more as a rigid program to get me experience and build a portfolio.

I understand that a Masters is probably the best option and provides the best opportunities moving forward, but I struggle with putting myself in 40-80k of debt (my wife and I are almost finished paying off our original student loans) and uprooting my life to move somewhere for a year or two.

,"I'll try to be succinct and not look like I'm begging for pity.

I wasted my life. I am 25, did not go to college, and between high school and a year ago I played video games and watched YouTube and did nothing else. I have a year of job experience now with two factories and loading trucks for FedEx. I live in the middle of nowhere (south of Murfreesboro, Tennessee) with my parents, neither of which have an education or work. I cannot afford a car, so I use theirs, and they don't want me me to commute out of the city for work. I have about $3000 now. (medical bills)

But... since August, I have read over 20 general UX design books, hundreds of blog articles, 3 Udemy courses (3 more in the future), 12 Lynda courses, and DesignLab's Design 101 course (User Research course coming up). I write detective fiction and I draw. I've done those for years. I have sketched wireframes, site designs, and dabbled in everything I could to make up for my shameful past—IA, UI, even critical thinking (for biases, fallacies, and so on).

I want to work in something related to travel or tourism (mainly because I've studied Japanese for 8 years and I want to localize sites for UX purposes). I like user research; is that in-demand? And yes, I will move out of this town. There's nothing here. But my parents won't let me move until I have a job lined up.

Is this impossible? How hard is it? I'm willing to work my butt off. (No, really. I read UX stuff four hours a day.) I have ideas for projects like a fake big hotel site, but I don't know what to do beyond the UI.

Sonnet_in_December,"Few questions as someone thinking of committing two years to studying a Masters in User Experience


**Q1. Do many companies distinguish a UX Designer/Architect from a graphic/web designer?**

I am interested in information architecture, wire framing and coding, less interested in having to worry about colours and fonts. Not keen to have to interview users and collect data, but happy to analyze the results and prototype potential solutions.


**Q2. How much opportunity is there to work on the usability of other products, not just web/phone apps**

I would love to be some sort of usability consultant at a place like IDEO, where I can work with clients to improve their service or products. Is this a pretty steep and niche aspiration?


**Q3. Any advice on before I embark on my journey?**

My plan for this year is to bolster my coding skills, and get a better understanding of UX through books and whatever I can consume. I'm currently reading Don Norman's The Design of Everyday things.

Next year I'm hoping to take a Masters in UX, which will give me a chance to build a portfolio and apply for internships.

MercuryRyan,"Hi, I'm currently a student studying information technology (Not Degree). I've recently found a passion for UX Design (Not research) because of a module in school from the previous semester and have spent the past few days looking for local college courses that were intriguing or similar to the field.

I have come to the conclusion that I would like to do something more related to design and hence would want to pursue something like Communication Design studies or Design studies in general specialising in graphic design. However, many of these courses require a portfolio with several original works (probably showcasing a certain level of skill). I would love to build my portfolio, but I only have a year left before I need to apply and I am unsure of where to start or how to start.

I understand that I need to have several projects in my portfolio, however, as of now, I currently have a case study project of a revamped restaurant website and nothing else. I am unsure of how to continue my self-studies in User Experience as there is an overload of information across the web. I wanted to start by diving into some case study projects or volunteer for free projects for start ups or non-profit organisations, however even if I knew where to find some of these projects, I do not understand how I should even start designing and delivering real world projects to real clients.

As of now, I only know how to use the marvel app (for phone prototyping) and adobe XD for website design.

Edit: That said, I do have access to the entire adobe CC Suite and am willing to learn whichever tools necessary to fill my portfolio with projects. Also, I've considered attending GA's online UX Boot camp for 6 weeks or other boot camps that can be done during my free time with my current 9 to 5 internship (Non-UX Related) for the next 6 months. Also, one example of the colleges and courses I'm interested in would be this one: https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/undergraduate-programmes/communication-design

UX_123,"Trying to change my career for the better:

I currently hold an Associate's degree but do not have a Bachelor's. I find that not having a Bachelor's has held me back from climbing the corporate ladder and from being considered for other jobs. My current job is pretty soul sucking and I'd ready to change that. I'm interested to hear from those already in the field how I, someone without a UX background, can break into the industry. I plan to look at free or cheap courses on Udemy to get my feet wet. The local community colleges around here don't offer any UX courses, so I plan on finding a college that offers an online degree for psychology.

**Why psychology?**

I've read many UX Designers come from all sorts of backgrounds, so I was thinking about pursuing a bachelor's in psychology from an online college because 1) psychology interests me 2) figured it would help with user research/set me apart and 3) there aren't many affordable online colleges that offer UX Design as a degree. Seriously, $500/per credit?! The two schools that I've looked at so far are Oregon State University Online and SNHU Online. On the OSU website, it says they don't charge online students out of state tuition which is nice.

Because I still plan to work F/T, and don't want to take out unnecessary loans, my plan is to take 2 classes each semester until I finish. My company doesn't offer tuition reimbursement. Not that it matters because I'm trying to move on.

Is this a step in the right direction? Or counter intuitive? I have some reservations because I'm not sure a company will look at someone with a degree in psych and think to hire them as part of the UX Design team. Maybe I'm naive or wrong but I'd love to hear your opinions, thanks!

edward-porter,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for advice and tips on tackling take-home design challenges and the on-site review. I made it onto the third stage of the interview process for a company, in which they gave me a take home and will schedule the onsite upon receipt. 


The challenge was pretty straightforward: add a repeating event option to the company's event scheduling flow. They only asked for wireframes. I knew they were apprehensive about my junior status and I really need a job so I went the extra mile and went into high-fidelity in Sketch and even threw it into a prototype. I documented my process, included pictures of wireframes, research studies that I referenced, went through the details of my decision making, linked everything in a Dropbox Paper doc and sent it back. They didn't reply for several days which worried me. I sent an email to make sure they received it, but they replied and wrote me off without even bringing me in. 

Can someone explain to me what just happened here? The challenge dealt with their existing product and they actually didn't have the repeating event feature but I don't even want to get into that scenario - Was I missing something in my take home that rubbed them the wrong way? What are people actually looking for in this stage of interviews? The only thing I could think of that I didn't do was not have multiple solutions - because I already reasoned those out based off design research and logic.

Fortunately, I'm about to head into another take home with a different company, but now I'm questioning my own skills. I'd really appreciate any pointers on this take-home challenge step, I don't know what I missed in my previous take home that didn't even warrant me an on-site attempt, but I'm running out of resources to stay in SF so I really want to prepare well for the one coming up.

I'm pretty new to User Experience and I'm trying to understand if I really want to work in it, and if so, in which field I would fit best.

This is something I made recently, which made me realize that I still have to learn A LOT and has huge flaws, but I think it's a good example to understand what I like to do, and so understand better my question:

https://vimeo.com/258935559

All the screens and transitions were made from scratch using Sketch (except some icons and photos obviously). 

Making that is something I really enjoyed and I enjoy even more doing things like that when it's related to mobile interfaces/mobile OS (I spent quite a few hours when I was a kid messing up with Android launchers and photoshop to change how my phone looked like and how everything was displayed. I like more the ""designing"" part rather than the ""user research"" part. 

In my dream job I would do these tasks (in order of preference):

1.	Design High fidelity mockups and give them life with animations 
2.	Design Wireframes to know how to structure everything 
3.	Program the whole interface 
4.	User Research and understanding how the user feels 

I also come from a CS background (graduating next year).

What I want with this question is to know if with my profile I would fit in UX (if so in which field) or It will be better to focus on the development side (in case I choose ux I will study a master in HCI)

**TL;DR:

I really like to design high and low fidelity mockups, and I also like the development part of mobile applications but I’m not sure if I would like to focus on understanding how the user feels, making interviews, testing... So I don’t know if I would fit in UX or if it will be better to focus on the development part which is something I also like

As your team is rather small, I'm assuming this is actually more a 'UX Lead' rather than a manager position.

Every organisation is different, but here's some things to think about as you begin your role:

* What are the UX needs of the organisation?
* What are the strategic needs of the organisation?
* What do you need to understand before you feel like you can make informed decisions about the future of UX for the organisation?
* How can you effectively create a UX workplan or roadmap which details what you are going to achieve in the next 6-12 months?
* How established is UX within the organisation? Do you need to create a set of UX principles? Do they exist already?
* Who do you need to develop good working relationships with? Are there any business units that are critical to the success of your UX team?
* I assume since you're senior you have some experience with having direct reports, but if you don't, you need to learn some foundational skills about working as a leader - there is a ton of resources around for this.

Jimeee,"It would have been good to have these colleagues and stakeholders onboard during the design phase so that these ideas could have been implemented and tested earlier, but what's done is done.

My gut says if you *really* want validate if these additions actually add value to the end user and aren't just cool features, then you need to do more user research. 

A user might not explicitly say ""I want a way to review my journey"". They might say something that implies it however. And even if they did say it explicitly - its not what they say, its the meaning behind their statement. **Why** do they ""want a way to review their journey"" and is there an alternative that you can design that better serves them? (there might not be).

Its hard to gauge the overall impact a tweak like a ""review your journey"" vs. the time it will take to design, implement and test. 

If I was you, I'd design and prototype the ones that have a rock solid rational behind them, but only after some research interviews.

Additionally I assume you have some idea of a pipeline. Where do you want the product to go? What do you want it to do later down the line?

[Divide the Dollar](http://practicaluxmethods.com/product/divide-the-dollar/), for example. I find it's also handy to think in terms of competitors: is this a feature that pretty much every other similar app has, so that users expect it?

If you're working with product people, its up to you guys to then measure up those problems and prioritize against your product roadmap.

TW_TacoLady,"Self Taught here!

I started here: https://hackdesign.org/lessons
This website has articles that cover (just about) every aspect of UX. Helped me get a better idea of what all I would be doing. Then after that I started designing my own products. First I tried redesigning a product I liked, adding improvements and spent time figuring out why they did what they did. This is a good way to test if you like doing it.

Bootcamps are great if you're willing to spend the money. Not only will you get a teacher, most places (like General Assembly) will leave you with some portfolio pieces. And of course deciding if you want to continue.

 I find that if you can get yourself to complete a project on your own without having someone to tell you to do it is a good test if you're going to like it. So that's why I recommend trying to create something on your own. Even if it's not a great design, you can improve if you like it.

Plyphon,"Great stuff, congratulations. Solid strategy too.

In future, you might consider doing a lean business model canvas beforehand to see if your business 'works' before doing any work, that way if you need to figure out a revenue model you can link it your value proposition before doing any design or code. It's just a tool, but a handy one to consider when starting a new business. 

That's the only thing I didn't see in your article - how you make money. Apologies if I missed it, I did skim read fairly quickly.

Another thing you might consider is completing a value proposition canvas, which helps you link your customers (personas) to a value creation, which then gives you your content strategy. The idea is you link up gain creators and pain relievers to your users pains and gains, thus creating value. You then design your content to meet this value proposition.

Again, it's just a tool, but quite a handy one that allows you to focus on the content that will really deliver your value prop to your customers.

In short: find/build as many ""templates"" as you can for creating a portfolio that demonstrates your skills for writing things like empty states, error messages, onboarding, etc. Doing this for several specific use cases (defined by you) is essential. Get familiar with using tools like Sketch or similar for mocking up different content elements using things like free templates others have uploaded (usually requires attribution, but that's fine) or creating your own if you're up to the task. Learning these UX tools can only help your career anyways. Post your work online, create a blog with examples and the use cases you created, talk about the challenges you faced when creating the mockups, etc. 

Empathy, clarity, and context are three things you want to focus on. These are critical, especially if you're working on a SaaS ""freemium"" app. The Spotify and Vimeo UX writing teams have recently written some fantastic blog posts on these topics as well, so you should check those out. 

There are a couple of Slack groups with hundreds of knowledgeable members who can answer questions for you. Write the Docs is a good one, though more geared toward technical/API writing these days. [Content + UX](http://mjmetts.com/content-ux-slack/) is excellent and probably more of what you're looking for, you just need to submit a short application to the admin for access to it.

What I've always looked for is:

- general design / user-centric thinking (i.e. an appreciation for design beyond writing, and an ability to wrap your head around complex problems)
- a level of fluency with digital interfaces in general
- meticulous English
- a fascination with the mechanics of language and semantics
- good people skills, and 
- clever, detailed responses to problems set in UX writing tests.

Some thoughts from my map design experience:

Let the data you need to display inform the best method of communicating single-point data (location of cell tower for instance) uses icon vs. color for instance. 

Leverage layering and grouping of data. Consider how the user will approach the data (what each persona is looking for) and let that inform your decision making.

Graduated with a BA Hons 1st Class in Graphic Design, already hated graphic design by the time I left university - knew I didn't want to do it for a career. 

Luckily as part of my degree we did some 'web design' (this was a few years ago when the terms 'UI design' wasn't around. This got me a job doing the web marketing/design materials for a small company. This gave me good experience designing for web for real life.

Then managed to score a really good role as a junior 'Visual Designer'  at a large organisation that was developing it's first mobile apps. I was a UI-only designer at this point but we all sat together with the larger UX team and thats where I got my first exposure to UX and found my first UX mentors. Great team that was.

Then 2ish years later I got a internal transfer to a middle weight UX role, and now I'm building personas, designing prototypes and developing usability tests all day. Woo.

And I'm still doing UI, which I kind of enjoy as long as we've done the UX work prior correctly (It's a never ending battle) ",1514904644.0
larik47,"I was working diligently as a content management grunt when I was bought (salary internally ""purchased"") by a veteran project manager to do Business Analysis and user-focused process mapping for a major digital transformation project. This is when UX wasn't really all that well known, and any kind of contextual analysis was considered a novel idea.

By and large, I'm uneducated swine, so instead of having a degree, I gathered enough experience doing this that when I desired more variety and challenge, I was able to get a job as a UX consultant at a digital agency and rose through the ranks there, working on projects for some of the world's biggest banks. I went client-side for a few years to experience that perspective (as lead UX) before going to work for a tech company as Head of UX, shaping business strategy and usability policy. I've since had the pleasure to employ and work with some of the brightest people I've met, but also coexist with some of the most misguided, shortsighted individuals too. There's always a balance. I've spoken publicly on the subject of digital usability and have had my insights and research published.

More recently, we sold the tech company, and I've decided to move out of UX and have joined the board of a different technology startup with more of a commercial focus. 

I still strongly advocate the presence of UX/CX both at board level and throughout an organisation, but have yet to see the former done well. Personally, I've become a bit cynical about the way UX is represented and expected to interact with other departments. I hope UX will persist as a discipline but if I were to gamble on it, I think it is more likely that the function will be subsumed into digital/marketing departments where the incentivisation and approach aren't really compatible with UX philosophy.

Depaysant,"I studied political science at university, graduated, had a hard time getting a job (under qualified for relevant research positions) and a hard time getting into a research masters programme (only a 2:1 with no useful/relevant work experience). Most of my time was spent stressing over LSAT and trying to go into law school in the US. This was only six months ago.

In some moment of frustration during one long sleepness night, I thought, hey, why doesn't anyone write a video game that makes political theory easier to digest. This was an idea that I was already toying with when I was in my final year in uni, but I always saw it as something I would do many more years later, after masters or something. But that night, I just sort of thought, eh, fk it. As I was planning out the work process and project plan for the game, it occurred to me that UX was probably going to be quite important. I found that General Assembly had  UXDI course in my area, so I flip flopped between that and their Data Science Immersive, which felt like it would be far more useful in my academic career, but went with UX instead because I was quite shit at statistics.

Never looked back. I'm still new to the UX field, but I'm having a ball of a time. I already enjoyed thinking about things and general problem solving, so on that level it wasn't super far removed from what I used to do (find problem, solve problem).

karlosvonawesome,"Was originally a Graphic designer kicking around the industry about 12 years, started out in print and did everything from product photography to product design and illustration (physical products, not digital)

Decided to have a career change to be a developer, study development for a year, get job as a front end developer, hated it so went for a UX generalist role and basically got my foot in the door as I could set up A/B tests myself due to having some coding knowledge

Has been interesting as I entered as a UX generalist doing UX/UI, A/B testing and user testing on a team of about 10 designers.

I then moved on to a UX specialist role in another company, where they gave me proper training in design thinking and UX. I would say this is where I worked with people who were more world class and learned a lot from the people around me by having more exposure to exec levels and specialised disciplines such as UX researchers, BAs and POs. I would say the team was about 20 designers.

And now I'm back to generalist in a very quant heavy, A/B testing focused tech company, working on a design ""team"" of over 200 people.

I found moving up to larger companies a very humbling experience as you realise how you can end up jumping into a bigger pond with much bigger fish, the problems are bigger but your scope gets narrower but it opens up much more opportunity.

I would say that the trend I am seeing in the industry is a shift away from UX vs UI specialisation and a focus more on end to end product design and design systems. User research lines are blurring more with UX and the role of a researcher seems to be becoming more strategic and product level than simply running usability tests which is taken up more my UX designers.",1514931958.0
,"I always worked in offices/customer service. I was answering the same question over and over for example ""how do I register?"" I would walk people through the website over the phone. I was confused why the website was so complicated and why smart people were getting upset/angry when they couldnt do the simplest task. So, I was helping my job by registering them and also soothing and helping people register and become a part of my alma mater. I was really good at that- building a relationship with people who were emotional (I also volunteered with homeless youth/crisis hotlines and that taught me how to listen and help find action together with my callers) and showing them how to accomplish the thing they needed to get done. Then, I was looking at grad school and didn't like my options - I didn't want an MBA and didn't think another art degree would get me what I wanted.

Plyphon,"On the web, V3 is the most resilient design. There is much better contrast vs having the labels inside the boxes which will aid those with less-abled sight, it also works well with how people scan labels and fields (Title, box).

Who are your users? If they're 35 and up, having a site that is better for those with less abled sight would be good design. If you're aiming only at 25s and under, it's (perhaps) not such a consideration. (Though I personally always advocate for inclusive and accessible design.)

Ideally, you'd replicate this on mobile. I would shrink those logos at the bottom and give more space to the core value proposition of your product. (Select a date, get a tour)

From a UI point of view, that call to action button probably doesn't need to be so big on mobile. It's better to be bigger than smaller, but at that size it upsets the interaction hierarchy - users might not see the date and participants field and go straight for that nice big shiny button thats right in the middle ;)

On a final note - that 'view all' at the bottom on mobile is probably too small to tap accurately and the colour contrast is not high enough - of course, test it and don't go by my assumptions, but I'd wager users will miss this 10 times out of 10, and people with less-abled sight might as well give up ever trying to find that button :)

Ezili,"> Would it be worth it for me to hire a UX professional to help me?

I take it your alternative is to do it yourself?

Have you experience doing this type of work yourself? Have you estimated how much time you think it will take you?

Have you a sense of whether you expect a marked improvement in quality if you hire a professional rather than doing it yourself? Have you a sense of what taking on this work will prevent you from doing instead? 

This sound like a matter of trading off time, money and quality. I don't think there are enough details in your post for us to be able to make those decisions, but I think those are some of the relevant question. I also don't really have a clear sense of how you're building your business and whether UX testing is you current limiting issue, or whether you should be spending more attention on the actual business model/market/demand, rather than on usability testing at this stage. 

My estimation is that most people starting out a business focus too much on their product, and not enough on their market. So I'd encourage you to think about whether there is a proven demand and market for what you're making, before you spend too much time refining your product. I may be reading too much between the lines, but you mentioned ""somebody who knows how to start a new business"" which makes me think that is probably the place to spend your attention right now until you are confident you know how you are going to build a business. Make sure you understand the market, and the problem you are solving, before you spend too much time improving your solution. ",1514864820.0

Relocationinginng,"I'll try answering your questions:


Random questions:

1) What sort of forms are they? If they are regarding the website design then it depends whether there has been any changes since. If it is at all to do with the user demograph/base..absolutely. I cant imagine that awareness has increased substantially enough in the last 2 years and the demographic certainly wouldn't have changed much. 

2) Hard to answer this however your surveys will be missing those who are bouncing/ put off so face to face = more data.

3) One that comes to mind is your audience. If the users on the site are older, accessibility will become core (it should be anyway) to your site. The content of your site is also important since you are asking for donations. Copywriting is a largely ignored part of UX. 

Survey Q's: 

1) As short as possible (but seriously, start by understanding what the absolute minimum data points you require) are you asking quant questions or more open-ended questions? The users attention depends on these. see: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/open-ended-questions/?lm=qualitative-surveys&pt=article

2) Can be as low as 30 but realistically you should aim for around 200 responses.

3) googling ""nngroup survey"" good place to start.

Plyphon,"Some random tips from my experience doing this quite a bit:

Prepare and prepare again - have a well defined agendas with times and stick that on the whiteboard for people to read when they come in. Time things on your phone and KEEP to time! If something over runs, either get everyones approval to extend the meeting or make a call on cutting a later exercise or the current one short.

Know your tools - whatever exercises you're doing, know them well and know how to fill them in. Keep the book/website/whatever handy to refer to when you get brainfreeze. 

Get your attendees to do the work - you're facilitating, not participating. That means you need to prompt and add areas of thought and commentary, but the answers have to come from your attendees. This is hard, as UX people tend to try and participate in these.

Don't waffle - your attendees have taken time out of their busy schedule, respect their time. Keep introductions and bits of talking short and sweet. Encourage them to ask questions, rather than you reading out every detail of every tool. 

Ice break, but not cheesy - Get people thinking with a quick 5 minute ice breaker. If i'm doing a session where people will draw, I like using 'Squiggle Birds' as it gets people into the mood of sketching. If it's a strategy workshop or similar, 'Design your favourite wallet' or similar can work. There are many out there  (Google those or check Gamestorming). Avoid anything cheesy, keep it so it has some practical element or strategic lesson.

Get your materials - post its, blue tac, sharpies, dry wipes, whatever. Get them, and get loads of them! Nothing more frustrating than having to take the lids of off 5 dry wipes to find all of them died 6 months ago. Get a giant flip board too if possible. Print outs, etc

Be prepared to direct conversation - some people, especially hippos, will try and rail road decisions and conversations. Be prepared to step in firmly but politely and professionally to direct the workshop. If people get into aimless talk, encourage them to capture what they're saying on post-it notes. Encourage people to refer their thoughts to the tools you're using at the time. ""I see there is a lot of passion behind this, but I feel it's taking us off agenda here - let's get back to the tool we're trying to complete and capture some of these thoughts, please"".

If someone says something you don't understand, ASK WHY! - Chances are if you didn't understand something, then someone else didn't understand it either. Ask for clarification. Say 'Sorry but I don't understand, can you explain?' You need to understand everything.

If someone says something stupid/bullshit/nonsense - ASK WHY! - Often you'll get people using confusing or abstract language. Ask them to clarify their thoughts - two things will happen, either they'll use simpler language and will actually have an interesting thought, or they'll realise you've called them out on their BS and say 'Actually, never mind.'. 

A great book with lots of collaborative exercises is 'Value Proposition Design' by Strategyzer. I use these tools almost daily. It's more of a lean 'product design' book rather than UX, but the tools have lots of UX elements/tools/practices in them (user research, personas, ideation, etc) and the rest of the stuff encourages strategic thinking which is where you as a UXer need to be.

Any more thoughts... I'll update this.

Good luck!

Especially, when combined with accurate 'useful defaults' if we're guessing right on some of the fields for them they may scan past the placeholder text. I don't use it anymore. Contextual help is more fitting when there needs to be explanatory text.",1514650167.0
Plyphon,"If you have a resilient design a lot of edge cases can be put together using patterns you've already designed. That just comes with experience, I'm afraid.

That's part of what 'atomic design' and design systems etc try to predict/solve. If you've got a set pattern for every interaction then you can put things together without needing an explicit UI design.

So when I deliver to devs, I usually design screens for key interactions, then deliver a style guide or similar with all patterns, spacing/paddings, colours, etc so devs can put things together without a design. I hand off via InVision right now. 

As I sit next to my devs, they put something together and ask for a sign off, I walk round and 99% of the time it's 'Yup, good job!' and only occasionally we need to design a whole new interaction or screen. 


EDIT: I'm not sure if it's assumed, but wireframes are a separate deliverable from UI in my workflow. Devs always work from wireframes, but not always from delivered UI designs. Hope that makes sense.",1514897613.0
bitesizepanda,"Check out the book “User Experience Team of One” by Leah Buley. I just picked up a copy myself as I’ll be the sole UX person on a newly formed team. In university I worked UX for a semester on our Uni app so I have a bit of experience with it all. The main problem you may face is getting buy-in. Your ux strategy is at it’s most useful when you’re heavily involved in every step of the process, but as an intern and the first UX designer you may have trouble getting a place at the table. Some critical functions of UX slow down the process, like conducting research and testing prototypes before coding the final product. These processes are vital but you may need to fight for this time.

Everyone has imposter syndrome, don’t let it get you down. Exuding confidence can get you the ethos you need to win respect for bringing UX into the uni projects.

DCTapeworm,"Hi Forceful,

I'm a UX Manager who brings in an intern every year to work on projects we have.  For your situation, I'd recommend the following:

1.  Depending on how you're onboarded to the team, you'll want to seek some clarity from the folks you'll be answering to (the team or your boss).  What are their expectations of you?  What would they like to see?

2.  Come to the table with a list of things you want to get out the internship.  It's not a one-way street in that regard.  If you were to envision yourself 3-6-12 months into the internship, what do you want to learn/experience?

3.  If you do have a specific person you report to during your internship, set up some 3 month goals that both of you can agree on.  Also, bridge the subject of impact.  What can you do that would have a tremendous impact for everyone concerned?

That's a good starting list.  It's never as bad you think it's going to be.  If you have any follow-up questions, just post here or PM me.

,"Much of the criticism is valid and well argued: the obfuscation of improvement, the seemingly arbitrary adjustment for scoring of what is presented to the user as a linear scale, asking responders to predict the future...

There’s a few bits that get iffy, though: when the author suggests taking the mean response value from a Likert-like scale, and later on blasts Likert-like scales in general.  While such criticisms are not invalid, they feel short-sighted and incomplete.

[This is a great article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4833473/) that gives some high-level discussion of how Likert scales can work (or not work) in contemporary contexts.

The most important point, from my perspective, is that reducing a range of responses to a singular value paints an incomplete picture.  Distributions are easily shared and visualized, and allow the analyst to make his own decisions about what they mean.

The second point, which the original author touches on, is that change over time is more important than an individual moment, especially when the goal is growth.  Responses rising from lower on the scale may not mean profit, but they can mean stemming losses.  Responses falling from higher can likewise indicate flagging interest.  So if you’re going to allow highly granular responses, it’s important to preserve them.",1514485172.0

I've seen billion-dollar companies where senior developers went barefoot.  I've seen pre-funding startups where pro-bono devs wore slacks and jackets.

In the case of interviewing for a UX position, the interviewer is your 'user' and you are your 'product', so showing that you've researched their specific hopes and expectations is a subtle hint that you take them seriously.

If you don't have a contact at the company, look at their websites or social media for images of employees.  If all else fails, ask the people that are interviewing you.

HugTheRetard,"UX takes into account a wide spectrum of disciplines, including design. Designing for humans is of utmost importance. Courses in psychology will help you to understand human behavior, a course in research methods will help you to form studies to gather information and observe behavior, but it sounds like you may have that under your belt already if you come from a marketing background.

Get some design tools and start using them. For creating interface designs, I prefer Sketch and Axure. Both have great design tools and they each have the ability to creating prototypes, Axure being on the more robust end of the spectrum. 

Go through an exercise of redesigning a current website. First, talk to some people or observe their behavior when using the website. Second, think about your user needs, goals, and frustrations. Think about how you will address these and sketch out some ideas. Read up on usability trends, or create something new. 

Learn about technical abilities and limitations with the technology you are designing for. 

Read some case studies to help familiarize yourself with the process. You'll probably be doing all of the above if you enroll in a UX 101 course. Good luck!",1514388384.0

sockmonkeyrevolt,"Oddly I’m going through this process myself, it’s odd because I’ve been designing for 11 years, but don’t have a portfolio yet, primarily because I design voice interaction and always thought of portfolios as a visual medium, so I’ve been researching how to build one when I don’t have pretty end product graphic screen shots. 

From the advice I’ve gotten and research I’ve done, what prospective employers will be looking for most in a UX portfolio will be your design process and decision making justifications. Ideally you would take a few projects from project objective through deployment and layout how you went about each phase of the UX process with examples of how you researched the users, sketched and narrowed down potential designs, validated assumptions and how the project turned out.  Essentially a white paper, but with more detail into the whys and the thinking that went into making design choices you proposed, so that they can get a sense of how you approach design challenges to drive the objectives of a client’s project.  You’d want to include examples of design artefacts like personas, sketches, wire frames, research plans, interaction flows, comps, testing methods and yes, screenshots of a final product (if possible). Best case would be stats to show where the design improved kpis, but you probably won’t have those until you have professional experience. 

Real world work is of course better, if nothing else because the design constraints once dealing with actual corporate stakeholders are way more frustrating and binding than any vanity exercise or school project, but because you’re showing a process here projects done for course work should work better than they might in some other segments. If you’ve done the research, you’ve done the research (that part remains similar regardless, unlike the getting the client stakeholders to all sign off on design, copy and colour choices, which no amount of pretending can truly mimic the nail-biting 5th revision prayers). 

The usual advice stands about looking for non-profits to do some pro-bono work in exchange for documenting in portfolio permission (it’s always nice to get clearance for logo work rather than having to blur out or change) stands if you don’t feel like you’ve got enough course work examples or you’re just looking to get more client based examples. 

Somewhere I bookmarked a really good example of someone’s white paper approach to writing up projects for their portfolio; if I can find where I bookmarked it (it wasn’t in the spot I usually save links) I’ll come back and post it in this thread. 

Good luck! This whole process is painfully intimidating to me. I think it’s because while I have no problem talking about or defending my design decisions, I hate talking about myself like a sales pitch, and usually I focus on all the things I could have done better or improved upon in hindsight (that makes me a great UX advocate, but not such a great self-promoter :)  ).

Invision is launching a cross-platform competitor app called Studio very soon, based on the app Macaw which they acquired a couple of years ago.

pixelwench,"A good UX portfolio is not the picture, it’s the frame. Splashy, flashy layouts are great if your intended user is another designer looking up the latest posts on Dribbble. If your intended user is a business stakeholder, a hiring manager or a client who isn’t very invested in the latest design trends then you want something tasteful yet straightforward.

The portfolio you linked is a glaring example of the [Dribbblisation of design](https://medium.com/intercom-inside/the-dribbblisation-of-design-406422ccb026) as far as UX portfolios are concerned.

I’ll preface my criticism of Melanie Daveid's portfolio by saying she is clearly an extremely talented graphic designer. I’d hire her in a heartbeat to illustrate an article but I would pass her over if she were applying for a UX position. The website shifts your focus to the animated illustrations at the expense of her actual UX work. 

Most of the shots from her projects are tilted at trendy angles so it’s hard to judge the quality of the UI work. She doesn’t describe the business problem she’s solving, she doesn’t provide any user personas/archetypes, and she doesn’t show the results of any analysis or usability testing. All I see are angled wireframes and small samples of screens. Also, the buzz-word to actual meaning ratio in her text is way off:

> This appearance was structured into modules with a limited amount of additional functionalities and supportive tools which build the framework for an engaging experience.

I genuinely cannot tell if this is original copy or something generated by Startup Ipsum. 

**TL;DR** - Quirky illustrations, loud colors and daring typography belong in graphic design portfolios. UX portfolios should let your case studies do the talking. When in doubt, do it like [this guy](http://simonpan.com/) does.  ",1513911591.0

ex-oh,"it's tough. I think the issue you're speaking of and the whole matter of UX folks having portfolios in general is just a matter of HR expectations. (the running joke is that an HR person who thought UX was UI asked an applicant for their design portfolio, and the UX person, eager to please, made a portfolio... then it become an expectation)

I also think the lowest common denominator set of UX artifacts that  people know about is a small group of things. 

For my first portfolio our of an MFA, I panned it as the story of my journey into and through design. I started with industrial design, making pretty sculptural things[show a little process from a project here], but then I learned how to assess usability with heuristic evaluation [insert project here], etc etc. Went over well at academic review, but I don't think employers ""got it"" because they were looking for the cookie cutter. One guy got it and hired me, but he was pretty unorthodox himself. 

I've had to move away from the ""journey"" sotry telling trope because in my time in the field, I've done little more than stagnate. I've been struggling to put something together. At this point I've resorted to just showing isolated artifacts (""here are hand drawn wireframes, the context was this"") and some really condensed walk throughs of larger projects that I led.. (""the context was this, to solve the problem we did these, my role was this"") I don't know that it's working. I'm finding that in the geography that I'm at atm, wireframe monkeys are all that's wanted, and by showing more, I'm eliminating myself.. but who knows.

pixelwench,"> I saw a post where someone got 85 applications for a Jr UX position!

That number in and of itself shouldn't make you panic. In my experience, junior positions in most fields get at least 85 applicants. Fresh graduates and anyone browsing /r/jobs are typically advised to shotgun their resumes to all available positions. If the average job-seeker sets a goal of applying to 5-10 jobs per week then most junior positions are going to be absolutely bombarded by applications.

> Since then I've gone back to school, initially for programming but now liberal arts into who-knows-what for a BS, and then I was going to self-learn or bootcamp UX since there are no official programs around here.

""Who knows what for a BS"" and then a bootcamp is a fast-track to becoming one of the under-prepared junior UX designers who have trouble getting their first job. If your school doesn't have an HCI program, why not major in a related discipline? If you originally went to school for programming then getting a CS degree is a great way to have a broad variety of career options in the technical world. Majoring in cognitive psychology and minoring in CS could also be a good option.

Forgive me if I'm making an assumption here, but how much thought have you given to what kind of work you want to do? If you loved working with developers and managers to meet user needs then yes, UX sounds like a good field for you. But the fact that you originally went to school for programming, then changed to liberal arts, and then settled on an unspecified bachelor's degree program makes me think you're not really sure what you want to do. There's nothing wrong with some career uncertainty but I would advise against getting a degree without knowing how you intend to use it. Getting a bachelor's in some random field hoping for the best was a decent career strategy in 1977 but has proved disastrous for many young people in 2017. ",1513873423.0
iamadsgnr,"Don't give up. Schools like Kent State University offer online Masters in UX and if you have experience you could probably get in. Furthermore, as the industry gets more popular- fakers are more easily screened out. That being said, there is an anxiety in the industry about ""Design Thinking"" being way too commercialized. A lot of Graphic Design programs encourage their students to apply for UX positions since there is some overlap. Some companies will hire a UI designer as a UX designer. UI does not equal UX. Most companies will take a dedicated T-shaped professional over someone who thinks aesthetics are everything or that UX is limited to designing web interfaces. Learning code is a bonus, having research experience is a big bonus, and understanding how things like databases work is also a bonus (hard skills).

whatupsicko,"yo this was super confusing for me, i read the first few paragraphs and when i got to the image of the chat application, i was super confused and wonder what the hell it was...""is this part of the exercise brief?""...""is this your final submission?""

this seems like pretty basic UX to me, you didn't communicate what something was, and it was extremely not obvious (because the brief says they would like you to produce a fitness app + recording, analyzing, and understanding their activity, food intake, mood, etc)

if you had shown screenshot of something that looked remotely related, i could have guessed ""oh this must be his work - thanks for giving me a taste so i know whether reading the whole article is worth it"" (but even then you should still put a label on it, like ""My submission - Data analysis tab"")

for real tho, i spent so much time just trying to figure out what the hell that was...and when i got to the ""My own self-quantification"" - oh jesus - **Words in this document: 5780**, i think you missed the point of recording data...

Hours spent and how many post-its used are at the top of the good idea spectrum, with words in this document and songs listened to on spotify at the bottom

anyway i do like some of the layouts and i learned some things, but these are some pretty basic things that seem to me like the essential point of UX (User Experience)

you need to think about the user, will they be super confused by your shit? or not?

anyway i'm pretty sure you will strongly disagree with these points now and after 1 year or more you will agree with some of them, but i think there's 1 or 2 advices i can give you that you will agree with me about:

where it says ""instagram makes you depressed"", you should be more positive...first of all, your task is to design the UI while thinking about the UX...the functionality that ends up in the app is not what you are designing...did you spend a lot of time thinking about that instagram thing? because it seems like you are focused on app **functionality**, like ways the app will improve the user's life experience by identifying bad things that they can remove etc...you need to separate **interface** and **functionality**, then you will level up and can become a master...anyway for things like this, always put the positive version...if you think about it deeply, who actually it the user? and what will their experience be? you think it's some fat girl who posts her garbage on tumbler and eats ice cream, but in reality it's a guy in london looking through assignments from applications...if you want to think about functionality, think about how it will cause him to have a good experience and remember your app...

which brings me to the 2nd piece of advice, colors and themes etc...make something bright and memorable, even if it's only an ""alternative"", like show your skin that you chose, and then show like 1 or 2 other themes, maybe 1 with red, 1 with green, just yours seemed so boring

anyway, what kind of self data recording tool has a chat function, and not only that, why is it the ""main focus of the app""? if they asked you to design an interface for a chat application that also allows sharing photos and GPS-tracking their history etc with photos of restaurants and locations etc etc...would you make the focus of the app a music player that tunes itself based on past listening history of the user?

* What approach did the *actually get to implement*?
* What 2-3 things went right/as expected and wrong/not as expected?

From this you get:

* A sense of whether they proposed a nominally-correct research approach for the task at hand
* Whether they were successful in advocating for that approach given any time/budget constraints or conflicting opinions, and how they negotiated that exchange
* What they learned *from the experience of performing the research* (without asking them to divulge anything potentially confidential about the work they might have done.)
* And most importantly, how good they are at *communicating their findings*

babababrandon,"I think we’re already seeing the effects. I can’t remember the study, but wasn’t an article published recently that said junior designers with under 3 years of experience are having trouble finding work? Funny enough, I’m actually in the position I am today (a big name company rather than a startup) because a colleague warned me about the “UX bubble” and that having a big name on my resume would help me jump my career forward in a couple years once the market is saturated with designers fresh out of their boot camps. Probably the best advice I’ve received, I absolutely love my job so far. 

As far as moving forward, I’m honestly not extremely sure what we can do about it. UX is an awesome field, it pays well, it’s fun, and of course that’s going to make it very attractive. I think the job market will start shifting into more specialized roles so people can start to find their niche within design sooner than later, like developers who focus on a particular stack. The problem is there’s still so much ambiguity as to what “UX” is to most juniors, and most juniors start out as generalists, so specialized designers are hard to come by. They’re jumping out of school thinking they can do anything, so they apply for everything. ",1513557281.0

I graduated with a second degree in graphic design in 2008 and promptly tried to find work as a junior. That's when design was still the field everyone was trying to get into and the market was saturated. The income spiked and has now dropped, and many have moved onto web dev or UX/UI. In short, UX is the new ""graphic design"", in a lot of ways.

Unfortunately, the pendulum also swings and for those of us with more than three years' experience, we're being stopped at the door by not having 5-10 years (which is frankly somewhat ridiculous for such a new field).

Fundamentally, when choosing a candidate, having a grip on what UX *is*, the difference between UX, UI, research, and development is huge. Bootcamps do a disservice by not giving real-world experience, and not much moves slowly or easily in the UX world once you arrive on scene.

BevansDesign,"I really don't like pop-over modals in mobile interfaces. The screen just isn't big enough for them to retain the context that they would on a desktop screen.

Assuming that you're building some sort of form for the user to fill out, here are three options I'd use instead:

1. Keep the picker visible by default. There's nothing wrong with having the user scroll down a page filling out info.

2. Split the form into multiple pages, and put the picker on one of those. The user fills a couple related form fields on one page, hits Next, fills out a couple more, hits next, etc. Keep each page bite-sized and simple.

3. If you need to hide the picker, have it appear embedded in the page when the button is clicked. Use an animation to slide down the other content to make room, to make it clear that what the user is seeing is a part of the page, not above it. This one's a bit less useful, and harder to design properly, but I still think it's better than a pop-over modal.

I suppose my sense of value really developed out of starting to see my designs come to light. Not everything I've created has been a hit, but now and then a design really takes off, and those are the things I return to in darker moments to remind myself why I do UX.

Additionally, the support of my team has really boosted my self esteem. From day one I've always felt like I've made a solid contribution to my team's output. People have always listened to my opinions, and often have come to me for advice. (This probably says more about the juvenility of my team than about me though!)

BlueberryQuick,"Just in case my Update post gets flagged, this is what it said:

Alright, so I had my interview. It was meant to go for two hours but wound up lasting three hours and 15 minutes. Good sign? Or a sign of poor management? I dunno. It felt good, though.

I met with the project manager, lead developer, and director (I had a phone interview with the director days prior). The PM I felt got off on the wrong foot, or at least a slightly ""couldn't find the groove"" foot. It wasn't until we talked about research, working with developers, and how the role fits in with his role that we hit a stride. He seemed ready to finish the talk when it was done and I got a few questions in, but we left on a good note. If I had to guess, I think he feels I am perhaps under-qualified (and I am, a little).

The lead developer started off asking three questions from his notebook (""Do you know who Gestalt is?"", ""What do you know about ___ theory?"" and something else along those lines). I felt immediately that I had failed and we'd be done because I didn't know the answers, even though I had a chance at the end to ask why he asked that. Turns out I knew Gestalt and that theory, I just didn't know the name of it. Dirty pool. Anyway, he and I hit it off well particularly in the area of research, which was his focus of questioning. He asked about prototyping tools, software, preferred working style, etc. which seemed more fact-finding than reassuring him of something he already had an idea of. Also good.

The director and I have a great kind of vibe and we chatted for way too long. We went through my portfolio piece by piece and I explained all I could about it, then he handed me his phone and had me go through the app to give feedback good and bad. It was a very valuable talk and he was complimentary on my findings.

I do think they could find someone more tested than I am and who probably won't need to study up as much. But I also think because this is a new role for them, they don't want someone who's a genius that will confuse and scare them, and are happy to figure it out together (within reason).

I sent my ""thank you"" email within an hour and haven't heard back yet. They have at least one, if not two, others to interview and gave me the option to meet as late as 12/22, so I don't expect to hear definitively this week in case they have more people to get through (but I hope I hear something before the weekend).",1513635441.0

2. It’s easier for me to start off on paper and then digitize the work.

MarcRoflZ,"Hey quietword, I'll touch briefly on each of your questions to hopefully provide a foundation that you can use to move forwards in your initiative.  
  
1. In my experience, user journeys are at a higher level than personas. In most cases it should be a persona independent journey of how your customer; first hears of, gets into, and uses (& in some cases continues to use) your product to solve a problem they have. In most cases a persona is too specific to a sub-set of users to get a journey map. That being said, there is a limited number of circumstances when a journey map can be tailored to a particular persona. This is normally if the project is addressing the needs of a particular persona.  
  
2. This is going to be heavily dependent on what currently exists in your company now. I can't speak much to this other than to say trust your intuition.  
  
3. The answer to this one depends on what your project/ initiative is, what you are trying to solve and what your role within your company is. If you are going to be remaking the entire user journey then you'd want to work with stakeholders in the company to fully map out the journey and identify the pain points so you can lead your own initiatives (or team initiatives) to solve them. If your role is a little more junior maybe you are trying to map the journey of one experience and then work your way up to the entire experience either with a team or as your company gives you more and more lead to play with. How much of the journey you decide to map will be directly correlated to how much opportunity you discover, but is also much more time consuming and may not be what your company requires of you at this time depending on your experience and role.  
  
Hope that helps. I'm happy to talk more if you have questions!  
  
Cheers,

You should have a different journey for each persona, assuming their journeys are different. You can combine them into a single narrative if there are only a few points where they differ.

It sounds like you're unsure of how formal to make this. I would start informal, and solidify and mature it as the UX becomes more clear. Just like with agile development, you want to start with a sketch and iterate to make it mature as you go along.",1513104157.0

RedditBlow5,"We have this argument all the time but basically, I believe there is a bunch of confirmation bias going on against bootcamps. Self-taught users don't like bootcamps because they want to justify not having an education. HCI grads don't like bootcamps because they want to believe that their education was worth it, it is the only way to get into the industry and anything else short of that is just a cheap shortcut.

And yes all of the above are incredibly unfair and unexplored assumptions. And admittedly, what I am going to say is probably influenced by my own confirmation bias. And so are the assumptions on bootcamps. So you may as well get representation from all sides right?

Barring all that I think you should look at the data and see for yourself.

https://medium.muz.li/2018s-ux-designer-salary-forecast-32ccc1dfcd5f

Of all UX Designers surveyed, 65% self-taught, 31% Masters, 11% Bootcamp, 16% online cert (essentially a bootcamp). And because we don't have access to the methodology, we'll just have to assume the data is credible.

And yes, ironically this same link was posted on r/userexperience.

For the same reasons that people highlight that bootcamps don't give you the same education as a full program, it sure makes it difficult to explain that the majority of UX designers now are self-taught.

So my answer is, it depends. It depends how you can leverage your past experience, it depends what bootcamp you attend, it depends what effort you put into it. I went to a bootcamp because I wanted to get real-world, client experience. I was a real UX designer and a month after I graduated I took up a (hopefully) short-term freelance gig where I used the same things I learned and applied it to other projects.

Do some user research, go on LinkedIn and search for alumni, send them a message. Look at their portfolios if you're too shy to talk to them. General Assembly portfolios tend to not be very good, on the other hand, one of my favorite UX designers works at General Assembly Atlanta. 

Final word, go to a bootcamp if you want UX experience and to learn about the field, that is what it is for.

No one gives a shit about the certificate and it is a mistake to think that people sign up for bootcamps for it. And yes it won't guarantee you a job. No college does, although to be fair, I've never had the privilege of attending an HCI program. Would love to some day, not for the degree but to learn.",1513066269.0

Ezili,"If you have zero design experience, and you are sure this field is for you and you're not already in a role at a company where you work with UX Designers, I would go to school. 

Self taught can work, but if you have no experience you're going to spend a loooooong time teaching yourself from scratch without any guidance, and you're going to learn a lot of bad behaviours on the way which you'll need to unlearn. And I would claim, without data to support this other than personal experience, that the failure rate of self taught is much higher than those who go to school. By that I mean, I suspect most people who decide to self teach design from scratch to get a job in a technical role like UX and UI fail to find a role. Or at the very least, don't find as good a role, or take longer to get into a role, as those who have some formal training. 

Design isn't easy. Can you teach yourself? Yes, I got my first role as a self taught designer, but I was awful, and I had several years of development and game design work experience prior to it which allowed me to transition into the role at my company before I really should have. 
Whilst I wasn't directly aiming to get a UX role, I'd say beginning to end I'd say it took me 3-4 years gathering experience which eventually led to me being in that role, and probably another 3 years before I was any good. 

If I had known I wanted to be a UX designer, I would have gone to college for a degree in interaction design, communication design etc and saved a bunch of time.

clystars,"The adobe website has tutorials, and there are lots of tutorials on youtube as well. I'd highly recommend Graphic Design: The New Basics by Ellen Lupton and Jennifer Cole Philips.

Creative Workshop by David Sherwin is a personal favorite of mine, and is a great guide to exercising design skills as you learn them.

Html/css/javascript are really handy skills to have imo, especially because they give you agency to design and implement website/applications on your own. But they're not entirely necessary for ui designers (although having these skills will make you competitive). 

For ux, you're going to want to study psychology/human interaction with a focus on research/data analysis. Study research methods used by ux r&d to see what will produce useful information for different situations. 

Finally, put these skills into practice and document your process! Sometimes the design process is more important to show future employers than the final product.",1512783467.0
ed_menac,"First get some work experience. Try to find a UX designer or researcher near to you (try LinkedIn) and get in touch with them.

This will give you the best initial introduction to UX and you can decide how you want to specialise off the balcony of your experience.

Most people focus on one of the following:

* User research and usability testing

* Problem solving, user journey mapping

* Interaction and interface design

* UI art / UI design

* Coding (html stack) and accessibility

How you enter the field depends on which one you want to pursue at first.

A psychology, HCI or service design degree will help with the first three.

Graphic design or coding training will help with the last three.

I would also start reading books and using online courses to get a grounding in UX. Many are free and easily accessible.",1512844178.0
Ezili,"Comparative research.

Competitive you are looking at your direct competitors.
Comparative you are looking at things which don't compete with your product, but which may be familiar to your users or may set their expectations.. For example analogous products or services they experience and enjoy.

Typically we do these at the same time so it's what we refer to as Competitive/Comparative. 

That being said, what you're describing to me sounds a bit less based in user research (what your users actually already use - you haven't identified a significant number of your users visit or like the Smithsonian) and more just in analogous experiences you find inspiring.

barukTom,"Hi

In all the time I've been a UX designer (5 going on 6 years), I've met UX people from many backgrounds: architecture, programming, visual designers, engineering.

Given your question, I think the basic thing to remember is that Design is a problem solving skill. If you have a passion for solving complex problems and making things fast, effective and satisfying to use then by all means dive into it head-first.

You may need to do a certification (CUA at HFI or any recognised online course in your country) to even be considered for job interviews. Employers get a lot of CVs everyday, so don't give them a reason to discount you before you even get to the door.

However, I also think that with a CIS degree if you had a great portfolio then you shouldn't have too much trouble getting an audience with a potential employer. 

Or alternatively, look for ways to start practicing UX at your current job- you would be surprised how much impact you are able to make when applying design thinking to IT support. This would gain you recognition and give you a voice in the company regarding experience design.

Also, check out this article by a Senior UX talking about things to look out for when starting out in design:

OGKjarBjar,"I'm not really sure what this article has to do with UX, but it feels like the author is ""shredding"" the technology in the film so they have something to write about. The author is overly critical for the sake of being overly critical. It's a cartoon. For children. It was released 14 years ago. 

The whole point of filmmaking is to tell a story. The point of (most) animated cartoons is to tell a story to children. If Pixar spent all their time determining how Syndrome the computer would guide the user, what the password requirements were, whether or not the password is case sensitive, and the instructions to the next page, they wouldn't have had any time to create the actual movie. 

> When playing in the same genre as the Batmobile, the Iron Man suit, and — for all intents and purposes — every James Bond gadget ever used, you’re in the playground of the most creative and genius billionaires in the universe.

Do we see the Batmobile guiding the user, or do we just see Batman driving a really cool car with a screen and buttons that we have no idea what they are for? Do we see the user onboarding process for the Iron Man suit, or do we just see a quick montage of it getting made and then Iron Man wearing/using it? Should I now be mad that Thor's Hammer has no interface? Should I spend so much energy on being upset that The Incredibles GPS only has one button that I no longer enjoy watching the film? 

The ""user"" of the movie is the audience. The audience doesn't need to be bogged down with minute details that do not add to the story. Especially when that audience is mostly children with limited attention spans. That's like covering your website's landing page with 100 calls to action. Give me what I need to understand the story and have a good experience and nothing more. ",1512414216.0

TheKingdutch,"I am neither but my interpretation from a developer perspective:

Interactions require two way communication. If you design an interaction you design how a user gives input and receives feedback (or how a user receives input and gives feedback)

A user experience doesn’t necessarily involve any interaction. Sitting in a theater is very much a user experience that can be designed but there’s no interaction between the viewer and their experience. 

A Venn Diagram would probably show some overlap (possibly with UX containing Interaction Design as a subset of the possible user experiences).",1512206814.0
chasery,"My own understanding is UX is traditionally used as an umbrella term to describe any experience a user might have. Interaction design is a subset of UX that typically combines the user, an environment, and the product itself. E.g. Think of  a kiosk in a mall where they design an atmosphere to invoke a certain feeling or emotion from you to try and get you to buy their product. This usually includes thoughts around space, lighting, sound, emphasis on the product, etc.",1512226336.0
ArcticCat,"User experience design is the design of experiences, which may go beyond the interactions with a screen and usually deal with the full user journey of interacting with a company or product.  Interaction design is the act of creating particular human object (computer in most cases) interactions through mostly screen based designs these days.  Of course there are other means of interaction as well out there.

In teams hiring someone into a role where they would do full UX design, I would expect them to understand how to do research which deeply understands the product or experience from the users point of view, build IAs, perform interaction design to build out the specific interactions, prototype and test, and work with engineering teams to build those, and perform follow up studies to validate how those interactions improved the experience.  I would also expect someone in this role to tackle things that might not require interaction designs to fix the problem though.  They would be creating user journeys that identify pain points in any part of the user’s experience, and sometimes those result in work that is just coordinating with other teams in the business to improve the product offering in some way.  Example:  user journey identifies users are confused by the levels of purchasing and what they get with starter, intermediate, business, enterprise, and pro subscriptions.  This might mean going and working with the business to convince them there are too many levels, and we need to simplify the offerings so users don’t get stuck on this part of the experience.

An interaction designer role would focus more on screen design (if that is your medium of interaction) and less on many of the other activities I have pointed out above.  

Many teams do use the terminology interchangeably for UX designer and Interaction designer, and often interaction designers are meant to do more extensive UX design if that is what is needed for the product.  When you set up your resume and interview I would be clear with teams about your area of interest in this spectrum and their expectations of the role.",1512225712.0

GuiHarrison,"My thesis advisor was a interaction designer and I was graduating in a time when UX was getting all the attention on common companies. Because of that we ended up talking a lot about it.

And what I learned is that Interaction Design is how a user interacts with ANY human made artifact. That means that it can be a screen, of course, but this field of research happened before there was screens everywhere, so how you interact with a work desk, a hammer, a plate, all is IxD. This field this field happened to become more flashed out when the breakthrough that Douglas Engelbart brought us was recent so research tended to Human-Computer Interaction.

Now UX is maybe a bigger pot, because it's how a user experience the brand or the institution where the interface is placed in. So that means UX design has UI under it but also anything the user has to experience, even how the callcenter treats the user.

One example I like to bring up is that IxD is how a user uses a phone, UX is how the call goes with the company the user is calling. But you can imagine that both interlace with each other.",1512254060.0
cosmatic,"To jump on this question, I’m currently applying around for a new job. I have 5 years experience. Previously, I’ve gone with the label of UX design since it’s always seemed appropriate and accurate. 

Now, I’m not so sure. The last year had seen the rise of the Product Designer, which I personally really like as it better reflects the myriad of considerations that come into my work. 

Looking at job listings (top tier comps), I’m not seeing many ux requirements anymore. Lots of ‘product designers’, but the descriptions and responsibilities seem to be collapsed into “visual and interaction design”. It’s all buzzwords and semantics, sure, but when it comes to job applications this can make a big difference.  

So I guess my question is, is the labeling of UX, or even UX/UI, still relevant, or has this blended into visual/interaction design?",1512212707.0
Racoonie,"My definition:

Designing the possible ways the user interacts with the product and the feedback he gets while and after doing it.

I think a bit of confusion comes from the fact that some UX designers only have experience with web sites and there interaction is mostly limited to click/tap, maybe scrolling and swiping. There is no real interaction, you are mostly navigating. (I don't count ""filling out forms"" as interactions to be honest). 

However, I have worked on parts of a large desktop application for some years and interaction design there included things like

* keyboard shortcuts, especially use of modifier keys for changing the outcome of an interaction
* matching buttons or menu entries in the interface for these shortcuts
* states and behavior of items before, *while* and after an interaction (drag and drop being the most prominent example)
* interaction with elements that go beyond simple clicks (dials, sliders etc.)

And then if you start thinking about hardware products: Amount, layout and type of interaction elements and how they tie into the functionality of the product.

Create a wire frame of a site that aims to solve the challenges the participants faced in the original site. Test again, redesign. Test again, redesign. No matter how amazing your designs are there will always be users who find something challenging with it. Your job is to minimize those challenges to provide your users with the best user experience possible. Once you've collected all your data and completed all your design iterations you can present the final design to your client. Once the client and yourself agree on the new design it's handed off to a programmer. 

You do not need to be a programmer or a graphic designer to apply UX, in fact many discourage it as you can lose creativity in the design process if you worry too much about if the design is realistic.

As for prototyping tools, grab a pen and piece of paper.
If you are willing tho spend some money then balsamiq is a decent piece of software. In my opinion Axure is the best and most powerful of all the wire-framing and prototyping tools available but is also rather expensive at $400.

1) **Consolidate the nav into 5-6 'buckets.'** If you have access to Google Analytics, check to see how users currently navigate through the site, what pages they spend the most time on, etc., and restructure the IA altogether. For example, 'Outreach' is presently available in the 'What We Do' dropdown, so it could potentially be removed from the main (I don't have access to your data, so it 100% depends on how important that page is to the user journey - just an example). 

2) **Redesign header.** Another option, if you are able, would be to redesign the layout of the page header. For example, you could go with the more traditional layout of the logo on the left, 5-6 main nav items, then a toolbar of the other 5-6 items. Again, I'd refer to any analytics you have on the site to see which pages/sections are most used, and consider what pages/sections are most important to your goals.
