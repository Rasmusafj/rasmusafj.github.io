ykevin,"Looks like this AWS Lightsail was designed to compete directly with Digital Ocean droplet which starts from $5/month.

So, basically it's a bare VPS, right?

If that was right, the only ways to connect your WordPress business account ([WordPress.com](https://WordPress.com), right?) are:

* Setup and install self-hosted WordPress on your AWS Lightsail instance.
* Once you're done and your self-hosted WordPress is running there, then ...
* Login to the admin dashboard of your self-hosted WP, and Install ""Jetpack"" plugins on there. More about Jetpack: [https://jetpack.com/about/](https://jetpack.com/about/)
* Access your installed ""Jetpack"" on the left menu...and you'll be prompted to connect to your business account on WordPress.com
* Connect it to your [WordPress.com](https://WordPress.com) account so that you can login to your self-hosted WordPress with your WP business account and ...
* now your self-hosted WordPress on AWS Lightsail is fully integrated with your WordPress business account on [WordPress.com](https://WordPress.com)

If all of the steps above went correctly, you can:

1. Login to your self-hosted WP on AWS Lightsail using the business account, or
2. Login to your business account on [WordPress.com](https://WordPress.com) and...
3. manage everything on your self-hosted WP through [WordPress.com](https://WordPress.com) ( the datas between those two  like stats, posts, pages, etc will be synced up behind the scene.. thanks to that Jetpack plugins )
4. That means, you can create new post, create new page, edit existing ones, change the theme, etc, etc... on your self-hosted WP running on AWS, by using business account's dashboard on [WordPress.com](https://WordPress.com)

The challenge here is the first step: to install self-hosted WordPress on AWS Lightsail. I never used Lightsail but if it's just giving you a bare VPS like EC2, well... you need to install many packages first like: php, mysql, apache/nginx/or any web server to run php, and other required packages before you'll be able to install and run the WordPress there...",1543571509.0
CaptainFluffyTail,"What are the security benefits that AWS brings as opposed to other VPS providers? Just curious on this. You still have to patch and maintain the VPS instance yourself. Account control on the AWS account is certainly better and more flexible than most other providers, but that doesn't make a bit of difference to the VPS that is running. if Lightsail was some serverless option that allowed you to spin up a scaling dynamic website without having to manage the underlying host I could see the draw.

gd480,"My main concern with GoDaddy, based on the stuff you said they want to add, is that the mail relays included with their hosting are shared with other GoDaddy customers.

You should code from the beginning to connect to a service like [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com) with their API for email integrations.

There are many hosting types from GoDaddy,  my answer about what you should do strongly depends on the hosting plan your client has.

They're probably on cPanel. If so then you don't have much to worry about. GoDaddy has options that scale pretty well if they're on cPanel, from traditional shared to the highest end Business Hosting running in a container with 32gb ram and 4 CPU cores. Just be aware you can overbuy resources if your site isn't optimized well (page caching with wordpress, making sure to turn on PHP opcache, inefficient database calls or indexing, etc).

There are a couple less likely scenarios: If the plan they're on says ""Web Hosting"" and doesn't mention cPanel, that's an old platform that you can't buy anymore, and it's a good idea to get them on something more modern if you're rebuilding. If they're on a VPS or Ded, they've got enough power, but if they've had the same server for years they might be on legacy hardware. Also if they have their own server and no IT to run it, that's a recipe for disaster down the road.

firemandave6024,"I've worked I the industry for a few years, and I want to tell you this is a lot of work. Not to dissuade you, but to prepare you for the reality of running your own ecommerce site. And I'm going to tell some ugly truths about shared hosting in general. Keep in mind these are *not* about SiteGround or any other hosting provider specifically.

Since you're considering WordPress with Woocommerce, you are definitely going to want to build a relationship with a developer. It seems like WordPress has a new serious hack every version. 

Backups, backups, backups. Take regular backups yourself and follow the 3-2-1 rule. 3 backups, on two different media, and keep one offsite. Regularly verify your backups, because if you don't, you don't know if they're working. Don't depend on your host's backup service, almost all of them are ""best effort"", which means they either can't or won't guarantee that they can recover your files.

Keep your site CMS and plugins updated regularly. This helps resolve the bugs that allow attackers into your site. Take a backup before updating and confirm it works before running the update so you can roll back if something breaks.

Keep a development site somewhere. It should be a copy of your current live site so you can test changes. The last thing you want to do is add a plugin that destroys the function of your live site. Most hosts either have a tool to create the dev site or will do it for you for a small fee.

Keep your domain registrar separate from your host. I would also recommend a third party email service, such as Office 365 or G Suite. Most shared hosting email sucks because it's a web host, not a mail provider. And since the main IP of the server is generally shared with all users, you run the risk of the IP being blacklisted because someone got their site hacked or signed up for bargain barrel hosting to send spam.

Support options should include, at minimum, 24 hour email and phone support. Most shared hosting providers won't give you any development help, especially if you're spending $5-10/mo on hosting. Depending on where their support staff are located, your monthly fee may not even pay for an hour of a tech's work time. This is why they tend to rush you off the phone and why I recommend having a developer.

About a developer. You want a _developer_, not a _designer_. A developer should be able to dig into the guts of your site to fix bugs, eliminate malware, etc. A designer generally uses the GUI to make your site look good. When interviewing your developer (even if you go with a firm, interview! You are paying them, don't waste your money), ask about the languages they use regularly. If PHP isn't at or very near the top of the list, you don't want them. WordPress and Woocommerce are both built with PHP. Someone who specialized in the latest hotness for front end development isn't going to be able to help you add effectively.

How do you plan to accept credit cards? Are you going to use PayPal and redirect the clients to their site? Are you going to use Authorize.net to process credit cards through your site? If you accept credit cards, you have to be PCI compliant. This can be an absolute nightmare for a small website! You need to find a host that is willing to help you, because changes may need to be made to the server configuration that you will not be able to do on shared hosting. Your credit card processor (except PayPal) should schedule automatic PCI scans of your site and provide the results to you so you can fix any problems.

One last thing, ""SSL"" certificates. Don't worry about DV vs EV and all that crap. Just get a basic SSL certificate. I ran my own Magento site for a while and had no problems with sales using a free Let's Encrypt certificate. Anyone telling you it isn't good for ecommerce is full of crap. The only difference between that one and one you pay for is the free one expires every three months and most LE plugins auto renew them. 99.9% of your customers won't even know if you're using a free certificate.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.",1543157585.0

For multisite you want to be sure you have some resources, 4+ CPU cores available, RAM, etc., usually cheapo plans are very limited on CPUs, RAM, EP, Inode limites, I/O limits, etc..

Then you would want to set your memory settings in your wp-config.php file for:

define( 'WP\_MAX\_MEMORY\_LIMIT', '1024M' );

define('WP\_MEMORY\_LIMIT', '768M');

1) Hosts file (recommended) - Change your computers hosts file to load the domain (that the site will end up on) from your servers IP. This avoids having to make configuration changes within Wordpress and avoids the need to search and replace the database before going live


2) Build the site on a development domain - For this just add something like client1.yourdomain.com to virtualmin and build the site there. Once you go live, add the proper domain, move the files as required and search and replace the URLs/paths in the database

SwellJoe,"The Preview Website feature uses the local DNS server (if you're hosting DNS locally) to lookup the domain and then proxies your requests through the Webmin web server. It is probably not ideal for doing development work, since the URL will be very messy...more for just testing that the site is working on the domain before you switch your DNS to point to the server, and change the glue records for the zone to point to your Virtualmin server if you'll be hosting DNS.

When I'm developing a new site, I usually just add the domain to my /etc/hosts file (or whatever the equivalent of that is on Windows or Mac OS, but I use Linux on my desktop/laptop), so that I can make requests normally.

So, my usual workflow:

1. Create the domain in Virtualmin, install whatever I want on it.
2. Add the new domain to my hosts file, so I can browse to it locally.
3. If I need to share it with someone (a client or a coworker) I'll create an alias that is a subdomain within one of my other domains that's already hosted by me, so I have the ability to add an A record to that other domain. (To be clear: Create the alias within the new virtual server account. It just has a name in the existing domain.)

Virtualmin can create a separate zone for it and manage that record, if that's how you've got it configured, but I usually don't...I usually just make an A record manually in the BIND DNS module in the zone in which I'm putting the alias. (e.g. if I have ""swelljoe.com"" and want to put up a site for someone else to look at that's called ""awesomenewsite.com"" I'd make an alias within the ""awesomenewsite.com"" domain called ""awesomenewsite.swelljoe.com"" which can then be added to the ""swelljoe.com"" DNS zone). Virtualmin can also automatically add an alias for every new domain to your ""primary"" domain, so it's easier to develop without having to do any /etc/hosts file editing and previewing sites before DNS is setup is easier and without having to go through Webmin, but it's not something I want for every site, so I never have that feature enabled.

Also, I recommend you take some time to learn a little about DNS. It's going to be a source of pain and confusion or you until you do. It's so fundamental to everything on the internet.",1543181604.0

Keep your domain at a dedicated registrar, so if you decide to switch hosting at some point in the future it doesn't turn into a nightmare of control.

As for being slow and rude... that isn't called for at all, plus is the rep the one losing money? lol, why so serious son... ;)

Companies like SG are big... they shouldn't be so greedy as to cause grief for a client they have acquired just because they are looking for a deal to be extended to them during this time of the year when so many 'black friday' deals are out there.

ReviewSignal,"I'm actually trying to figure out which app posted that, it seems it got posted a bunch of times actually. Definitely an old link from 2010, seems it was loaded in and fired around black friday again (I wonder if it's done that every year since 2010 when bitly link was created). HostGator was actually wasn't an EIG brand when it was created and I definitely used them back then too! That's actually kind of neat something has been running that long.

Let's address some of your points, some guy posted a few fake tweets and my system picked up on them. Yup. Going to happen. Acknowledged it there, and now here. This is why I collect a lot of data, drowns out the noise. Scaling up that sort of manipulation takes a lot of effort and gets easier and easier to detect.

I love the sentiment I'm getting rich, I've been transparent about that too. https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/building-a-3-000-mo-review-service-as-a-solo-founder-e1ddcc26ac It's actually gone down since that interview. Closer to $2000/month these days sadly. I actually make most of my money as a software developer, that's the bulk of my income. I'm actually super excited about the project I've been working on most of the year finally went public! https://domainnamewire.com/2018/11/20/udrp-tools-launch/ it's a search engine for legal cases in domain arbitration courts (UDRP). It's an unprecedented research tool mainly for lawyers and domain name holders. 

If you want the stats on my HostGator earnings, the last sale I referred to them was August 2014. Not even sure that affiliate link even works anymore, it's migrated over to ImpactRadius and I never changed it. Oops. I should probably update that. I don't discriminate against hosting companies either, just because it's EIG or any other company. Unless they've really crossed some horrible lines (Hostinger I will never do business with). EIG is a real company, publicly traded and decent people there. It's a shame their business model tends to favor selling as hard as possible and cutting costs anywhere they can. I may not agree with them but I don't discriminate either - they participate in my annual WordPress Hosting Performance Benchmarks and get treated like any other company - as they should be.

People want honest and good data, it requires being open minded enough to actually deal with companies of almost all sorts.

So yes, I do business with EIG, it's very little. 4 sales for bluehost this year, I'm puzzled actually looking at the referrers considering how not well ranked they are, but someone out there decided ok, I'm buying this, and I'll take the check. I give people data to make their own decisions, what they do with it, that's their prerogative.

I doubt this post gets deleted, just like the other threads, playing the victim and hiding behind anonymity is always fun. I'm always happy to engage and I'm not hiding behind anything or living any double life. I continue to stand behind my data and providing honest reviews, what you choose to believe, that's up to you. But I appreciate you noticing that tweet and now I have to hunt down an old cron job or app that has post permissions.",1543016224.0

So, in that case, the best option is indeed reseller hosting.  BUT...

Stay away from the big name, well known hosting companies.  They have too many customers to be able to give proper attention when support is needed or like other stories in this thread when their server goes down you are in the dark until they come back up.

\- A great Reseller program with discounts based on numbers of accounts - [https://www.icdsoft.com/en/reseller](https://www.icdsoft.com/en/reseller);  
\- Custom-built tools for resellers that provide them with a quick and easy way to set up a store to resell our products, complete with PayPal integration for simple billing OOTB;  
\- Tech Support team that's praised for knowledge and turnaround speed, and is at full disposal for your end clients. 

The basics, which any shared hosting provider should offer:   
\- A full LAMP stack with PHP 7.1 and 7.2, a.k.a your WordPress bread and butter;  
\- Daily backups, kept on the servers for seven days;  
\- Free Let's Encrypt fully integrated in the Control Panel;

Going forward, rules 1, 2 and 3 for keeping your site secure are ensuring that you disable any plugins you don't explicitly need, and keep all plugins, themes, and WordPress itself up to date whenever updates are released (99.9% of WordPress site compromises are via security holes that've already been patched via an update, that simply hasn't been applied).",1542639003.0

The first thing I would look at is your site security, use a plugin like WordFence or similar and check the security of your WordPress web application and all plugins.

GoDaddy and other companies like them that are publicly traded companies, in my opinion, focus on their bottom line and not on providing true services to their clients, they are too focused on making their share holders happy and not the clients they serve. This is why they will flip you over to their 'experts' for $100-$200 or more charges, even when there is no need to do so.

If Godaddy provided daily backups on there services you could easily roll back your plugins, files or your entire cPanel installation to a period prior to your files going missing or database information losses, etc., but they don't to my knowledge.

archivedsofa,"> I am completely unsure how to configure DNS properly for a domain using DO

You do it at the domain's control panel. Add an A record with the IP of the VPS. Then if you need multiple domains on the VPS it's an NginX configuration.

But returning to the general question, I'd say it depends on the type of project, how much your client values performance, your skills, etc.

If you are not a sys admin I would advise you against managing your own servers via terminal and such. It's easy to get started, but getting everything right is very time consuming. And get ready when something doesn't go according to plan.

You could just have a Runcloud or Serverpilot account and manage any number of servers. Some clients will want better performance so put them in their own VPS and scale according to load. Cheap clients can go to a shared VPS.

You could also try with some script manager like CentminMod, Webinoly, etc, but again when something goes not according to plan you will be on your own.

adxp,"If you are planning to manage your VPS (droplet), I'd advise reading about DNS, basic services (apache, mysql, ssh, ftp, crontab, postfix, dovecot) and PHP, if on Linux.   

   

The DNS can be managed on the platform the nameservers are pointing at. That platform can either be a DNS provider like [DNS.he.net](https://DNS.he.net) or Cloudflare or BIND server running on your droplet, but I'd generally advise managing the DNS externally out of the Droplet.

**A record:** DNS record responsible for the website content. It should be pointing to an IP address. 

It's usually the root (@ or the non-www version of the domain) that should be pointing to the server IP first: [domain.com](https://domain.com)

You'll also need to create a DNS record for [www.domain.com](https://www.domain.com) \- the www subdomain.

You can either create an A record called [**www.domain.com**](https://www.domain.com) pointing to the same IP as the root (@ or non-www), or create a **CNAME** record and point it to the non-www hostname [domain.com](https://domain.com)

**MX Record:** Is the DNS record responsible for the emails. It tells where the emails for a that domain should be going. 

**SPF Record:** It's a DNS record that is added into the zone as a TXT Record. It tells which servers are permitted to send emails on behalf of a domain. It prevents spoofing, so, it's important to have. There's a site called SPFWizard which can help you set it if you have an email server or need to configure one.

You also need to consider that some clients want hands on cpanel access and others want to host their custom CMS stuff. So establish early on what you are willing to host and stick to that.

Emails should never be on your server. It's a mess to deal with and trust me, you are better off setting up a referral link to Office mail or Gsuite or any other email provider.  Emails come with legal issues and in some cases can take down your whole server if your IP's are blocked due to spam and hijack of email accounts.

J0tS,"The problem with WordPress is that it's so popular that a lot of not-so-good (or strictly bad) programmers work with it and develop elements that allow most marvelous exploits to take place. Also, hacks of WP sites happen may more often than other popular CMSes since you have such a huge demand/playground for it. Unless you have taken every single step listed here: [https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/secure-your-wordpress-website/](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/secure-your-wordpress-website/), the fact that your site was hacked is 100% your fault. If not, then you were unlucky to get affected by some new exploit.

&#x200B;

Shared hosting uses various ways to isolate users from one another (you can google what CloudLinux/cagefs is, for example) and, unless you had somethings like WWD (world writable directory, place which anyone can write to) in your site or they did not use isolation systems, your hosting provider has next to nothing to do with your hacked site.

&#x200B;

Still, some companies offer more security measures than others. For example, the is a very effective antivirus called CXS (ConfigServer Exploit Scanner) that is more effective than free/default systems. Basically, it will not allow you or your scripts to upload and execute any known malware to the sever . Does not mean it will be stop something no one knows about yet. There are things called WAFs (web-application firewalls) that stop known exploits as they come in (for example, mod\_secuirity). Again, known exploits.

No, your A record points to your host machine, in this case the server rented to you by oneprovider.com. The MX records point to your ""Mail eXchanger"". Google's help docs will tell you the right MX records to use, which are usually:

`yourdomain.tld	3600	IN	MX	1 aspmx.l.google.com.`

`yourdomain.tld	3600	IN	MX	5 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.`

It sounds like they don't offer DNS service, so you should probably just use GoDaddy's for now.

GoDaddy sucks, so you should consider transfering your domains to a different registrar. When you do that, you should take care to export a backup of your whole DNS zone, so you can be certain to re-create any important custom records at the new registrar.

It's down to personal preference really. Some say yes, keep them separate so that if your host vanishes overnight you still have control over your domain, others prefer the ease of having both the domain and hosting with the same provider (the host can't then tell you ""not our problem"" if there's any kind of issue with your domain itself).

Using your specific example though, DigitalOcean don't provide domain registration services.

DigitalOcean provide unsupported bare virtual machines. You'll be given the root login details to a server and what you do with it is then entirely down to you. If you're just looking to get a site online and working easily, this is not what you want (despite what subsequent replies will undoubtedly tell you).

If you want an easy and straightforward solution, you want a shared hosting account, not your own VPS. As above, the hosts listed in the sidebar are generally a good start (you're correct that EIG brands should be avoided, along with GoDaddy).

Whitestrake,"Dunno if Vultr uses virtio? If they do, you'll probably want to slipstream virtio storage/network drivers. It'll probably be fine.

You'll keep your IP unless you delete the server. For peace of mind, go to the ""Reserved IPs"" section and add new. It'll cost $3mo, but that IP will be for your usage to assign to whatever Vultr server you want, so even if you add another server later on and want that to be your Rust server, you can just move it over - and it won't disappear if you delete all your actual servers.

Their DDOS protection will be necessary if you think it's likely you'll be targetted. You can use their own firewalls to prevent non game traffic, which will solve a lot of that, but if a malicious actor targets your game ports with a flood, you'll either get null-routed (your server disappears from the internet) if you don't have DDOS protection, or Vultr will attempt to mitigate it and keep you online if you do pay for protection.

Endda,"I can't comment on the Windows side of things, but I use Vultr and have been very happy with them (after going from Digital Ocean to Vultr, to UpCloud, and then back to Vultr).

As long as you keep the same server, the initial IP address stays the same. Even if you 'rebuild it', as long as you don't destroy it and then create a new instance then you will still have the same IP address.

If you are concerned though, you can pay for the Reserved IP which would be tied to the account itself and you can 'convert' a newly created instance IP address to the reserved IP address (for example.

So for example, if you needed more hardware, that would require you to get a new instance, so that would give you a different instance IP, but you could then convert that IP to your reserved IP and then you wouldn't lose any progress in Rust.

I’d also take a look at posting on webhostingtalk.com or searching there, my bet is if they just up and disappeared like that, even as a “small company” there’s gotta be other people in the shitty situation you are finding yourself in.  Sorry to hear about your troubles. This is the sort of thing that used to happen all the time back when I owned a hosting company (I sold it in 2007 after running it for 6.5 years).

And I hate to say it (because it’s often said, and it’s potentially not of any use to you now) but KEEP BACKUPS, people!  Also choose quality hosting companies that have sustainable business models and are actual real registered corporations.

I’d almost **guarantee** that they are running off of the shitty “business model” I mentioned previously.  They *claim* to have weekly backups of sites hosted with them, stored offsite to an Amazon S3 setup. Who knows if this is true?  They also say they’re a registered company in the UK.

StrongestCoffee,"> 1) Is it possible to pay only for the Domain Name Registration in Bluehost?

Yes it is completely possible but my suggestion would be to go to a better domain registrar Here is a good list of registrars: [porkbun](https://porkbun.com), [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com), [google domains](https://domains.google/#/), [ghandi](https://www.gandi.net/en), [namesilo](https://www.namesilo.com), [internet.bs](https://internetbs.net//), [uniregistry](https://uniregistry.com). My recommendation would be to move the domain now you can still continue the hosting in bluehost since the DNS settings will point to it. 

> 2) Is it possible to host the webpage in AWS and have the mail in G Suite? Is this recommended?

It is possible and it is recommended to separate your operations incase one goes down not your whole operation goes down.  This is down in the DNS settings. what you would do is make the A record point to AWS using the IP and make the MX records point to Gsuite. 

&nbsp;

Now going back to the first point the reason I say to move your domain from bluehost is because issues have occurred with her having problem with having the domain with a hosting company while hosting with a mother company and also sometimes losing the domain.  You can have the Domain with any registrar after that you can have the NS server (the thing that tells where the DNS settings are) with the registrar, with your hosting provider, or even with another company that focuses on DNS such as CLoudflare/DNSimple ect.

If you need a PHP version from 5.3 or older, then you're going to need to look into CloudLinux.  That is supported on cPanel servers and involves an additional license fee. 

You might want to review the [supported PHP versions](https://www.cloudlinux.com/php-selector) under CloudLinux to see if that would work for you.

There are some shared hosts that have CloudLinux and support older PHP versions, [No Support Linux Hosting](http://www.nosupportlinuxhosting.com/FAQ.html) is one.

If you're reselling hosting and you think your customers will lookup your domain to see what nameservers you are using then using custom nameservers makes sense.

I've never heard of this before, sounds like a lack of understanding from the person/people that told you that. Custom/Private naemservers are vanity only, they use existing DNS servers.

It can however, make it easier if you have many domains using them and you move to another provider.

Another thing to think about is sending mail from the server. With cPanel and the like, it's easy to forget that all your mail is configured and ready to go. With RunCloud it is not.

They really aren't best in class, they're just widely advertised. It's a marketplace mostly dominated by the ""Oh I've heard of them"" phenomena, where people are so overwhelmed by choices, combined with a certain amount of ignorance about the technology, that brand recognition plays the largest part in their selection. But having a recognizable brand has nothing to do with offering competent service. Anyone with a budget and a good marketing team can build a recognizable brand.

I recently came across an HN thread that actually changed my mind a bit. These shared hosts have costs to cover too. Majority of the Bluehost customers pay about 10 dollars a month, and people expect top notch support from them. 

I don't use shared hosts anymore, and I know my way around servers enough to deploy my own and troubleshoot. There is a massive difference between managed hosting and unmanaged hosting when it comes to anything beyond shared hosting. Amazon for example has no support and you have to pay for support. If you hire someone to fix something for you, it's ~$100/hr. 

Now with shared hosts, the support requests are sometimes unreasonable. I'm not saying _your_ request was so, but having worked with many clients who formerly used shared hosts, their complains are related to whatever application they were running, be it a PHP error or some shitty htaccess copy paste gone wrong. cPanel is quite good at isolating things and it is hardly a problem at the web host. 

Many people pay $10/month and demand $100/hr support, where in reality Bluehost themselves are probably paying less than $10/hr or they can't run a business. 

I recently met a couple of Site Ground support team managers for a drink. Site Ground is known for not having shitty support like Bluehost. Site Ground indeed hire good support staff, and that is in fact reflected in their prices. 

I know financing web hosting is sometimes hard, and there are parts in the world where you make about $10 a day.

siteground,"Hi YayOrangeJuice,  


We were sorry to hear you feel this way. Please allow us to clarify the subscription options we offer with our services. During the order process on the checkout step you can select the period for which you want to purchase a plan. We have a free trial option of 1 month that also comes with a setup fee.   
Shared hosting plans are on a yearly subscription and you can choose a period of 1,2 or 3 years. With the yearly plan we waive the setup fee for the account and offer you a 30-day money back guarantee, so you can get a full refund within that time.  
To prevent downtime for our clients we have an auto-renewal system in place that renews the account for your website as in the absence of payment we suspend your hosting. You can manage the settings for renewal and billing via your client area and disable future charges. As you have acknowledged, we send email notifications about your upcoming account expiration and we inform you that we will attempt to renew the account. We understand that is unfortunate that these messages have gone into your spam folder and you did not receive them. Yet, when you log into your client area you can see a pop up about expiring service as well, and also cancel the account after the 30 days for which you needed it have passed. We offer a refund on renewals only within a month after the day it was processed, because you mention that you have used the service for 2 months after that, you are no longer eligible to get it.

>There are countless reasons why your business should not use GoDaddy. Here are the 3 biggest problems with GoDaddy websites:    


 >GoDaddy Problem #1: Zero Flexibility

>GoDaddy’s website builder might have a lot of pre-made designer templates that seem great for your business’s website, but there’s a major downside: you have zero flexibility. Once you pick a theme to use, you can’t switch to another without losing all of your content.    

>GoDaddy Problem #2: Reliance on Third-Party Tools

>GoDaddy’s website development isn’t its bread and butter. As a result, their website building tool is missing a lot of common functionalities that help make a small business website successful. This includes traffic driving aspects such as newsletters, maps, and more. However, GoDaddy does allow you to incorporate them into your website, but there’s a catch: you have to use third-party apps. This means that you will be responsible for properly using them. As a result, GoDaddy essentially doesn’t really do the time-consuming and challenging design work, you do.    


>GoDaddy Problem #3: Poor Mobile Display

>Nowadays, having a mobile responsive website that can be viewed on desktops, smartphones, tablets, etc. is essential for success. While GoDaddy’s website builder automatically converts your business’s website into a mobile-friendly interface, the mobile display is basic at best. And having a poor mobile display is a major issue for any and all websites. Consumers expect businesses’ mobile sites to look just as high quality as they do on a computer, and GoDaddy’s does not. As a result, GoDaddy’s basic mobile version of your website can actually harm your brand.    

>This GoDaddy website review is not the only one to unmask serious problems with GoDaddy. In fact, according to [consumeraffairs.com](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/internet/godaddy.html#sort=helpful&filter=none)
, there are hundreds more. Each of these reviews come from businesses working first-hand with GoDaddy and explain all their trials and tribulations of doing so. Out of 5-stars, GoDaddy receives only 1 for overall customer satisfaction.

>The customer complaints are long and frightening. In addition to the problems with GoDaddy covered above, their issues range from jacking up prices and charging credit cards without consent to horrible customer service and holding domain names hostage, as well as everything in between. Many people warn others from using GoDaddy’s services, and we advise you listen so one day you don’t have to give out warning of your own.",1541090004.0

Here is a positive: I had a buddy sign up to a server plan like 15 years ago and he has a WAY faster server at Godaddy with very few shared sites on it.

GoDaddy can be a PAIN when they are limited, and when issues arise. Their managed wordpress option is good 99% of the time, but when it messes up, it's very annoying to fix. 

Had a bad case where one server wasn't working well to distribute assets (and using a CDN can be complicated with GoDaddy), and we tried a lot of things to PROVE it wasn't GoDaddy (using GTMetrix) but found out it actually was THEIR infrastructure failing to serve 17kb css files (12 seconds to fetch them, EACH). Had to instruct them to move the site to another server cluster, which took a few hours, and did lead to some down-time. 

I can understand technical issues are hard to handle for a large company, but some of the issues are baffling. 

For most people, they will be more than good enough, especially for personal sites. 

They have gotten better, and keep WordPress updated, as well as offering PHP7.2 for WordPress now, which is much faster and safer than PHP5.4.

In the end, GoDaddy is DECENT, but not perfect. They try to cater to the ""general"" use cases, so if you need specific things, it can be tricky.

randomuserfromint,"1. I'd suggest you to get a static IP from your ISP. Most ISPs block the port 80 on dynamic IP address. Make sure that upload speed is good because browsers will *download content from your server* to view the contents. 

2. Install an OS (CentOS or Ubuntu or Fedora Linux suggested but Windows will also do) and configure it. Now, configuration part is pretty huge if you're serious about stability and security but at a bare minimum you should configure the firewall, HTTP server (IIS on Windows or Apache/nginx or any other on Linux) for static content. If you need dynamic content then add PHP, MySQL, Ruby On Rails etc to it. Configuring them too. 

3. Purchase a domain and add an A Record that points to your static IP.

And you have a basic system that acts as a web server. I run a server on my workstation at home. I use it when I have to send someone a huge file. I just place the file on my system and send them the link. They always ask me how do I upload such large files so quickly. 

At least once in life try running a web server, email server from your home system. You'll see how much it takes to run them. You'll start respecting other web services.

CaptainFluffyTail,">I’ve searched several different iterations of this question and haven’t found an answer. 

You're unlikely to find one tutorial that covers everything you want to do, end-to-end. Break it up into pieces.

>Ideally I want to learn to host a website for learning purposes on my buddy’s home server.

So you don't have control of the server or the network? That makes changes...interesting. Your buddy (or anyone in that house) could make a change and knock you offline.

>It would be great to have a tutorial that went from installation of the LAMP stack all the way to purchasing a domain and getting my website onto the internet without a hosting service.

Break it into pieces. Find a tutorial (or subreddit) for each.

1. Purchase your domain. Might as well get it done first since it is the thing you have least control over (somebody else might register it first).

1. Figure out what you want your website to be. Static/dynamic, particular platform, etc. That can change your stack choice.

1. Install the LAMP stack (or other depending on above).

1. Learn to harden the stack or choice.

1. learn that your buddy' network is shit and has a shit home router. Figure out how to do the port forwarding based on brand/model.

1. learn about dynamic DNS and how to fake having a static address for the purposes of hosting. The techniques here can change.

1. Point your domain to your dynamic DNS resolver.

Seriously though you may want to look into the low-cost hosting market, especially if you have static content. Learning the LAMP stack and how to build websites is great, but it can be a real pain to rely on a residential ISP connection for something you want others to see. if you have an educational email address (.edu) then you can get free credits to various platforms to use their resources too.",1541025730.0

502 means the web server (Apache or Nginx) was unable to handover the request to PHP for processing because PHP was too busy with something else.

Try to optimize your nignx caching as much as you can. Your db calls are what's going to be the slowest and take up the most resources. See if you can cache those through nginx or even redis. Read up on configuring your db settings to maximize your resources. Also look into a proper swapfile configuration. You're talking about scaling vertically but you have to think about scaling horizontally too. DO has some metrics/APIs you can use to see what you need. It's easy to just keep updating RAM but CPU upgrading can get expensive fast so load balancing your db is usually a good first step. This also helps for backups. 

Scaling servers on the cloud is a career in it's own and can get pretty complicated. I'ts not just about ram/cpu but website load time as well. Try to see what load times look like when your site is at it's peak. If you really want to get fancy, you can use DO's API to bring servers up/down based on resource usage.",1540774250.0

You mentioned that you are having a custom website built.  Custom websites are hardly ever built these days. Furthermore maintaining custom website can be a real headache if you don’t know what you’re doing.  Wordpress might be the most doable option for you right now, but from what you’ve described about having people login and manage/view their own dashboard area, it might be tough to pull off with WordPress.

OriginalSimba,"> TLDR: LiquidWeb has transitioned from ""Heroic Support"" to ""Cowardly Support"". Here I sit with broken servers that LiquidWeb broke and I can't even reach support to get it resolved.

I've had a bad feeling about those guys for months. The hype about their service since they hired a popular tech blogger has been ridiculous. Their prices are too high and they believe ""containers"" are equal to virtual machines, which shows a lack of real understanding of the technology.

As a result of their model, they've had a few major outages which have negatively impacted hundreds of customers. In that regard, ""containers"" are hardly any better than shared hosting.

For a company to charge as much money as they do, why don't they just build virtual machines? It's not as if they can't afford to. This is a serious question to examine. My conclusion is they're either lazy, incompetent, or they use containers because it gives them a better profit margin. Whatever the reason, it's not a model that serves their customers first.

I'm of the opinion that when you're charging $100/mo or more for hosting, the customers' interests should really be your first priority.

HereNThereNAround,"Sorry to hear that - I've been with Vultr for around 18months and never had any outage issues.  I found their support to be quick and competent.  However, when something bad happens, I guess the proof of a really good hosting company is in how they deal with it and it sounds like there was some communications issues at least, not to mention slow resolution time.

I suppose the takeaway from this is always have accessible backups on a different network.  You could look at Amazon S3, Google Drive, Dropbox - it doesn't matter, so long as you can restore the data to a new instance somewhere else.

&#x200B;

I am also with Cloudflare and adjusting DNS is fairly straightforward, but as mentioned in this thread, the two other issues are TTL on local networks (can be up to 24hrs in some regions) and also, if you're using any kind of database, how to not lose data when switching over to the backup, and then when switching back to the master after restoration.

Recently, I was looking into Google Cloud High Availability options ([https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/high-availability](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/high-availability))  - however, going from a Vultr server (around $40 month) to Google Cloud will be very different cost structure !!

KH-DanielP,"Howdy /u/wallofbytes

Most likely you won't really get what you are looking for. You can likely use some various benchmark scripts to gather this data, but a good portion of providers are employing solutions like CloudLinux which limit / restrict your ability to access to a majority of the listed resources. So your reports won't reveal the true hardware capacity but likely will reveal or get close to revealing their individual acct limits.

I'd personally step back and ask what your end goal is going to be with these tests? Some of the things you want to benchmark would also be relatively useless if they only executed for 2-5 seconds, on the other hand, testing network capacity for 10-20 minutes might get you noticed as potentially having something abusive on your account.

If I recall there's a popular VPS benchmark script out there but I can't remember the name off the top of my head, but it does indepth read/writes among other things so it's intended to be a one-off as it can be resource intensive.

You get cloud hosting with no physical server causing issues with downtime due to server issues as your instance is a VM spread out over many physical machines.

I'm sure you can find a hosting company online that would match your needs with a little searching.

Everyone gets all wound up about AWS and Azure and Google Cloud, yet for 95% of the people out there the learning curve is high and problems follow, get a managed cloud service that doesn't break your bank and you will be set.

We never have issues with our cloud VM instances, I can't say that for Google Cloud servers, we had all kinds of issues with their cloud when we used it for our shared and reseller hosting packages nearly a year ago, random host name changes, etc., not good when you are trying to run your apps. ;)

Keep in mind that different VPS configurations will have different failure modes, too - some will put a hard cap on your CPU and memory, some will let you use swap space (useful for *temporary* OOM conditions, major impact if you're skimping on RAM consistently), etc - so your host and virtualization platform matter.",1539485679.0

You had a 503 error. Check your error log. There should be a PHP error that will help you find the root cause.

For example, if they just give you cPanel on Apache for your server you will have issues on a higher traffic site or if you have PHP processing going on that is laboring in the background etc., you would do well to have a more advanced web stack setup such as Apache/NginX with custom templates for apps like WordPress and Drupal, Joomla, etc.

Better yet to have a host that will setup your server this way for you and also provide backups, full server config for performance, etc.

I don't know anything about Cloudey, but it has been my experience from other hosts that I have had VPS or Dedicated machines that are setup by their staff... you get no real setup, just installation of cPanel... that is it. Many times they won't even do the initial setup of cPanel's setup, i.e. your first login you are doing the settings in WHM... they didn't do a darn thing for you. (Ask them how they 'setup' your server, what is involved.)

This is one of the reasons I started my own hosting company.

I would bet dollars to doughnuts that you could, with a little searching, find a host that would provide you a high level of cloud service with a fully tuned and setup server for less than what you are paying now and not have the hassles you are going through.

BTW, the 503 error sounds like the server is using up resources, have you done a 'top' command on your server to see what your memory, cpu, etc. usage looks like or if you have any unusual processes running when you have a 'bonk' on the server?

Yurishimo,"I've used a few hosts so I'll share my experiences.

Siteground - I just recently moved a lot of sites off of a VPS on their platform. While the service itself is okay, the support leaves a lot to be desired. Just recently I had a client with their own Siteground account come to us after an outage and the response from Siteground on what caused it was unacceptable. They were citing plugins that don't run at all unless an admin clicks a button on the settings screen.

Digital Ocean w/ Serverpilot (or similar): the price here is hard to beat and the performance is generally good too, however, if something does go wrong you're fucked. We had 30 sites running on a large droplet and MySQL got corrupted during an unfortunate shutdown. Cue 24 hours of no sleep while I manually restored all of these sites from backups. I could not get Serverpilot to help at all even though it's their scripts managing the entire server. That was an expensive lesson. If you are not a sysadmin, do not use tools like ServerPilot or RunCloud because when shit breaks, you need to be able to fix it.

These days we're using Flywheel to host 40-ish sites on one of their agency partner plans. Under the hood, I believe it's running on a digital ocean droplet, but the important part is that I as a developer don't have to manage any of it. I have less control over some things (no SSH access) but I don't really need it for the vast majority of WP builds. If something breaks, I know they will fix it immediately. Their support is wholly based in the US as well so no communication barriers which can be important if we have clients who don't want to pay us directly for hosting but want our recommendation on choosing a webhost.

With whatever decision you make, also be sure to use some sort of remote monitoring/backup/update tool. I use ManageWP (which is owned by GoDaddy) and I've been happy with the service. I'm grandfathered in to a pretty sweet plan that I don't intend to abandon anytime soon so long as the service stays good.",1538744122.0
RandyHoward,"I haven't used managed hosting in a number of years, so take what I say with a grain of salt. I think you'll find that the offerings are similar across the board, it's primarily going to be a difference of price. I've personally used WPEngine in the past - many years ago - and had a decent experience with them from what I remember. They may cost more, but in the world of hosting you tend to get what you pay for *especially* when it comes to support. Like you said, most of your optimizations on speed are things you'll do yourself. I don't recall if I've actually seen hosts list server response times, but I suspect that won't be a terribly accurate measure because response times can vary depending on what is happening with the server at any given moment, and in a shared environment which you will likely be in there is no guarantee of what is happening elsewhere on the server to impact those response times. Just looking at WPEngine's current pricing table, there's little offered in information about speed. There you're basically picking plans to cover traffic, bandwidth, and storage space. I suspect others will be similar so I doubt you'll even be able to compare response times unless you can find domains that are hosted with each and test them yourself.

I would say yes, but unless you:

Just with that number alone and you being an individual I would say it's not required.

The reason it's more expensive is because it's on a better system than you're on. Their backbone is AWS or Google Cloud. They have their own caching techniques. WP is auto updated. You get a Staging environment. Daily backups with push-button restores. Amazing service. Get deployments. Honestly, just a whole bunch of stuff.

It sounds like your biggest problem is your theme and how it's handling images. Can't offer much in the way of suggestions because it will depend on your theme and whatever else you have installed.

You might try WP Smush. It will try and auto optimize your images when you upload them. It's something you should look at too. You probably don't need to upload any image that is larger than the average screen. Something like 1920x1080. And hopefully your theme isn't using that full size image as the thumbnail or something.

* No such thing as serverless. It's a dishonest marketing term where everything is abstracted away from the user and you pay for runtime.

I've never heard of Plone/Zope and their site is full of marketing jargon rather than technical details but it looks like it runs its own webserver with Python. There are some places that offer cPanel that allow python to run under the shared user but it's not really default behavior.  cPanel is built around administering a shared Apache webserver/PHP/MySQL environment.

Reselling is the best thing that happened to me, and I WISH I got into it in the begging, I would have more income as reselling has made it incredibly easy to setup hosting for clients and get money each month off of it.

It's all as hard as you make it. If you overload yourself with needy clients , yeah your gonna get hanged the moment there is down time (or if fucking original fa fa icons upgrade and your themes are fucked until THOSE guys fix it)

But if you take on clients who don't know or care two shits about hosting and just want a static site up, it's practically easy money.

RandyHoward,"It sort of depends on the nature of the sites that you build. Personally I wouldn't use shared hosting for any business. But that doesn't mean dedicated hosting is your only option. There's also virtual private servers, which are kind of in between shared hosting and fully dedicated hosting. A VPS is shared in the sense that one server contains many VPS's. You might have a VPS running 30 sites, and Bob might have his own VPS running 300 sites, all on the same server. The advantage of this over shared hosting is that you get much more control than with shared hosting. You can't just go in and reboot the server on shared hosting - but you can on a VPS. Dedicated hosting is essentially the same as a VPS, except you have the *entire* server to yourself, no sharing hardware with anybody else at all. The costs for dedicated can get pretty expensive too depending on your needs.

So, personally I'd probably go with a VPS in your situation. You *can* go dedicated if you want, but from what it sounds you don't necessarily need it yet, so why spend the extra cash. Avoid all hosts owned by EIG, they are terrible. Hostgator, Bluehost, and iPage that you listed are all owned by EIG, so do not use any of them.

craigleary,"cPanel recommends cloudlinux as your operating system. if you are doing shared hosting I recommend it for the security (cagefs) and the ability to control resources better.

* MySQL 5.7 or MariaDB 10.2?
 Speed wise I see no difference. The default is mysql 5.7. The only thing you may notice is both by default use strict mode on, and not all scripts support it.


* Use the CloudLinux Governor or not?
Use this if you want to limit mysql more than per user connection count. It is beneficial in shared hosting when you have a lot of different users on the same system.

* EA-php or ALT-php?
If you have cloudlinux there is no harm in having both.  ALT-php allows the cloudlinux select php version. Ea-php will be added by cpanel by default. This allows multi php selection in cpanel. 

* mod_lsapi or mod_ruid2?
 Is mod_lsapi working with EA-php, or do I need to completely drop EA-php in favour of ALT-php (I don't want 
mod_lsapi is available with cloudlinux. This is the best way to run php. If you use cloudlinux use lsapi.
 

* If not CloudLinux, how can you enforce userland CPU/RAM limits and be confident that the user doesn't escapes his homedir?

With out cloudlinux it is more difficult to limit by CPU and ram. For mysql you can limit max connections per username - but not disk io. You might be able to use cgroups to limit with out it. For escaping homedir you would need to use proper permissions and settings in the webserver to only follow symlinks if the owner matches (which may have a performance impact) - or with php suhosin + openbasedir (which has a performance impact for sure).

We were sorry to hear you would like to discontinue using our services.  


Please allow us to clarify that as a web host we take care of the security on the server level, we set up firewalls, security rules, we create our own custom patches for known application issues even before the actual application developers release their official patches, and much more. We have explained how we protect our clients' accounts in this article: [https://www.siteground.com/kb/how\_does\_siteground\_protect\_my\_website/](https://www.siteground.com/kb/how_does_siteground_protect_my_website/)  
Still, a big part of the security of the website depends on the website owner as they have to make sure they use strong passwords and follow best practices in managing applications hosted on the account. When suspicious files are detected on a client’s account, we inform the client about them and we give them the option to remove the infected files on their own or use a third-party service.  Please note that cleaning up of files is outside the scope of our hosting service and in case our customers do not have the expertise to do that we recommend a provider that specializes in this field.  


Regarding your case we would like to review the communication with our team on the problem your reported and make sure all our procedures were followed accordingly. You can send us ticket, chat IDs and further details associated with your hosting account to reviews at siteground dot com.

---------------------------------.    
While I was hoping to save some of this for the official RFO [Reason For Outage] - enough people are getting tremendously upset over this that I'm going to spell out what I can now - keeping in mind that I will provide more details when I can.

**What happened?**

First and foremost - this failure is not something that we planned on or expected.  A server administrator, the most experienced administrator we have, made a big mistake.  During some routine maintenance where they were supposed to perform a _file system trim_ they mistakenly performed a _block discard_.

**What does this mean?**

The server administrator essentially told our storage platform to drop all data rather than simply dropping data that had been marked as _deleted_ by our servers.

**Why is restoration taking so long?**

Initially we believed that only the primary operating system partition of the servers was damaged - so we worked to bring new machines online to connect to our storage to bring accounts back online.  Had our initial belief been correct - we'd have been back online in a few hours at most.

As it turns out our local data was corrupted beyond repair - to the point that we could not even mount the file systems to attempt data recovery.

Normally we would rely on snapshots in our storage platform - simply mounting a snapshot from prior to the incident and booting servers back up.  It would have taken minutes - if maybe an hour.  We are not sure as of yet, and will need to investigate, but snapshots were disabled.  I wish I could tell you why - and I wish I knew why - but we don't know yet and will have to look into it.

We are working to restore cPanel backups from our off-site backup server in Phoenix Arizona.  While you would think the distance and connectivity was the issue - the real issue is the amount of I/O that backup server has available to it.  While it is a robust server with 24 drives - it can only read so much data so fast.  As these are high capacity spinning drives - they have limits on speed.

Our disaster recovery server is our **last resort** to restore client data and, as it stands, is the _only_ copy we have remaining of all client data - except that which has already been restored which is back to being stored in triplicate.

**What will you do to prevent this in the future?**

We have, as we've been working on this and running into issues getting things back online quickly, discussing what changes we need to make to ensure that this both doesn't happen again as well as that we can restore quicker in the future should the need arise.  I will go into more detail about this once we are back online.

**We are sorry - we don't want you to be offline any more than you do.**

Personally I'm not going to be getting any sleep until every customer affected by this is back online.  I wish I could snap my fingers and have everybody back online or that I could go into the past and make a couple of _minor_ changes that would have prevented this.  I do wish, now that this has happened, that there was a quick and easy solution.

I understand you're upset / mad / angry / frustrated.  Believe me - I am sitting here listening to each and every one of you about how upset you are - I know you're upset and I am sorry.  We're human - and we make mistakes.  In this case **thankfully** we do have a last resort disaster recovery that we can pull data from.  There are _many_ providers that, having faced this many failures - a perfect storm so to speak - would have simply lost your data entirely.

This is the **first** major outage we've had in over a decade and while this is definitely major - our servers are online and we are actively working as quickly as possible to get all accounts restored and back online.  For clarity - the bottleneck here is not a staffing issue.  We evaluated numerous options to speed up the process and unfortunately short of copying the data off to faster disks - which we did try - there's nothing we can do to speed this up.  The process of copying the data off to faster disks was going to take just as long, if not longer, than the restoration process is taking on it's own.

Once everybody is back online - and there are accounts coming online every minute - we will be performing a complete post-mortem on this and will be writing a clear and transparent Reason For Outage [RFO] which we will be making available to all clients.

I hope that you understand that while this restoration process is ongoing there really isn't much to report beyond, ""Accounts are still being restored as quickly as possible.""  I wish there was some interesting update I could provide you like, ""Suddenly things have sped up 100x!"" but that's not the case.

I am personally doing my best to reach out to clients that have opened tickets are updated as to when their accounts are in the active restoration queue.  While we do have thousands of accounts to restore - our disaster recovery system actually transfers data substantially faster with fewer simultaneous transfers.  While it sounds counter-intuitive - we're actively watching the restoration processes and balancing the number of accounts being restored at once against the performance of the disaster recovery system to get as many people back online as quickly as possible.

Most sites are coming back online after restoration without issues, however, if once your account is restored you are still having issues - we are here to help.  While we are quite overwhelmed by tickets like, ""WHY IS THIS NOT UP YET!?!?!""  ""WHY ARE YOU DOWN SO LONG!?!??!!""  ""FIX THIS NOWWWW!"" - we are still trying to wade through all of that to help those that have come back online and are having issues - as few and far between as it has been.

If you have any questions - we will definitely answer them - but please understand that while we're restoring accounts we're really trying to focus on the restoration of services as well as resolving issues for those that are already resolved.

Again - I am sorry for the trouble this is causing you - we definitely don't want you offline any more than you do and will have all services restored as quickly as we can.",1537618773.0

“We are working to bring online the servers that host all clients.  This is primarily a function of provisioning the guests on the hosts and configuring them to be ready to accept accounts.  Once this is done we will be conducing cPanel restorations to the servers of just the cPanel and MySQL data and re-connecting the accounts to the home directory data from before the outage.

We do have current and up-to-date MySQL data from before the outage, however, we're going to be restoring MySQL data from our backups taken last night and then will be working to restore any MySQL data lost between then and the outage with clients on a one-on-one basis as needed.

We hope to have everything back online tonight, however, we will keep you updated as we progress with the disaster recovery.

Once we are fully back online we will be providing a complete Reason For Outage [RFO] to all affected clients.  This RFO will outline what happened, why it happened, what we're changing to prevent it from happening again, and what we're changing so that should anything like this happen again we can recover from it substantially faster.

Our goal is always to be as open and transparent as we can be - and we will continue this.  Right now we're focused on restoring services and will provide more details once services are back online.”",1537576374.0

,"Just for reference, those of you on MDD are looking at a minimum of \~7-300 more hours of downtime, depending on which system you're on. They are not restoring systems congruently, but instead one at a time. They're also not restoring all of the accounts at once, and letting users who do have their own backups restore them at their own pace (key, in an event like this).

They're now just beginning to restore users on S1 which'll theoretically take 6.4 hours, presuming they've got a gigabit connection between systems (though I've read that they upgraded the backup system to 10 gigabit).

These are not stones I'm throwing: Don't misunderstand. Amazon has blown things up. Gitlab has blown things up. DigitalOcean's storage went apeshit for 2 days. Bad things happen to great companies.. I don't doubt that further systems will restore faster, but the method they're using is sort of odd: They're copying the backups over to ssd, & then restoring off of those.... one at a time.  The copy to the ssd took \~5 hours, and now will take an additional 6.4 hours to restore, theoretically. I hope, hope, hope that those SSDs are in raid1, if not 10, at the very least, as this is the only copy of the backups that remain. Any error in that copy process results in data loss.

Still, they'll then take \~5-7 hours to copy S2's data to SSD, \~6 hours to restore from it, and then move onto the next system... with 20TB in total, that's going to take a bit. The good news is this is one of those once-a-decade events that don't reoccur for awhile.

I feel for them, as they're fighting bottlenecks, but they also need to immediately a) generate \*all\* accounts for their clients (a \~5 minute process) so they can restore their own data, not piece-meal and by request only & b) start restoring systems congruently. At 43 hours past, even on the slowest of drives, they should theoretically have two terabytes of client data restored: Not zero.",1537719862.0

It looks like our luck is against us.  The damage to the servers was more extensive than we believed originally.  We have the servers in a state of being ready to restore client data and when we attempted to mount the current data - the data can't be mounted / isn't workable.

We still have an administrator working on recovering this local data, however, it is looking like we're going to have to restore all client data from our latest backups.  We're not any more happy about this than any of our clients.  At this point it looks like it could take up to 30 or 40 hours to restore this data.

Once everything is back online we are going to be doing a complete overhaul on our backup system so that a full restore such as this will take only 4 to 6 hours.  There are some bottlenecks in our current backup system that are going to keep things from going quickly.  We could make some changes to the system now in an attempt to speed things up but as the backups we have now are the last remaining copy of the data we aren't going to be taking any chances.

Ballparking things, but I suspect at least another 20 hours of downtime.

So the technical answer is 'Cloud' hosting will scale. Shared Hosting will not. Technically you want a 'cloud' set up. 

The practical answer is do you have anything worth scaling? 

Your question is a bit like saying. I am going to create eBay. What set up would I need to run eBay. You would need to a complicated server set up to run eBay but let's be honest... you probably not going to create the next eBay. :)

You might not spend much more money now on a low-resource Cloud server but you will spend *a lot* of time now (especially if you don't know what you are doing) to get the site set using a VPS or dedicated host up to scale up in future but if the traffic never comes that is a waste of time/energy. 

There is a great blog post about scaling up stuff on the fly at [stephenmann.io](https://stephenmann.io/post/whats-in-a-production-web-application/)

Practically speaking I would suggest kicking off a project like this on a decent shared host with PCI compliance, if it takes off then invest that time to upgrade to a Cloudplatform.

A better idea would be to set up a small cheap desktop machine at a distant family member's house or trusted friend. Then you can install Linux and use rsnapshot or a similar tool to create incremental backups which you can store indefinitely. This would be the cheapest and probably the most secure solution.

To reduce the risk of loss of data, use more than one server, each in a different home or region (to avoid loss due to fire or other natural disasters). Each server should have a RAID-1 or RAID-Z configuration with at least 2 or 3 disks. 

rsnapshot is probably the best and easiest choice for software.

quasides,"dude i know where youre comming from

the situation is just something we can cry about. im currently evaluating both solutions for my future solution.

i even needed to make a feature comparison of a list of needed or wanted basic functions (and iam not talking provisioning here, just basic invoicing and management stuff) to compare each 2.

&#x200B;

to my suprise, both have major (and i mean real major) flaws but on different sectors. both have real good stuff again on different sectors.

hoenstly seeing both for years doing this shit to their customers i really would like to rewrite that whole thing.

as for blesta and freinds, forget it. those are not even close to anything. also i would not listen to much to the average whmcs customer.

 they seem to attract - well how say this the most friendly way - not very professional or expierience people. (i could rage for hours about their community seriously wtf) 

&#x200B;

also it strongly depends where youre located. if youre in europe than youre really in a bit of trouble as both solutions work poorly with european regulations and laws. they slowly getting there regardless that hostbill is polish and whmcs is british company.

both are not 100% suiteable for the euromarket both are not 100% suited for any seriousy business even tough host bill is way better suited from the start.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now to start with the softwarebase:

both are horrible. rumor has it whmcs got better after they got sold to cpanel. 

hostbill (rumar has it they started with stolen whmcs code which would explain a thing or two) but in any case copys many aspects (including major idioticy) from whmcs

&#x200B;

however at least whmcs is well ducoments to write your own extensions, hack little functions in, and in theory a rich ecosystem of extensions.

BUT in reality the biggest part of addons is either useless or badly made. often fade out of support and simply wont work at a whmcs and or php upgrade and you loose functionality. so yea better freelance that things out.

&#x200B;

hostbill on the other hand charges 1000$ only for the dev kit so you can do your own extensions. but rumor has it they are so badly documented that its almost useless.

&#x200B;

hostbills modules seem to be more solid - however they really lack very basic functionality.

also with hostbill you wont get any proper ducomentation (whats there is not that bad but is lacking often major stuff) 

&#x200B;

here are some of my findings of even basic stuff:

quanitites\_ hostbill doing fine - whmcs dont even know those wtf. invoices without proper quanitys are not really professional.

creditinvoice - hostbill doing fine - whmcs dont even know that. needs an addon for that.

vat numebr check - hostbill doing it more or less would need much more work - whmcs dont even knows it

billable items - hostbill doing perfect - whmcs doing it well ludicrous (multi  quanitites alawys adds hours to the text needs manual change)

credits - both are ludicrous while hostbill can do more with that (like jsut reciets isntead of invoices to upload funds) both handel it in a very bad and insane way.

basically both (hostbill does it more) expect that a credit is kinda already sold product and will simpyl deduct it from the total. which also means you have to pay taxes the moment you recieve them. this is bad because you have no writeoffs yet as the customer dont order anything.

thats not only a bookeeping nightmare (and dotn get me started on the VAT problem in that topic) but if you sell stuff with lower margin (like premium ssl or similar) you basically better deactivate credits comepltly. 

all in all credits are broken in both

&#x200B;

transactions - hostbill doing fine but while you can add something to credits only the client can pay something with that. again broken credit system.

whmcs trasnaction list is insane. the client balance will grow forever. its not a reall balance. its broken period.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

products - hostbill offers here its strongest point. with fields and stuff you can do stuff whmcs can only dream of. even with addons you wont come close.

whmcs - on the other hand offers at least a little thing - manual provisioning which can create tikets. hostbill cant really do this.

it can only create a ticket at orderin but the comster gets that tiket too. so for manual tasks whmcs beats hostbill

at automation hostbill wins again - many little features and / product individual configureable options whmcs can only dream about.

question is do you need it.

&#x200B;

documents (invoices and stuff). both suck badly. cant tell who is worse.

funiest part is hostbill documentation how to create multiple pages leaves me qiht a lot of questions:

\-why does neither offer a default template that can print 2 pages? really nobody ever has 2 pages invoices?

\-why does hostbill not say a word that you need to in addition to the tags in the documention enable some settigns in the mphp module or header will overlay? 

&#x200B;

and here is a big point. hostbill is underducomentated but even worse has no community.

there is ZERO information out there. their only (unofficial) forum is deserted like none other. noone provides tips or workarounds.

even tough whmcs has all that the workarounds are often well .nogos. but still at least you have a starting point.

&#x200B;

on the other hand whmcs ignores basic features for years now - hostbill doesnt but they only often implement em lazy.

also they break functions with every update and maybe fix em later (or they dont). whmcs at least dont do that however they often fasde out modules without annoucement or replacement and they simply stop working. 

&#x200B;

bottom line - i dont fucking know either.

both cant handle basic stuff fully well (but hostbill wins here) 

but its hard to have trust in hostbill or its future. it really is. at least whmcs makes the apearance you can have hope for better times.

(even tough they never seem to come) while hostbill seems to run into a more and more compalx and badly broken codebase that seemingly already became borderline maintainable. 

&#x200B;

then again whmcs ignores basic stuff much more than hostbill.

&#x200B;

oh btw sourceway announced a whmcs competitor to be released soon with an open codebase. its a german company so you can have great hopes that at least their basic stuff is solid as no german invoicing software is as bad in their basics as those 2.

however they are not reachable by phone and react superslow by mail so dunno. but small hope there is :))

because they focus so badly on new features to attract their seemingly target audience summerhosts 

it will still takes years until their core is on a proper level. 

&#x200B;

long term im afraid both wont go anywhere. both need to totally rewrite their software to get on a proper modern level

with you know modular abstraction, no smarty templates and similar.

but that would be nessesary to have a stable 3rd party module support, fast upgrades and function and stability

biggest pros for whmcs is the prettier admin aerea (well you can retheme hostbills put a bit lipstick on a pig)

and a bit better integration into 3rd party cms.

You're trying to pick a domain name, worry about the domain name. Social media usernames are secondary items and it's quite common for them not to match the domain entirely.

As for the domain itself, pick something that is available. If your name has two Ms, put two Ms. When was the last time you typed a domain in from memory that wasn't a hugely popular like reddit, google, etc.? It's rare that people type domains these days. You *might* get someone typing it in with one M instead of two... if you're super concerned about it buy the typo and redirect it to the correct one. 99% of the time someone is going to be clicking on something to get to your site - it's more important IMO that your domain match your actual name than it is to misspell your name so a handful of people can type it in correctly from memory.

r0ck0,"> and they are paying FAR too much for it. $300 a year. For a market website. that $300 doesn't even cover help

Depends on your definition of ""help"".  

If they do maintenance stuff like:

* removing wordpress malware 
* making sure email forms are delivering email
* wordpress/plugin updates
* versioned remote backups
* point-in-time restores - pretty important when wordpress plugin update break shit, as they do regularly
* uptime monitoring - not just pinging the server or checking httpd is running, but testing the wordpress installation hasn't broken, i.e. checking a certain string of text is on the homepage etc (""Keyword"" check type on uptimerobot)
* managing domains/DNS, and by extension MX/SPF records... even if you aren't handling their email hosting

...and stuff like that. i.e. things the client might not actually be requesting, but not included with cheap shared hosting (they'll just cut you off if your site gets malware)... then $300/year isn't expensive.  

Are you or the webhost going to do all this kind of stuff within your hosting rates?  

Malware removal can chew up a lot of time.  Sometimes it gets more complicated than just restoring a backup and running updates.  Sometimes you need to edit the php code.

I charge clients $250AUD/year to host, which includes this all this kind kind of stuff.  But obviously not content changes and stuff like that requested by the client.  And $250/year is much cheaper than they'd be paying for shared hosting + me doing handling the maintenance stuff for them on 3rd party servers (that's basically what I charge for 2 hours labour).

I mainly host on my own VPSes because it just saves time having everything consistently in place and with scripting etc, rather than keeping track and monitoring a bunch of different 3rd party cpanel hosts, running different versions of software (different to each other, and different to what I'm developing the site on).  Some don't even have rsync installed or proper SSH access.  All that shit chews up way more time than just setting up & running my own consistent VPSes.

Not saying you shouldn't do or move the hosting... just make sure you're aware of the fact that this is going to chew up your time to both move and maintain it.  Sounds like you could be selling yourself short if you think $300/year is ripping them off to take care of all this stuff.

What kind of ""help"" did you mean exactly?

r0ck0,"Here's my tips, making a few assumptions:

* If you don't know (or have interest in learning) Linux / command line, I'd just stick to cpanel, or shared hosting.  I don't even like cpanel and don't run it on my servers, but I think it's still the best option for non-linux-sysadmins.
* vestacp was mentioned, it's... ok.  I use it on my servers that just host typical basic wordpress sites.  The control panel is very basic, and annoying to use, I just use its command line to create accounts / sites.  It's a bit of a middle ground for people that know a bit about linux, but still want a GUI for some stuff.  I put a big client on a vestacp server a while ago, and it just became a pain, because they weren't familiar with it, but most low-skill webdevs already know cpanel.  I really only use vestacp because it handles the user separation stuff for apache/php processes for me... not so much for the control panel itself.   
* overall cpanel is a lot like wordpress... yeah there's lots of stuff to bitch about them when you're used to more advanced/custom stuff... but they're still the most sensible options for a lot of mainstream small websites.  custom built projects and typical wordpress hosting are very different things, and I never host them on the same types servers.
* I'd just manage all DNS on cloudflare, even if you don't actually use them as a CDN/proxy at all.  Completely free.  In general never really makes sense to do DNS hosting on your own servers unless you're doing something highly advanced like auto-generating zonefiles, and even then using an API is probably a better idea in most cases.
* If you do use cloudflare to proxy, they completely handle https for you for free.  Letsencrypt is great, and I might use it for something one day, but seeing all my sites run through cloudflare, I've never even needed to bother looking into it.
* I had been running mail servers since the fun of having to configure sendmail.cf in 90s.  But since the last 5 or so years or so, I highly recommend you don't try hosting your own email servers (I don't do it any more either), it's a huge pain in the ass to support, and spam reputation stuff is too hard to do on your own now.  Just use office365, google or something cheap if it's not an important thing.  Free email hosting with websites isn't really expected as much these days (from direct non-tech clients).  I don't touch email hosting at all myself any more, aside from hourly billing to assist with office365 etc.
* I've been 100% nginx for all my custom projects in the last 10 years or so, but if you're just hosting wordpress (and maybe other CMSes)... it's easier to just stick to apache because some sites might need to use .htaccess files (not supported by nginx at all).

Lemme know if you have any questions.  Been doing webdev + hosting for about 20 years.  Tried various ways of changing how I do things over the years, some were good, and some were a waste of time, so I might have some learned lessons you can avoid.

Some questions that will make it much easier to give some advice.  Running your own servers could end up costing you more in time depending on all this, i.e. giving you less time to earn money more efficiently overall.

1. What is your actual main everyday job?  I'm guessing the hosting part isn't the main thing you do (i.e. the majority of your income)?

2. Linux sysadmin skill level?  

3. What sort of projects are you hosting?  Typical wordpress stuff?  Or custom built projects?  Programming languages & database engines?

I have not found cpanel to have enough security and stability.

Now that VestaCp allows connection to the softaculous library, I just don't think I will ever really consider another php based control panel.. Someday I hope that ajenti becomes a viable option for python and node.js applications. I haven't really tried to get python pie node.js to work in my VestaCp environments. I had it working once upon a time but I didn't save the script that I had created through Google-fu.

I just think that you have your option between
A) a crappy insecure platform where the developers actually had the audacity to fork apache, the web server.
B) use VestaCp where you can seamlessly use a gui to configure a website for apache or nginx.

I just don't care for apache as much as I love nginx. I know there is a huge amount of resources available for apache. I just think that nginx is. Better web server.

And I think that some crackpots that forked apache, I'd just never ever in my life put up with someone who tries to fork a very complicated piece of software, but especially because cpanel only allows apache?

Not just no to cpanel but hell no!

VestaCp just works at least it works perfectly for me on centos.
 I had previously used Ubuntu with VestaCp but that combination just doesn't seem like it is stable. About six months ago, digital Ocean killed my webserver using Ubuntu and I just don't LIKE it when a web hosting platform goes to war with their users. Ubuntu on VestaCp just doesn't seem like it works.. Or at least that was my diagnosis maybe in January of 2018.

And godaddy is stuck on cpanel.. But when you use godaddy for hosting WordPress, I just never have acceptable performance out of godaddy. And my environments where I have tested cpanel, I just always had attacks that would bring down the servers.

I just don't care and I think of apache as a substandard web server. Cpanel just doesn't seem fast enough, stable enough or secure enough to withstand the test of time.

I'm sure that someday I'll take another look at cpanel. Maybe when I get more budget I'll setup a larger vps somewhere and play with their fork of apache. I mean who the fuck authorized them to fork apache?

I just don't think that apache is competitive with what nginx can do.

Maybe someone can prove to me that apache is superior. I'd require a benchmark where a fully loaded WordPress website in apache could. Render a page consistently in 17 milleseconds. When I started seeing that strong of performance in nginx I just gave up on apache. ",1537176270.0

Before addressing your question directly, we feel obliged to say that everyone who posted a comment under this thread gave wonderful advice. If we understand correctly, your situation is as follows:

 \- Your domain is not registered through SiteGround but you are using SiteGround name servers - this only means that you are renewing the domain and changing the name servers with your registrar.

 \- You are not using SiteGround MX records - the MX records determine where all mail sent to your domain will be delivered. In your case - this is your Exchange server.

 \- You want to host your WordPress application with SiteGround and have your website resolve from our server. However, you want to send messages via your contact forms using your Exchange server.

This would be a good place to state that if you are not using SiteGround MX records, the email exchange settings will be set to Remote for your domain. Meaning, your emails will be managed by a 3rd party - your Exchange server.

In this case, your messages will require proper authentication, and the use of an SMTP plugin is recommended.

As we cannot locate your account we are not able to help further with this issue directly via this thread. Instead we recommend, if you haven't done it already, to post a Support Ticket from your SiteGround User Area. Our Technical Support team will check the configuration (please provide them with a detailed explanation of the situation) and will suggest advice on how to proceed.

**Shared Hosting** is really what you're looking for. VPS (Virtual Private Servers) are fast, they generally come with more than enough resources for what you need but you do need a little bit of background knowledge to get them humming along nicely. With shared hosting you'll get a control panel that'll likely let you install WordPress with a single click. Handy if you're not familiar with Databases etc.

&#x200B;

**WordPress** is a good choice for a blog and could quite easily run your static front page. There are plenty of upsides to it and some down. Up, you get an easy to install, easy to maintain well documented blogging platform with thousands of free templates out there that could be a good choice for your business. Whilst this isn't so much a downside as it is good practice, you do need to keep on top of WordPress security updates. Because of its popularity, holes in security are found and exploited pretty quick.

&#x200B;

If you really want to give making your own site a shot, and I think you should if you like the idea of it and realise the potential up's and down's, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) are great frameworks that will help you get started.

boot_strap_,"These are some of the most common downsides that I have come across:

* **Too many users crammed into one server :** Gives rise to a lot of nasty problems, For example if one user on the server is being DDoS'd everyone on the server will be affected.
* **Email Blacklisting :** Although multiple proxies are used to send emails it is easy to be blacklisted because some users account is sending spam because of a compromised  email account which bring me to the next point.
* **Emails not being sent because of a full queue :** Outbound Emails will be delayed by hours if not minutes if a another user on the server is sending spam.
* **No control over server side software :** If the CMS that you are using requires a certain php version or MySQL version that your host has not introduced yet You'd be helpless till they release it. On the other side updating server side software is just a few commands away.
* **Misleading advertisement regarding plan features :** For example most shared hosts advertise Unlimited disk usage, Email accounts etc but have a cap on the file count.
* **Performance/Connectivity issues :** Most shared hosts advertise unlimited bandwidth but as soon as you have have a lot of users visiting your website will be greeting them with a 502 Bad Gateway error (Server failed to respond because it took too many hits). The same thing happens when they advertise unlimited website hosting - As soon as you have 5+ non static websites (Especially WordPress) you will notice a significant drop in performance.
* **Unnecessary addons :** Shared hosts take advantage of new users who have no idea about hosting by up selling unnecessary addons like Dedicated IP's for SSL, Partner products for Security, Email marketing, SEO etc.
* **Unprofessional way of handling TOS Violations :** If one website is affected with malware or taking too many hits because of a traffic spike   the entire account is disabled (All the domains, Email services) instead of disabling or quarantining the website - If you are running a e-commerce website or your business highly relies on the website/email services  you will loose a considerate amount of money. There are also cases where the entire account is locked down and you do not have access to the domain section as well - Also a great reminder why you should not register a domain with your hosting company.

JessesDog,"As an ex-engineer of a company that had shared hosting as part of their products, these are the problems I hated about them:

&#x200B;

1. All SSL certificates required a dedicated IP address on their servers because SNI was not enabled by default on the Windows servers. The Linux ones did have support, but the way the control panel was built, it DEMANDED a dedicated IP address in order to assign the SSL certificate to the website, which it would then deploy automatically.
2. Limited in versions of PHP. We didn't even add PHP 7.0 support on Windows machines, but the Linux guy did anyway.
3. Wordpress E-commerce sites. Don't get me started. And WordFence, even worse. Hundreds of WP sites using that plugin would just bring the server to a grinding halt sometimes.
4. The system was rumoured to be designed so that all shared servers were evenly balanced when a new website's environment was created. This was false, it just picked any random server, regardless of load balance. One server would have a thousand sites where another would have only 200.
5. When the Windows guy decided to add PHP7 support, instead of putting the servers into maintenance mode and installing it on all servers, he just spins up a new server with PHP7. Out of say, 20 shared Windows servers, only 1 had PHP 7 support. And any customer who wanted PHP 7 but wanted to stay on Windows (for some reason), they had to be migrated manually. Luckily it was just the website files they had to transfer. Databases were on separate servers.
6. The Windows servers never supported htaccess files, so rewrites had to be done via web.config. A lot of customers don't know the difference of Windows and Linux, and just chose Windows because it was a familiar operating system name. The tickets about these problems, and explaining they'd be better off on a Linux server which had native support, and explaining it was a little cheaper too, they kick off about ""So you charged us too much for a simple Wordpress site?!"". I didn't, love. Billing did.

daedalus_dance,"Ideally, you don't want to try and run clustering over two separate networks for a lot of reasons, including issues with NTP (that blasted UDP on port 123 that everyone forgets about but is actually hilariously important for virtualization etcetera). But, basically, if the latency between the two datacentres develops a problem for some reason, your timing in the clustering can become well... a clusterf\*\*4. Lots of stuff can be very time sensitive in virtualization, lots of services in KVM don't like it. [**Time keeping errors can invalidate entire sessions!!!!

Do not under-estimate the timekeeping issue!!!**](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/virtualization/chap-virtualization-kvm_guest_timing_management)

Bandwidth and stuff is the other issue, but NTP issues will be the ones that will eat you in what you're suggesting. It's not a definite, I know of DCs that have direct fibre between two locations *in one country* and that can seriously drop the latency issues and can be viable, but you'll need to discuss with your DC *what exactly* you're trying to do.

As a single server, you sync time to an external source, the VMs slave to the host machine and the VMs and the host don't go out of sync, although the host may lose sync between the external time server and itself . Your set up you're talking about two hosts coordinating across seperate networks - they will need to sync time very closely. It is a bad idea.

You may want to ask this in /r/sysadmin or something though as its actually more an architecture question.  


Edit: Saying this, the services running on two VMs in two **seperate** VM clusters can be ran redundantly and be perfectly fine with lots of options (DNS failover being the easiest, but not necessarily best).

yc01,"Video hosting is not just about the server and CDN even though those are critical of course. You also have to think about how the videos will be streamed back to the client. Streaming a raw MP4 is generally not a good idea unless you are talking about a very small app. The reason is that to stream an MP4 directly, browsers have to download the entire MP4 first which means unnecessary bandwidth that is needed. Yes there is also something called ""progresssive download"" etc but wht I am getting at is that you ideally need to stream using technology such as HLS or Dash. If you have never heard of them, I suggest you read up and get more ideas. 

Ideally, the process will be as follows:

1. Upload the raw MP4 video on the server.  
2. Encode/Process the raw MP4 to generate HLS or Dash segments (for HLS for example, a .m3u8 file is generated with segments defined in a manifest rile)
3. Stream the HLS/Dash segments back to the client using a video player (videojs or premium like flowplayer etc). 
4. Slap a CDN infront of the streaming segments if needed.

Generating the HLS segments is not a trivial task even though there are open source tools lke FFMPEG or Google Shaka Player that can do the job. The issue will be the CPU processing needed to perform this task and if you get a lot of traffic, you will have to build things like queues to process the encoding. Big task. Just for the encoding part though, you could use a paid API like zencoder or even Amazon's Elastic Transcoder API or a service I really like called mux.com (No affiliations with any but love their easy to use API). 

Of course, you can just choose the stream the raw MP4 and you don't have to do the encoding/HLS/Dash creation but that is not how ""real"" video ppl do it.

All you need is to pick a good hosting provider and create a private point to point VPN connection. You can do this over any internet connection and you absolutely do not need a private fiber line. The only reason you need fiber is if you need high capacity for your files. You don't mention but how large are the files that the machine needs to access?

No, as long as you are comfortable keeping Internet facing equipment patches and properly configured.

>but my boss still wants the first solution to be feasible for a year or two (and wants it to be able to handle thousands of concurrent visitors

That really depends on your website framework and the network connection to the office.

>Second: how big of an issue is a dynamic-ip address? Is there anyway around it?

yes there are ways to get around this. The simplest is to get a static IP however. Fewer moving parts. Get a business connection from the ISP and they can provide a static IP. Costs more but you trade that money for trying to work around how DNS operates.

>Third: what other pitfalls are there that I didn't consider?

Power. Redundant Internet connections. Fire. Lots of things can be mitigated by companies already setup to address these things.

Your big issue is the local machine and it only being able to read from the local subnet. Divorce the machine from your website for a moment and think of how it would look at scale. Your website generates orders that get dispatched to whatever is going to be doing the packaging. How? You have a bus of some sort to pick up the orders from a staging location and deliver them to the machinery. This could be done with files or with database records based on the equipment in use. Look up some of the common message buses available (AWS Simple Queue Service, Azure service Bus, even stand-alone options like MuleSoft ESB). Modern bus architectures guarantee delivery and allow replaying transactions in case of network interruptions.

tl;dr: look at a service bus to move your order files from the weebserver to a staging location for your local equipment.",1536771482.0
quentech,"Is it going to matter if your set up goes out completely for a day or two?

If so, you need redundant everything - machines, power, internet connections - and all the setup, testing, and maintenance that comes along with it.

Or, you could sync files from your hosted app to a local machine. I know which I'd rather take on.

I wouldn't use FTP either. It should be straight forward, but I've always ended up running into issues and regretted it. Whip up a little script or app to HTTP GET the files you need and add in whatever alerting and logging you need for failures.",1536780435.0
WoodsIT,"Configuring and installing a small server on your local network that fetches files via SecureFTP from the back end server is a simple solution.

The pros of this solution are;

1 no internet facing equipment (as the server on the local network connects to the back end server, not the other way round),

2. easily automated using Linux command line Secure FTP program called Lftp (automated as if a new file is created on a backend server folder the software will download it without user intervention),

3. if they are large files Lftp also supports multiple connections (meaning it can make say 5 connections and download a file in 5 parts - ideal for extremely fast downloading and using all or more of the available bandwidth)

4. As the server is only doing one thing it does not need to be a huge machine. I have set this up before using a tiny Raspberry Pi! I wouldn't recommend one of those for a production environment but a small server like a [HP Microserver](https://store.hp.com/us/en/mdp/business-solutions/microservers#!&tab=vao) would do this job very well.

5. If you use a simple Linux operating system like Ubuntu Server LTS once the firewall and automatic updates are configured it would be fairly set and forget.

Bluntly: 300 visits a day isn't a lot of traffic, most cPanel hosts would do - standard shared hosting but get something with ""high-availability"" (basically, if a physical computer fails, the cPanel installs all go over to another one) and you'll be fine. You current host might be slow because their cPanel accounts have high-contention (for example) and a few other things; other hosts might be quicker at the same price range.

The other option (if it is the case) would be to speed up your site internally by removing unneeded plugins and fixing up your theme (or possibly finding a new one). Are you using any cache plugin?

soggyoreo,"GoDaddy is the domain registrar in this relationship. 

GoDaddy may or may not also be the location where the nameservers point to. You  would have to login to GD to find out.

The nameservers point to the party that controls DNS (GoDaddy or HostGator for you). The DNS is where you tell the domain where ultimately to point to for web for various  services based on the domain name. (ie:  vpn.abcdefg.com, www.abcdefg.com, ftp.abcdefg.com, and email through MX records within DNS).

HostGator is a hosting provider. In large part, the primary responsibility for HG is to host the website. Like many providers, they also give you the ability to control DNS (if the nameservers point to them), they have email services they offer (shit stuff like webmail and pop3 accounts), and a myriad other free or pay-to-upgrade services.

Since you are likely using HG for email and you want to transition, you will have to go through a process to migrate data if you do not want to lose anything. I would seek professional assistance from a local MSP doing IT work to help. If that's not an option, I would see how critical it really is to transfer the data. If you really need to do it in-house and have the resources to do it, good luck.

You do not have to go through HG for email. You simply change the MX records to change the flow of data to somewhere else. In your case, that would be Google. In that regard, you will need to setup Google prior to switching the MX records to ensure you don't miss stuff in the transition.

Google is no more secure than HG if you ask me. Others will have a different opinion. What will most impact the email security is your internal password policies, internal security awareness on clicking on shit links and attachments, and your ability to enable multi-factor authentication in the future (or now) to lock that shit down.

The site owner is responsible for making sure all important data is backed up. That applies to personal or business hosting. You can employ a third party (i.e. GoDaddy) to perform this service but you need to be able to monitor the state and have some financial penalty for failure to uphold the contract. You're not going to get any of these through your host.

You may get lucky and be able to find your content [with the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/). That is free at least. If that doesn't suite your purposes then consider if the $50 is worth the cost to recreate your content.

No matter what you choose to do with your content you need to talk (calmly, rationally) to GoDaddy about their failures to notify you. Check your contact to see what the host's responsibilities are. If they are failing to meet the contractual obligations then I would suggest looking for a new host and asking GoDaddy to release you from any current contract.

>I'm also seeing OpenStack being mentioned a lot, sounds a good way to have a bunch of dedicated servers all controlled from one place. But how well would this work for a shared hosting environment and if it's even the right solution.

It wouldn't. OpenStack is for managing resources such as compute, storage, networking etc. This would be at the hypervisor/storage level, not the website level (or guestOS level).

>Currently our shared hosting environment is just a bunch of DirectAdmin and CPanel dedicated servers. All sites use PHP and like a quater of all websites are hooked up with pipelines for deployment. Only employees have access to these servers, no external users with ftp or ssh access.

The best thing would be to consolidate these into a single control panel if possible. How many servers?

You're probably spending 8 bucks at GoDaddy and on linode and CentOS and vestacp you can put dozens of websites and you don't have a 1gb limit anywhere.

And your websites will just run faster, no matter what happens. GoDaddy is never going to be competitive with a VPS that runs on Solid state drives.

GoDaddy just does a BAD job allocating enough resources to shared hosting. The thing that really drives me crazy about GoDaddy is that their OWN website never works because it's running on super slow hosting. Their own website it fails for me like 50 percent of the time I try to login to their site. They just suck at writing webpages and they don't take performance seriously. I would never work on godaddy services because I would struggle and struggle to make a simple WordPress app that can render a simple page in under 2 seconds.

klutch2013,"Hey just so you know, if you're going to have this public facing you need to scrutinize uploaded files to every extent possible. Some examples off the top of my head that I've used with PHP:

1) Rename the file. I usually do this by giving the person a randomly generated confirmation code and renaming the file to that.
2) people can easily just do two extensions like .jpg.exe or something so you need to account for that in your PHP extension check. I personally just never allow file names with extra periods in them. It's an easy way to stop .jpg.exe type stuff from being uploaded. This may have a negative effect on some users who decide to use extra periods but it's better to be safe than sorry.
3) Check the MIME type of the file. This can be circumvented but it's still worth checking along with everything else. You can also limit what MIME types you allow on the server.
4) Put the files somewhere OUTSIDE your websites root. So all your files are located in /www/ right now for your site, you need to move the files outside of /www/.
5) Remove execute permissions for the folder you're storing the files in.
6) Implement reCaptcha with a honey pot field and don't let the bot know that their submission failed if they fill the honey pot field.

A2Host supports WPCLI - they have a good guide for exactly this situation @ https://www.a2hosting.com/blog/wp-cli/

However I have never found a host that will touch the install itself. Actual useful host support basically falls into two parts - problem with the server (someone will fix it as it affects lots of users, they will be aware of the issue before you flag it) or something happened specifically to you (e.g. install compromised) and they can roll back to X backup. Beyond that a host will tell you that you are SOL.  ",1535977640.0
daedalus_dance,"I don't know of such an API (which is a big ask, as you're asking a host to maintain a special publicly accessible service you can plug into from outside their network), but hosts that support [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) would be what you're looking for as it'd make your setup much more automated - you could just trigger a script that installs your plugin set. You could also maintain your own git repo to even more streamline it. If you needed a host with a special one-click function for your setup, you're really talking about your own product and finding a business partner in the hosting sector - *and it sounds to me like you want to outsource the website management anyway; which again, sounds like a service partner.*

It's exactly the sort of automation wp-cli was made for tbh, and lots of developers do use it that way; and some hosts do automate plugin installation in their own offering that way (e.g special cacheing plugins or CDN).

daedalus_dance,"Obviously the web-server isn't configured to listen for that domain. When you type in the domain some-`customer.mydomain.com` it sends a request *with that domain*.  The server then runs a check by going ""Hey, mmm, do you have the domain in the request?"" - if the request doesn't match a domain for some reason, your request will throw up such an error in a shared environment.

So, you're right that your DNS is working, but either your server isn't configured to handle that domain properly *or* it's pointing to the wrong IP and *that strange server* is wondering why you are bothering it.

I'll caveat this by saying I don't use heroku (there's far cheaper ways to host an app than a layer of abstraction on-top of AWS). I do know that when just cloning directly things from local dev using other frameworks if you're not careful your cloned app can take a config to listen on `http://localhost` or something with it - if that's the case, that'd explain your problem.

For example I'm currently developing a site on local where the apache vHost config is just default (It's my local area, it doesn't need anything more) - if I copy that setup directly without setting up a new vHost on the production server with the correct ServerName directive, you'd find the site at [`127.0.0.1`](https://127.0.0.1) (whatever my public IP was at best). At worst, you'd just crash another site that might have been in the default config and you were hosting another site there.

So, i'd suggest you check (with a fine tooth comb) that your clone of the app is *really* listening for the domain and not a local dev area. How that works on Heroku is anyone's guess (I see you also asked in /r/heroku ?). Human error explains a lot of things, we all do it and its probably the biggest waste of our time.

Edit: worse than the apache example, if its an app with the server built in like a nodeJS app with Express, its *very easy* just clone the local config as the local config will be in the app files :)",1535967816.0

Email hosting for custom domains is provided by many different means: 

1. The domain registrar often will offer email forwarding and sometimes a few email accounts (maybe up to 5).  Often it will be at an additional cost.
2. A web host hosting your website will usually offer email for your domain.  Usually included, but sometimes at an additional cost.
3. Various companies will sell email accounts with varying storage and usage limits.  Typical cost $3 to $5/month per account.
4. There are also a few major internet companies who will host your domain email for free.
5. You can self-host your domain's email with Mail-in-a-Box or a similar project.
6. You can rent space from a email reseller.  BUT these companies want you to understand the in's and out's of email as they will not offer low level customer support.

Option 1 is usually a poor choice because it is always advisable to have your domain registration and hosting at different places.  Option 2 defeats your purpose as you are not wanting to run a website, but may still be reasonable to purchase just for email hosting.  Option 3 is most likely where you will end up at your level of knowledge.  Option 4 comes with privacy concerns such as are they scanning your emails for advertising purposes, and the ones I know of are in Russia - nothing wrong with that, but most people prefer their email to be hosted closer to home.  Option 5 is doable and most likely your cheapest option, however again you have already said that you have no experience in these things, so not for you.  Option 6, same.

I would offer suggestions, but frankly am not interested in doing your research.

I will be happy to help you in PM if you have questions about a provider or what they offer.

You buy domain names from a domain name registrar company.  That may not be the same company from which you've bought your web hosting service. Obviously, the name you choose has to be one that's not already owned by someone else.       

Once your website is ready and you've bought a domain name, you go back to the domain name registrar company and point the name to your website.

daedalus_dance,"For what its worth I don't really think its complicated. Running your own email from a cPanel account is four steps, and a good host will have automated it so everything just works.

The process to do it yourself (if available) is pretty simple:

1. Create the Email Addresses on the Email Service, normally through a control panel. **You'd have to do this step with gmail or outlook.**
2. Find your correct MX Records and set them at your DNS  (normally an A Name at DNS like mail.yourdomain.com that points at the server IP). **You'd have to do this step with gmail or outlook.**
3. Enter SPF/SRV and other records (also visible on cPanel) to ensure authentication and stop spam score issues.
4. Set up your mail client with your server details

Most of the issues with spam filtering come about because hosts are lazy about mail, so don't encourage their users to use SSL and port 465 with authentication, and don't enforce anti-spam measures in case it annoys the 0.5% of their customers trying to send loads out in a single day. Certain measures were introduced at DNS level and with encryption to minimize spam, and most email providers expect them to be implemented and raise spam scores if they are not.

Don't use port 25 or port 587 (if you can avoid it), port 25 in particular is a known spam vector. Port 25 should generally never be used and if your host is using it I'd say its certain you'll have reputational issues.

I've also had trouble with customers using gmail ***as their client*** because gmail (just the standard service, anyway) defaults POP3 for downloading of mail. This isn't a problem with gmail, per say - but its the sort of human error you get. Customers not understanding the difference between POP3 and IMAP then complain their emails have gone missing in shared accounts which is more frequent (even for smallest businesses with mam and pap) then you'd realise. If the email is to be accessed by more than one person, I'd recommend you make sure you can use IMAP - and lots of third party clients don't support that as it needs syncing with the mail storage directly ;)

Past that it's really going to be about the features you want and your overall budget. Decent shared hosting can be had for around your budget. A lot of providers, ourselves included, will offer discounts that only last for your first billing cycle, just like SiteGround does, however, most aren't as large of an increase as SG tends to charge.

I_AM_NOT_A_WOMBAT,"> I wont mention the times I had to argue with other hosting staff and felt like I know more than they do. This is unacceptable. 

Unfortunately you're always going to get that. I had a tech at a top-tier host (a representative of which is active here) call me out for marking my ticket ""critical - site down"" (it *was* down at the time I opened the ticket, and I had no idea what the problem was since I couldn't even reach a shell) because when he looked at it the site was working again, followed by intermittent failures throughout the day. I was furious; I didn't appreciate being accused of mis-marking a ticket to get faster support (I absolutely did not do that and I never would), and it was bad enough that my web site kept failing and then I had been re-prioritized. Then later in the day, a different tech said it was a DoS attack (not against me) and they mitigated it. It's been fine ever since. They're still a good host, but you're never going to escape the fact that a random front line tech doesn't know how much experience you have.To get the kind of service you're looking for, you'll probably need to find a host with a small staff that you can get to know personally and build a trust relationship (and have to rebuild it every time they hire someone new). They aren't necessarily more expensive, but with a smaller staff you might have a slower response time.

I don't see any basic webhost, even moving up into a more premium area who is going to offer a ton of support if you get hacked - if you are lucky they will check logs and point out how it happened, and have a backup to restore - and if that happens you must resolve the security issue.

- At a lower rate, I remember that A2 Hosting for example offers a ""Premium Support"" option around $25/mo, in addition to the normal hosting fees.
- Below that, with standard support, my experience is that the only thing they will be able to do for you is restore a backup... and you might get hacked again in the 10 minutes that follow, because your backup just brings back the same vulnerability that got you hacked in the first place.

&#x200B;

Certificate Duration Period: The validity period of a Free SSL Certificate is only 90 days. Whereas Premium SSL Certificate validity period is 825 days; So it's better to invest in premium SSL if you are looking for long-term security at an affordable price.

Price: As described by its name Free SSL Certificate does not cost anything to you. Premium SSL Certificate included some amount, but it also varies from seller to seller.

If the free SSL certificates were appropriate then all the leading e-commerce websites would be using them, right? But they don’t and there are plenty of reasons for it.

Now usually, you would just point the domain to the public IP using either an A record or AAAA record. But since you want to use DDNS, it is not that simple, you would need support from your DNS provider to do that as they would need to update the record to reflect such changes. Unfortunately, according to this [support link](https://www.godaddy.com/community/Managing-Domains/Dynamic-DNS-Updates/td-p/7862) it seems that GoDaddy does not offer this service. 

So you now have two options. 

1. you manually create the record yourself and hope that your public IP does not change too often. There are guides online on how to obtain your public IP and how to create those records. GoDaddy support should be able to help you as well.

2. Go with another provider that supports Dynamic DNS with their domains. A quick [check] (https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/595/11/how-do-i-enable-dynamic-dns-for-a-domain) with my preferred provider Namecheap suggests that do offer this service though I would suggest you contact their support team before you decide to go with them to confirm that article.

Mine had the microSD card fail, would stop responding for no reason prior to reboot and whenever the power was cut, had to ask my parents if they were home to go plug it back in. I know you probably can't afford it right now but when you can, I strongly recommend you buy hosting or heck even a VPS from like Linode or DigitalOcean if you are not afraid of using Linux. You can get a VPS from those guys for 5 dollars a month and do whatever the hell you want. Plus the IPs for those VPSes don't ever change and you won't need DDNS. And if you have not already, I would recommend you check out the [Github Education Pack] (https://education.github.com/pack).

2 -- Both. Set up LE first; then enable Cloudflare and set it to Full. No reason not too

3 -- If you are doing this to learn. Try them all - see what you find easiest to configure vs the speed benefits

4 -- Where are you? Where is your 'audience'. Choose based on that. (Or you can look at status logs and get a feel for what datacentre you think is most stable?)

5 -- Few things to consider. CentOS has a longer release cycle; it also has a much longer support cycle (arguably more stable than Ubuntu). Ubuntu’s Long Term Support releases  are released every two years and have a support life of 5 years. Keep in mind as well Ubuntu is based on Debian vs CentOS which is a clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Personally I have found learning Ubuntu first was useful as you get comfortable with apt-get and other Debian based versions of Linux

CaptainFluffyTail,">Is there a step by step guide which can I can follow?

Vultr has a LEMP installation pre-configured available under ""applications"" for Server Type.

otherwise check Digital Ocean's guides. Example: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-in-ubuntu-16-04

>I will routing the sites via cloudflare. Should i use their flexible SSL or install lets encrypt?

Personally I would want to manage the cert myself and make sure everything in the site is respecting the cert and going HTTPS.

>Which server in US should i choose from Vultr?

Do you mean ""Server Location"", i.e. the data center? Do you know where your traffic will be coming from yet? If so pick the data center closest to that region. If you don't know then pick a city you like, except for Atlanta. Fuck Atlanta.

>Which OS Ubuntu or Cent OS? 

Have you used either before? The big difference is the package management solution (apt vs. rpm). if you're looking for guides then I would suggest Ubuntu since there are more starter guides aimed at that distro. Just remember to understand the command before copy/pasting it.

>32bit should be better since its 512 MB ram?

Secondly, I wouldn't suggest  going to a VPS, it doesn't just require you to know programming, it needs a lot of setup and configuration to be secure enough. Tho I use ramnode for personal private projects and its great ($3.5 month plan). VPS gives you power, and with power comes responsibility.

For you id suggest going with hostinger. In no way would i recommend them for a big project as they have terrible attack protection and a lot of hidden limitations, but for your project I would recommend them. They are also extremely cheap, when i got my plan with them I paid around $6 for 3 months (i think it was black friday), but everytime i visit their site they seem to have cool offers.

1and1 does have a good attack protection, but they have the most terrible support you could ever imagine (unless u live in uk or us, but its still terrible, and they have only phone support).

Maybe as a start you could try a free webhost such as 000webhost, I have seen people do good with them as a start, when you start getting downtimes and more visitors you can move to another host. You can use cloudflare if you feel like it (not sure about 000webhost). You can also park your domain to their servers so you dont have to use their subdomain.

5. Any host/plan should be able to handle that.

CaptainFluffyTail,">i've been on this sub for 4 hours still no idea what host is best for me

This sub isn't just reviews of webhosts. Other forums do that. you are more likely to find people complaining about problems and looking for solutions here. While that can help narrow the field, it doesn't provide your initial set of players to winnow down.

So, let's group your requirements:

>* site for a marketing agency, to be able to have a beautiful ui, and fast page loads

That is independent of the host mostly. Pick a CMS framework and don't overload it with crap. Control the size of the graphics you upload too no matter what CMS. Big graphics bog down any site.

* something with a quick easy wordpress, 1 click install, and i can learn as i go along..drag and drop even better

Most hosting companies that advertise WordPress have a one-click install option. The drag-and-drop is more a function of a pagebuilder plugin within WordPress rather than something from the host. 

>* start with shared hosting until i learn about the other options/build clientele

Good call. You know you need to start someplace and shared hosting is the easiest option.

>* don't need an e-commerce store

Great. Don't install one.

>* cpanel

This is the default for shared hosting. You're good.

>* ability to add on new sites down the road

Very easy. Setup a second domain name on the shared hosting account (through cPanel) and run the one-click install for WordPress (or whatever). Most hosts have this automation to help you. 

>* preferably under 100/yr

Watch the renewal price on SiteGround. It just up on renewal. This isn't hidden, just in a different font than the initial price.

>* good customer service

What is your definition of ""good""? Most hosts will help you with technical problems but not things within your site. That tends to be a different type of support package. Are you counting ""good"" as response time or overall ability to fix issues?

You have a couple of comments about the domain in there which should be separate from your hosting.

>* comes with email and domain name

If/when you decide to move your website to a new host down the road it becomes a lot easier if your registrar and hosting provider are separate. It just gives you more freedom. Check to see if your registrar offers email without having to pay for a separate hosting package.

>* prefer to have whois protection so sick of calls from these indian companies

This is the domain registrar. Most well-known registrars are now offering this for free (even NameChaep). 

There was one comment that seemed out of place.

>* don't need much storage as i use google drive

What do you plan to store in Google Drive to then be shown by the website? How did you plan on that working? Share the items out of your drive and use the share URL in the website? There are better ways to do that which don't involve using your personal GDrive.

Start with your registrar first and get your domain name registered. Then look at hosting providers.",1534592826.0

Any cloud provider.  AWS, DigitalOcean, Vultr, Linode etc.

One setup you can look into which is more advanced is spreading everything out horizontally.  Have a cluster of web servers, a cluster for DB, cluster cache, cluster file hosting (but actually for this probably better to enforce a CDN.)  Management via panel at this level isn't available in public tools to my knowledge so you would also need to setup some config management like Ansible, Puppet, Chef or other.  ",1534450942.0

CaptainFluffyTail,">Drop a better honest windows vps site if you know one

There are few Windows providers out there due to the additional overhead and licensing required. LeaseWeb is one of the few I know of that isn't a major cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCS). Cost is about the same as Vultr. Vultr may be slightly faster on processors currently. LeaseWeb has Server 2012R2 while Vultr has Server 2016. 

You're going to pay a lot more for AWS/Azure/GCS to run the OS than something like Vultr becasue you have more knobs and sliders available. A demo server I setup on Azure was $145 USD/mo. while I could build the same on Vultr for $56 USD/mo. I had fewer options but when you need a box to run Windows becasue you cannot tryst the sales guy to be able to run a VM on their laptop you don't have a lot of options.

>You cant change it or paste it in the password box because both of these things are disabled...so the vps is basically useless after a bunch of installations.

In terms of changing the password...Start->Users (left edge of the start menu)->Sign-in options->Change Password. 

>If you use vultr windows vps can you explain how you manage to log into it?

RDP. I suggest setting up the network firewall in Vultr to only allow RDP from your IP address instead of hanging your ass out on the Internet and waving at everyone passing by.

>Copy and paste is also disabled.

No, it isn't. On the Vultr webpage there is a button to copy the password to help make sure you don't get spaces before or after. That pastes into RDP just fine. once RDP is running you can copy from your desktop to the remote desktop. That is how I stage installs when I need new copies of software.

WordPress will not take care of a switch to nginx for you. The guide you've linked-to doesn't replace Apache with nginx though, it just sits nginx in front of Apache as a reverse proxy. In most cases this will be non-disruptive to WordPress.

Regarding creating a restore point for the server, this is something you'd need to ask your host. Usually this shouldn't be hard to do.

Given your traffic volume, depending on how spread out your visitors are, you may want to consider using a CDN to handle static assets for your site.

Why not just create a staging site using the WordPress toolkit? You can test all of your changes on the staging site and see if it breaks anything. You can install Nginx without enabling it on all of your sites.

Plesk offers a Smart Updates add-on which includes restore points, but it's mainly for WordPress updates. Creating a staging area is the best option to test the changes you want to make.

From a security standpoint you should be concerned about botnets (malicious identities) targeting your dedicated IP address on your new server. You mentioned that all of your applications aren't capable of upgrading past PHP 5.3. PHP 5.3 has been end of life since 2014 and you should really encourage your clients to update their code base. It's a security vulnerability and can potentially lead to information disclosure. 

With that being said a dedicated server is the step in the right direction from a resource usage/performance perspective. You'll no longer be sharing resources between other applications that you're not familiar with. With that being said, you did mention there were approximately 700 websites that you'd be moving over, so I would recommend you keep a close eye on your resources and scale when necessary. 

Additionally, you may consider implementing the use of CloudFlare on all of your websites. This will help mitigate any attacks that come to your server.. You'll certainly fall victim to aggressive brute force attacks if a malicious identity discovers your server solely hosts PHP 5.3 applications.

If you look for any managed solution, it will cost you around $290+ on premium hosts like wpengine and around $90+ on general hosts.

However, if you manage your own server, it will cost around $20/month. There is some learning curve and you'll have to take care of the security and system patches. Or you can use server management websites such as runcloud, cloudways or serverpilot to setup the server for you, which has added costs on top of usual vps prices of digitalocean, vultr, linode or likes but it will take care of the security and server patches for you.

The third route is to hire someone to custom setup your server, optimise the server for your specific website, make sure it secure and properly patched on a regular basis. And it never goes down. And you'll end up paying about $20/month just like you'd usually do if you setup the server yourself. But the bonus is you'll have peace of mind knowing that it is setup correctly and it secure.

WordPress.com is good for beginners and they have a free plan. Only downside of WP.com is their free plan doesn't let you use your own domain and their WordPress is limited. However, it's really easy to work with and offers a great UI.  And if your blog is going to start off low traffic, going with the WP.com free plan is not a bad idea, you can easily promote your blog on social media and other places. Once you get a bigger audience you can always move to self-hosted or upgrade your plan. This is probably the most cost effective solution.

1. If you really want Gmail and you already have a GSuite account, you can add their domain as an alias and create an account for them. As long as their username doesn’t collapse with yours (i.e. they can’t have a generic contact@theirdomain.com if you already have a contact@yourdomain.com). Also they will need to login using the primary domain, not theirs one.

2. Also, still if you want Gmail, you can create a free @gmail.com account, use any free email hosting alternative (such as Zoho free) and redirect all your custom domain emails to your Gmail account. Also you can setup your Gmail to use your custom domain as the ""from"" header ([more info](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?hl=en)). The drawback is there will be a small delay on the received emails.

3. You can look at the options from the companies that register your domains. Namecheap for instance has one for $10/year. I think they use free and open source webmail clients, such as RoundCube, Horde and SquirrelMail (those two last looks really outdated, but RoundCube is quite decent IMHO).

4. Zoho free is good, but there are some serious limitations. It doesn’t even support POP/IMAP. The cheapest plan is good enough and is $2/month.

A large WordPress site for a demanding client can mean a lot of things. Does large mean lots of visitors? Lots of content? Lots of something else? The demanding client, I hope has a budget to match their demands (nothing worse than demanding with no budget).

If the site is only WordPress, I think AWS with their support is a bad solution. Their business support response times also don't match your expectations I think:

>Case Severity and Response Times*

>General guidance: < 24 hours

>System impaired: < 12 hours

>Production system impaired: < 4 hours

>Production system down: < 1 hour

AWS doesn't specialize in WordPress and if you want to use their infrastructure there are multiple companies built on top of AWS that actually do specialize in WordPress or have a business unit that does (CloudWays, Pagely, even GoDaddy/Media Temple are using AWS or are in the process).

SiteGround does work a lot with WordPress and has built some infrastructure around it. They do optimize and have WordPress people. Of your two choices, I would lean towards them, but there are also a lot of other companies specializing in WordPress (probably over 50+ companies now that really focus on WordPress hosting).

As others said 100% uptime is not possible. Some companies offer SLAs about uptime. If you're really concerned, getting a failure resistant hosting setup with redundancies is a good idea. Also is going to cost you, generally looking at an enterprise level plan that could cost hundreds to thousands per month to really make sure your client's site stays available. There are companies that specialize in that [too](https://reviewsignal.com/blog/enterprise-wordpress-hosting-performance-benchmarks-2018/). That link is a comparison of enterprise WordPress hosting companies I performed if that's really the level you need.

My suspicion is you're not at the enterprise level (few are, just playing the odds), you probably have a decent budget in the 100-300/month range based on the AWS+business support. Most of the managed WP providers will have something at that level, figuring out what your other needs are in terms of users/space/bandwidth/location/etc. I've got a big spreadsheet with different plans I've tested this past year https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17OFYPusxDe1_K7F2c85fupikuFHR1BuwXUuVD8U4vJU/edit#gid=590080197 that might be of some help at least filtering down somewhat some candidate companies.

But, specifically, you want to look for a hosting firm that has actual tech support in the United States that can quickly respond and is familiar with Word Press.

I suggest US-based firms because they are more reactive and timely than others.  Just my experience as a consumer, tech-support manager and owner of a hosting firm. 

So, you should find a reputable hosting firm that can hold you hand through the process and can also actually respond to you.  One that you can call and get real support.  If you call the support of some of the larger cloud firms, they won't be able to quickly support your needs because they will tell you that ""our system is up, so that is your problem, not ours.""  Try it by calling them and asking them yourself about their services to Word Press.  You'll quickly see.

On a completely separate note I would also check the WP structure/config you are using and the backend hosting hardware/OS/config.  We've had plenty of WP clients with no downtime for years (except scheduled upgrades) but if you have a client that has had uptime problems you may want to take a peek at the configuration.

You will also find most reputable web hosts will demonstrate their uptime via third party uptime monitors.  If you can't easily see that on their website you may want to ask for it.

I like to tell my clients that the less I hear from them, the better for both of us, and they agree.

If you go the shared hosting route, you'll end up spending more time updating, securing, and managing your site. Shared hosting may seem cheap but what they don't tell you is that the servers are heavily oversold which degrades performance.

Managed hosting on the other hand can be a bit more expensive but offers more features. Typically a managed host will take care of installation, updates, securing, caching, etc.

gridghost_hosting,"Hi,

I am one of the [gridghost.com](https://gridghost.com) developers, our services are targeted and optimised for WordPress hosting.

I agree with Wurpe the question is very general and leaves a lot to be guesstimate, I will try to add to what was said below .

When selecting a WordPress hosting it really depends on the type of website you want to host and there are a few questions you have to answer yourself:

Do I care a lot about security and downtime ? Yes/No ( How much will the business lose if my website is down for 1h or 1 day )

Do I want to get my hands dirty and learn how to configure a shared hosting cPanel or I just want to click one button and be prompted with WP Log-In credentials.

What sort of traffic I have or expect to have on the site. ( This will affect your site if you go for a cheap plan )

It is an eCommerce platform ? so SSL is a must as all the payment integrations require SSL.

Do I want to have automated backups of my site ? Most of the platforms offer automated backups but don't expect the recovery of the site to be as automated as the backup .

This are some general questions hope they will help you deciding what hosting to go for.

If you are after a install and forget solution then [gridghost.com](https://gridghost.com) offers just that. 

\- we take care of everything in the background( security, updates, patches, cashing, backups ) and your site can be easy managed for our dashboard.

\- one click recovery and your site will get back to the last backup.

\- our services start at $5 /  month and you can always upgrade to higher plans if you need too

\- the only thing you will need to worry is designing your website or migrate the existing one with an easy to use plug-in",1533913494.0

Next Step: Chose Key format: PEM Default (""Copy Origin Certificate"" and ""Copy Private Key"" and Web Server for Installation to ""Apache httpd""

Now go to Siteground cPanel > SSL/TLS Manager > Manage SSL Hosts > Scroll right to the bottom > Now select the domain for SSL > Paste the ""Origin Certificate text from CloudFlare into ""Certificate CRT"" and Private Key text in the ""Key"" > Leave the Certificate Authority Bundle as ""BLANK"" > Uncheck the box ""Enable SNI for Mail Services > Click Install > Congratulations you have now successfully installed the CloudFlare certificate for 15 years.

siteground,"Hi CaptainFluffyTails,  


We apologize for the extra trouble in getting to an installation of a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate on your account. Please note that normally this process is automatic and does not require any manual steps on your behalf. We are working on restoring the proper functioning of the Let's Encrypt tool for managing the certificates and remove the hassle for our clients. We will be applying a fix that will create the certificates automatically again. 

It is correct that we were one among the first hosts to integrate Let's Encrypt on our servers and we developed a lot of custom tools to make it easier for our clients to use it. We have seen a very high adoption from our customers on activating Let's Encrypt for their websites and with the big volume of users we have encountered some issues in maintaining the automation to work well in all stages of the life-cycle of the certificate, from creation to renewal.   
Once again we are sorry for the inconvenience caused.

TheNominated,"1. Yes, these are usually called add-on domains or simply websites. The benefit of having them under different accounts is added security: a malicious script on one website won't be able to access and wreck the other sites. The drawback, of course, is that having separate accounts is more expensive.
2. That depends heavily on the hosting company, there's no clear cut rule. Most companies offer a separate Wordpress hosting as a dumbed-down version of normal shared hosting, where much of the work of setting up the Wordpress installation is done for you. Some simply use it as a way to gouge more money out of you, by marketing on the Wordpress keyword. Some offer Wordpress hosting as a fully managed solution, where you get very in-depth support for usually a larger price than normal shared hosting. Again, depends on the company.
3. You usually don't. Years ago, it used to be necessary for SSL certificates, but these days are long gone with SNI. It's mostly a way to isolate your sites from other customers on the same server, so your IP isn't tarnished by their possible malicious activities.

There is no network transfer so you can rule out any network issues, and you're on your own computer which is at worst comparable to a VPS and at best a super powerful dedicated.

Since you use PHP, you can also install [Blackfire.io](https://Blackfire.io) to see any performance bottlenecks.

The first step is to setup a local container/vm.  For this you can do just Virtualbox + CentOS 7 and install/setup PHP, Nginx, MySQL and everything else manually if you know exactly what you want.  If not then you'll probably want to use Vagrant (essentially a helper for Virtualbox) which is configured by [https://puphpet.com/](https://puphpet.com/)

The second option is best if you don't know how to set it up.  Puphpet will create a config that auto-installs everything you select.

So get all of the data and just try to keep restricting resources and keeping it speedy.  If you can't get below 1gb memory and 2 cpu's for speed then you essentially need a VPS.  If you get to below 256mb and 1cpu with practically no CPU usage you're fine on shared.

Bandwith is a terrible metric for determing load.  Some PHP code as simple as while (true) { password\_hash('foobar') } would cause problems on most servers and it doesn't take any bandwith.  Same thing for space in files and database.  The only metrics they provide is bandwith and storage space respectively.  Performance is solely on cpu and memory which are not counted in any of those things.

I would not recommend a VPS if you don't know how to handle one.  You can go with a managed VPS but the prices are higher.  You could go unmanaged and learn along the way if that's the route you wish to take, with the amount of guides and information out today it's pretty hard to go wrong.

However if you just want the site up, shared is the way to go.

\--

To answer the question though, I personally always start with a VPS/Cloud container regardless of site size.  Even though it's still shared, I can at the very least install other services or upgraded versions to make my code as performant as possible to try and offset any neighbor issues.",1533168793.0
calligraphic-io,"If you go the VPS route and are willing to spend the time to learn it, Ubuntu Server is maybe one of the easier to use and better-documented Linux distributions. Installing Webmin on it (and properly securing it) might help a lot by giving you a GUI interface to managing all of the different pieces of your server. I would find third-party DNS and e-mail hosting if you don't have experience with managing those services. Windows Server can also be a good choice if you can afford the license and don't have a lot of experience with server administration. Since you'll be responsible for upgrades and managing configuration (instead of delegating it to a shared host), get in the habit of making backups (or snapshots in VPS lingo) whenever you make changes. Good luck! ",1533166172.0
3e486050b7c75b0a2275,">My question is are there certain benchmarks or criteria that would indicate that VPS is the way to go?

Yes, when your shared hosting provider suspends your account for excessive resource usage or you see the symptoms of this in the form of timeouts or 
extremely slow page loads. That's when you switch to a VPS or dedicated server and not before. Wait for them to boot you out :) 

Basically the more ""shared"" the hosting the lower the price and the higher your profits. However, it also means you have less *dedicated* resources. Dedicated resources are expensive but required when your sites get popular. However, switching to a plan with more dedicated resources prematurely is a waste of money because like I said the more ""shared"" the hosting the cheaper it is.

In terms of how much dedicated resources you get:

dedicated server > VPS > shared hosting (cpanel, da etc.)

That_TonyRobinson,"Hi, it is quite easy to figure out when people need to consider a VPS  by  simply enumerating the major drawbacks of a shared hosting:

\> limited resources

\> less control over the configuration of infrastructures, like PHP configuration

\> unstability and bad response time because of it's shared nature

Thus, the answer is basically that when a share hosting can neither power the site with sufficient resources, nor offer a more stable and faster environment for the doubled traffic.

From a long run, it's definitely a wise decision to learn how to administrate a server as early as you can.

In your case,  I would recommend you start from a basic VPS plan on Linode and Vultr that costs $5/mon, with 1GB RAM, 20GB storage and 1 TB bandwidth, which are more than sufficient for you to run your sites.

Also, a novice-friendly control panel is necessary for you to better understand and learn how to manage a server in the early stage, I would recommend [VPSrobots](https://vpsrobots.com/), mainly because it does not consume your precious server resources, which is important especially in a basic server plan.

Scotty87,"As mentioned in another comment - it's a pretty big ask. I'll briefly try to touch on some important points. Pardon me if I miss some but I think these would be some of the more important

So where do you start?

* Experience

This one is very key. You need a lot of experience. Not just hosting a few websites for friends but actual real industry experience. I'm not sure where you are located but you probably want to look at employment at a local company if possible. In no way would I recommend anyone to ever attempt this without having seen and worked directly with experienced people. A lot of processes, A lot of learning, a lot. I easily say 10+ years would be a fair expectation before anyone should even attempt this ""on their own"".

In reality - there's always a handful of regional hosts that I can tell do this out of their basement so to speak that knows next to nothing and provides matching service.

* Reason

This might sound silly but you need a really good reason. Web hosting is a severely oversaturated market. There is no shortage of companies and if anything - the demand for an ""out of box web host"" is going down. The average user is no longer going fo web hosting only and instead of going with services like wordpress.com, Wix, etc. So just providing hosting is no longer an appeal. If you build/combined your own CMS - that might be appealing but again, even that is becoming quite saturated in options.

The other side of the market are the power users which for the most part already have something like a Digital Ocean setup at a very low cost. You won't be able to grab them away very easily.

I'm sure you can see where I'm going. It will be a continuous uphill battle and without some solid reason/motivation to get into the industry, it likely won't pan out. There is very little ""fun"" in this kind of work IMHO.

* The Business side

So you have experience and a good enough reason. Now you need to figure out how you make it all work. You need to figure out the internals. How are you planning sales, support, etc. Web hosting has almost little to no profit margin because of heavy competition - prices just keep getting lower and lower. How are you going to pay people? Most companies provide free support 24/7. How will you compete, monetize and stay in profit? Just about every company needs to upsell add-on services to make a decent profit.

The more common option to compete against the big brands is usually to offer managed service/hosting for (usually) local companies. At this point you are more a  middle-man and having your own hosting setup may be a good option - many people in this position will usually stick with a reseller package. To be successful here - it's absolutely key to not only have a lot of experience but also be naturally more inclined than average techs so you can provide the proper ""specialty"" service needed. 

* Web Servers

For the more technical side. You will need to decide whether you will be hosting and managing the hardware - like a data center. This is a pretty poor choice but is still done. The other options are essentially using someone else's system to some extent. You have options here.

You could rent a VPS and setup/manage the whole system/OS portion. You could instead go with a reputable hosting company that has a ""Reseller"" plan. This basically allows you to sell accounts directly (as yourself/business) to your customers but using their servers/systems. Many have ""white label"" setup so your customers won't easily know who your parent host is. The Reseller approach is probably the best way to start off since there are very little upfront costs and management is mostly off your hands (parent company usually handles updates, etc).


A lot of these details would make more sense and be more obvious to someone who had directly worked in the industry. This is likely why you may be getting downvoted or not getting helpful comment due to it being one of those ""If you have to ask... you probably shouldn't"". But hopefully, my answer will provide some insight on where you should start.

**TL,DR** It's not fun, There is no money in it. Get experience first so you realize this yourself. This industry only has sys admins losing hair at 3 AM because the server decided to shit itself. There is no glory.",1533061508.0

KH-DanielP,"Howdy,

To answer your questions:

1) Most if not all shared hosting plans will have some sort of restrictions in regards to PHP variables. Be it execution time, session length so on and so forth. 

2) You may want to check the terms of service for a shared hosting account, your description of chatroom/game apps most likely violate the terms of service of many of them. Shared hosting is primarily designed to revolve around hosting of a website and not an actual service.

All in all that's the trade-off with shared hosting vs other platforms. Shared hosting is that pre-built apartment where you might can change the paint color but they aren't going to let you knock down walls or install new windows. If you need that level of control then some type of VPS/Cloud/Dedicated server is what you'd be going for.

I_AM_NOT_A_WOMBAT,"A few considerations.

/u/fp4 has a good point, and that VPS will have better specs than your RPi.

If you're just playing around, it's fine, but make sure your RPi has a firewall installed, and some kind of brute force protection, and check the logs now and then. I'd suggest not opening port 80 for a couple of reasons. First, you'll get a million hits with bots trying to hack Wordpress (whether you have it or not), and this will slow down your Pi. Second, your ISP may not like you hosting on port 80 even if it's just for yourself. If they catch you, they might be nice and tell you to stop, or they might drop your account.

I host my home server on the port that matches my house number. Easy to remember, rarely portscanned, and LFD blocks failed basic auth logins after a couple of attempts.

Your home IP might change. They can stay the same for months/years and if you're not using it for anything important while you might be away, all good to define it statically. Otherwise, you can use a dynamic IP service to update your IP if/when it changes (this is useful for people running security cameras or a VPN, for example).

If you're actually planning on hosting something where you want outsiders to be able to see it reliably, and you're proficient enough to host it yourself on a Pi, I think the cheap VPS solution would serve you better. It's fun to learn how to host things at home on such a tiny device, but it's actually good practice to spin up a VPS and get familiar with that as well.",1532649995.0
araa47,Depends on your use case. For running something like a dashboard to control your house this would be crucial since you want to store all the data and not give it to a third party service. Using something like Duckdns to get a public ip address and letsencypt to enable ssl would be a good start. You should usually disable any traffic on port 80 and maybe stick to using 443 for ssl.

To be honest no, it's not doomed to failure. A pi isn't going to have that much processing power, but if it's simply a static website then why not? It would make for a good learning experience and something you already have (read: free) to play around with. 

Your biggest concern should be the security aspect of the pi, you don't want to inadvertently turn it into a malware bot or similar. If you're only opening port 80 to it and everything is static (no php, mysql etc) then you will be fairly limited. But it's still a good ides to ensure remote connections are locked to your local network and strong passwords are employed.

I'm currently hosting my websites (eshops) in one of the Managed WordPress hosting companies, during my investigation I found a lot of reviews about the available solutions, *however*, every review I read had an affiliate link so I think all of them are biased.

During that research, I discovered the reviewsignal.com website, which does a yearly performance test on many managed WP solutions. It has affiliate links like all other review articles, but at least the results are based on a performance test. 

These are the results of their tests:
https://reviewsignal.com/blog/2015/07/28/wordpress-hosting-performance-benchmarks-2015/
https://reviewsignal.com/blog/2016/09/14/wordpress-hosting-performance-benchmarks-2016/
https://reviewsignal.com/blog/wordpress-hosting-performance-benchmarks-2018/

I've started hosting my websites on Managed WP providers in 2015, until now I've used WPEngine, Kinsta and Pressidium, before this change I was hosting my eshops on shared hosting providers. Any of the above three, that I've had personal experience with, is way better in regards of performance and support than the shared hosting provider I used in the past, so based on that I'm inclined to believe that any Managed WP provider will provide you with a better hosting experience.

Personally, I've ended up with Pressidium because of the nature of my websites, eshops need to always be up and running, any downtime equals with revenue loss, so my first concern was the hosting provider's availability/downtime/SLA and a support. WPEngine (my first try of managed WP) had a lot of issues with downtime, after numerous complaints their support informed me about their High-Availability plans, which is a way to increase the website's availability, and it is, of course, available in high-end plans only, which I couldn't afford at that time. Having known the term I've started looking for solutions that provided high-availability and that's how I ended up in my current hosting provider. I've been there for over 2 years now and I'm quite satisfied with my websites uptime and with their support, they helped me increase the website's performance by pinpointing the issues. They don't provide any development services so I had to hire a developer for actually solving these issues.

If your website needs increased availability you should be searching for high-available solutions, if the availability is not a major concern you can decide based on the reviewsignal.com performance tests. Support is also a major concern, unfortunately, you can't know if a company has good support unless you try them out.",1532873578.0

The email stack configuration is not unique to any VPS. You would have the same issues on any VPS. Email is not hard to setup, but it is a time investment and is certainly not a ""set it and forget it"" operation.

>I signed up for their Prime/Choice Plus plan, which seems pretty good because it comes with domain privacy and backup built in also. 

Best practice is to host with somebody who isn't your registrar. You can get cheap domain names multiple places. GDPR in Europe has forced several registrars to offer WHOIS Guard (domain  privacy) for free if they didn't already.

Also never trust the hoster's backup. it makes it easy, but you should always have your own backup stored someplace offsite from the host.

Check the hosting providers in the sidebar to start comparing hosts. There are certainly more out there.

OriginalSimba,"Shared Hosting is a model that was created in the 1990s to serve static HTML sites. It works well in that environment because a website was like 500kb at most. Even as they grew in size to a few megabytes it still worked because all the server was really doing is sending files to the user.

These days, websites are far more complicated. Most websites are running some kind of server-side programming language such as PHP. A single user on a WordPress site can easily consume 5mb to 15 mb of system RAM per request, and bloated sites sometimes require even more.

It's still possible to safely serve _a few_ websites from a single server with adequate RAM and CPU power, but there is a ceiling. And thanks to the wide variance in resource requirements from one WordPress site to the next, planning the right number of users per server is practically impossible. 

Then let's get to support. Because that particular marketplace is focused mostly on marketing itself as your personal jesus, the prices are insanely low. They sell ""managed"" service (it's not really managed but thats another bullet) for a few dollars per month. Less than a large meal for one at most Fast Food restaurants. How is that possible if it's managed? Who are they paying with your pennies to manage your server and 1000 other customers? How much do you imagine those employees are making and how skilled do you think they must be to command that particular level of compensation?

The answers are obvious, and also proven over years of watching the big players operate. They cannot make enough money selling their bargain bin service to hire and sustain an acceptable level of support for all of their users. In order to remain profitable in the marketplace, they resort to cost-cutting, such as hiring the cheapest labor farms they can to handle front-line support. Or performing disruptive maintenance during business hours because that's cheaper than paying engineers to work overnight.

There's a lot more I could say, such as how a problem with one customer drags everyone to hell with them, or how in an effort to prevent that they've adopted draconian responses which still hurt everyone... but this is lengthy and I think the point is made, there is no such thing as good shared hosting. Not since server-side processing became the standard. If you're just serving static HTML you'll be fine but if you want to use WordPress (which you probably do), you should rent a VPS.

calligraphic-io,"I managed servers for a SaaS product for about ten years. One of the other comments said:

> We've almost never updated the shared servers

I hated more than anything logging into a client's server that was versions behind the current LTS release (our product integrated with on-site software), and it happened all the time. One of the advantages of rebooting a server periodically is that *you know it actually will reboot*. A lot of time systems administrators will make changes on a server and forget to persist them, so they're lost on reboot. Figuring all of that out is a nightmare when a client is down and you can just feel their frustration with each additional minute of lost revenue/service.

Never rebooting a server means you **cannot** trust it to come back up if it goes down, and it eventually **will** go down: hardware failures, backup generator overloaded, hacked sites, etc.

Some others here say they only reboot on kernel upgrades. There are other upgrades that can cause system instability without a reboot, like some shared libraries. You have to look at what the upgrades are and at least restart all services that are depending on those upgrades.

Maintain an upgrade schedule and communicate it to your clients. Make it periodic (every two weeks for example) and do it at a time that's least likely to cause inconvenience to a client (middle of the night on Sunday is a good time). Perform the upgrades before hand on a mirror image of the client instance to make sure there are no conflicts and all services restart without error (check the logs and resolve every single error, don't let any slide). Use a stable OS distribution, like CentOS. Learn your OS thoroughly, and understand what each package being upgraded does. If you're lucky enough to have clients that have scaled out behind a load balancer, there's no down time.",1532706473.0

They have also recently changed their support offerings so that tickets are not always offered and you have to choose phone or chat support instead. This might work fine for some clients but personally I like submitting a ticket with all the relevant information and checking back later to see if it has been fixed or not rather than hanging off a chat in real time which can take quite a while with a non-trivial support request.

As others have pointed out I also fell foul of SiteGround resource limitations not long after I signed up. Once I enabled Dynamic Cache (available on the GrowBig and better plans), this significantly reduced the load on the server and I no longer exceeded any resource limits.

As @tjuk points out, a hosting company with LiteSpeed Cache enabled can often be just as fast or faster as a SiteGround account with Dynamic Cache enabled and often at much less cost.

Complexity and cost. It is easy to setup something that is more complex than you need and costs more than you want to pay. There are so many levers and sliders for any IaaS provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) that unless you know what you are doing it is easy to underestimate your needs.

Even Gmail loses data. [In 2011 they lost over 40,000 email accounts worth of data.](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-blames-software-update-for-lost-gmail-data/) and they were only able to recover some.

ruggieroav,"Just about every host that I have had services on has had at least one or more catastrophic failure while I was using them.  Some providers I stuck with, others I moved from, but the FIRST failure taught me that no one is truly responsible for my data but ME.  Companies can do their best to compensate, to re-provision, to reset, but they have no direct obligation to a single customer.  What DOES help a company's reputation is the timeliness of their response, their continued checking and testing of their own backups if they keep such, and to possibly even give the customer the tools to perform their own backup, preferably to a location NOT associated with the host or service in question.  For example, ever since I have noticed minor issues with the ""Eagle"" server on MXRoute I have gone in on a semi-regular basis and performed a CPanel backup to an offsite server I maintain.  (oddly enough one of the other off-site servers I use had an issue and all of its data was inaccessible for a time - luckily I had a backup for the backup).   


For a new user, even if you are semi-experienced with servers, it can be scary when things go ""poof"" and you don't have physical access to a machine to verify what is going on.  As it is a learning experience for you, it should also be a ten-fold learning experience for the provider, and they should at least double their efforts to enhance contingency plans already in place, if they don't already plan to establish them based on this incident.

justinvoelker,"I'm not trying to kick dirt on someone, but I am a former customer of MXRoute and would avoid them at all costs.

Long story short, if you absolutely depend on email, you need to be using something like G Suite or Office 365. If you are not running business-critical email, spinning up a docker container with [tvial/docker-mailserver](https://hub.docker.com/r/tvial/docker-mailserver/) is good enough for non-essential emails (I use it for sending/receiving logs on my home network). Another alternative for single-user email is Amazon SES for an SMTP and setting up your domain to forward all email to a Gmail address.

Longer story, I don't know that MXRoute knows how to correctly run a business. My story is one from a couple years ago (mid 2016) when, due to a series of failures, MXRoute went down for nearly an entire day. This resulted in enough bounced emails that one of my financial institutions reverted my contact preference to postal mail and sent me a letter saying ""we couldn't contact you by email, so back to USPS it is."" Who knows how much other mail I lost that I just plain never knew about. You wouldn't know any of this because the blog post that was written about it has since been deleted. Seems that has happened on more than one occasion--something happens, they fess up about the error, then remove their post about it. That was problem one.

Problem two was that I sent a lengthy email about the incident (and a couple other recent problems they had) basically just asking what steps were being taken to ensure this sort of massive downtime did not happen in the future. This is the entire response I got, verbatim: ""Hi there!  It sounds like you'll be happier with a different service."" I cancelled my service that day and spun up a docker image for free.

Again, I'm not here to kick dirt on MXRoute, just stating a few facts that would otherwise not be know to potential customers. I think the service MXRoute offers is sorely needed--simple, inexpensive email that doesn't require an expensive G Suite subscription. However, I also think MXRoute has not yet figured out how to provide that service in a reliable or professional manner.",1532390363.0

Mike here, from [MXroute.com](https://MXroute.com). I was the one messy tech guy that caused all this.

It's been a long time since I done some billing for [MXroute.com](https://MXroute.com) \- I tried giving some help to Jarland, and approved several orders that required fraud screening, unfortunately I did not recall that doing this could cause over a dozen accounts to be terminated. Not sure why, but that's what happened there. Jarland had told me in the past that this could happen, though I did not remember about it and this is what happened.I immediately opened a ticket with the affected clients (albeit it looks like I missed a few, I grabbed those from the module logs), and started restoring the accounts from backups we had available. Some backups were old - from 10/12th June, most were from 17th July. Again, an unfortunate event here that we didn't notice that the backups, meant exactly for this very same purpose (disaster recovery), weren't being generated accordingly.

I understand that this situation is a hassle for all clients involved, and I was the responsible tech for this, so I stood up until 4 pm of next day (was awake during the whole night) working on restoring the affected accounts and crediting the clients accordingly, then I went to sleep. When I woke up by midnight, Jarland told me what was going on here. I would like to publicly apologize for the delay on the tickets, particularly, any restore-related tickets, and the for hassle this may have caused to you. Though as a DevOp myself, I would definitely recommend clients to keep their own backups in their email clients / cloud storage accounts. Let's be real, if the data is important, then we should backup your data as well, other than relying on the email company to do it - even I do it in my personal email using a grandfather Gapps account and we're talking of Google!

The backups we run are meant to be used for these purposes, and we failed here. I did, particularly, not recalling that Jarland had seen this bug in the past and told me about it, ended up terminating some accounts.

That being said, if there's anything I can do, please do let me know and I'll do my best to help in every way I can.

I won't add to the other criticisms though.

You're just starting out, so these sorts of errors are likely, honestly. 

You've got a few alternatives: affiliate (take a fee for recommending the host to the customer), reseller (resell another hosts hosting environment) and VPS (manage a hosting environment virtualized on someones hardware

A few other things if you are going to do it:

1. One pages don't need a CMS normally, just do it static HTML and save on resources. 
2. You're limiting your clients from some pretty cool features, like being able to generate their own backup files if the backend panel allows it.
3. You are almost certainly breaching T&C and security best practice.

I know hosting seems like a good recurring income for a designer but when you can probably make similiar in year 1 from affiliate on the hosting side (not year two though) why bother?

UterineDictator,"Honestly, it sounds as though you've done quite well already. You obviously have the knowledge and dedication it takes to start a successful hosting business, being that you've accumulated enough clients to require >40 servers to accommodate them. Thousands have tried and failed at what you've already accomplished.

If you've hit a wall with where you want to go next, and in which direction you want to grow, take some time and do some market research. Are there are niche opportunities you can see in your local marketplace? Perhaps you could develop an unique service to package with your hosting product. Could you align yourself with Peruvian (or, more widely, South American) technology startups in some way, maybe by providing them with the technical expertise needed to host and expand their own product or service?

Buying up servers across the globe is an okay idea, but there are a *lot* of big players doing exactly that. It's not necessarily an over-saturated market, but it's certainly becoming that way. And the big players are now so firmly established that it's very hard to compete with them on price and product alone. This is why I think you should devise some unique service that complements your technical expertise and infrastructure. 

I know it's a lot harder than it sounds. I'd be happy to talk with you some more about this, and maybe brainstorm some ideas, if you're interested. Reply or PM if you'd like to.

Good luck!

* Digital Ocean is great and they have plenty of resources to help you get a VPS running in no time. Vultr and other alternatives are fine.
* I went with Servercloud because the implementation was easier. However, I would recommend starting with a paid plan so you can take advantage of custom user accounts and SSL.
* Google Domain so you can do mail forwarding and the easier to use DNS record settings.
* No preferences on either, for my career as a web developer I have ran into all of them and they are all great. For my freelance clients I use Ubuntu.
* Maldet to scan for malware occasionally (ServerPilot has a tutorial on how to implement), alerts to let you know if any client sites go down, Stripe or some kind of invoicing with subscription based to automatically charge your clients.

wolfcry0,"If you want the experience don't use Runcloud/Serverpilot, instead set up the webserver yourself on the VPS. Especially since you mentioned you want to be in control of things and not rely on a third party.

Vultr is great, been using them for awhile now. DO might have a few extra features like load balancing IIRC but it's unlikely you'll need them.

I'd go with Google Domains, Namecheap is solid but their web control panel is crap now.

Ubuntu or CentOS. Both have a ton of resources for help/guides.

You can upgrade later on easily, 512MB is fine for starting off and it's a useful skill to figure out how to minimize memory usage on the web stack.

It's more about traffic than number of actual websites for server sizing, having 1 or 10 sites with the same total traffic doesn't change the load on the server much. And it depends a lot on how heavy the websites are, if they're all static sites you can handle a huge amount of traffic on a very basic server.",1531580839.0

tsammons,"> Im looking at Vultr just because, it seems to have god reviews by users and has consistent network speeds. Does it lack any features that DO has? Any objections? Advice? 

It's all the same. A server is a server is a server. This is next generation shared hosting. Whether you land on a congested hypervisor or not is luck of the draw.

> What does Linode offer besides just great customer Service?

These are all self-managed. There is no customer service; you're on your own if things break. If you get hacked, you'll be forced to flatten and reinstall.

> Serverpilot or Runcloud?

Neither. They abstract the complexity of setting up a server and abstract in a bad way to the point where you're taught little and RC at least puts everything under 1 user. SP doesn't even ship with a firewall and that's a necessity in this day.

> Google Domain or Namecheap?

A domain is a domain. Keep all of your domains under 1 roof though to ease management. Some people have ethical misgivings with some companies (GoDaddy's former CEO), but otherwise it's all the same.

> Distro? BSD, Ubuntu, CentOS, Etc... Preferences? Pros Cons?

Today it seems that you'll find more information working with end-user software on Ubuntu LTS-based systems. I'm particular to CentOS, which has a 10 year lifecycle as opposed to 5 years with Ubuntu. Upside is newer software on Ubuntu for certain things, but you'll have to pack up and move or do an in-place upgrade every 5 years. Plus Ubuntu's main pathway for testing is Debian, Debian is volunteer driven. CentOS bottom feeds off Redhat and they're pretty thorough in delivery.

From a hobbyist, Ubuntu. If you are looking for something that might be slightly older, but more stable, CentOS.

> Any interesting neat out of the box experiments I should try on my VPS? Specific resources or guides I should look into in order to make the most out of my VPS. I believe learning new things and trying things opens doorways to bigger ideas.

Find a problem (or create one) and then build a solution. I started with programming to build a website around a website specifically designed to thwart cheating in high school. 16 years later, I'm still programming.

> Im assuming if my project outgrows itself I can upgrade at anytime. I'm going to build a few portfolio sites with zero traffic so I assume I should get the smallest plan at first. Vultr has a 512mb plan, is that just too small and will limit things, should I just go 1gb from the get go?

1 GB. 512 MB is insufficient for anything but a VPN/BNC. Spinning up a web server + database server + php-fpm processes will result in swapping almost immediately.

> Whats a rule of thumb for how many websites to memory I should have? Planning on hosting other peoples sites down the road once I figure everything out. Too tired of unreliable web hosting and I would rather be held accountable for everything

Memory is like beer, you can never have too much of it. If you are miserly on your memory and induce swapping, you'll be in a worse position than with a shared hosting provider that has gobs of processing power and memory to allocate to a server. 

Remember, that 1 vCPU you have is actually split 40+ ways among other users on a server. Servers are expensive and in order to properly pay down the $4,000 server cost + recurring ping/power/pipe variable costs, density has to be ratcheted up (much like shared hosting). The difference though is that the perceived congestion is shifted from the hosting provider to your VM with high load averages; this isn't always the case, often times it's just a congested hypervisor that can't address your VM's workload request. 

Always take a look at your load + steal % (`iostat -x 1` will show this). Load, aka run-queue size, is the number of processes running concurrently over a 1 minute interval. Steal is the percentage of time your VM requested a parcel of work be computed by the HV and the HV could not immediately address it. Unfortunately teasing out whether its you or them is more difficult, because the only surefire way to determine if it's the HV or you is to run the same workload on two identical machines that aren't on the same HV.",1531584000.0
mgcross,"Digital Ocean (or any other VPS) is kind of jumping into the deep end. There are good control panels available for them (runcloud, server pilot, etc), but you might be better off starting with managed hosting (like you'd find at Namecheap or Siteground). If you want to learn HTML and CSS, you also may want to avoid a CMS initially and hand code a simple static site. If you really want to learn from the ground up, that is. If that's the case, I would even recommend against preprocessors (SASS/SCSS) and task runners (gulp, grunt, npm) until you get your head around just HTML and CSS.

The good news if you go this route is that DigitaleaOcean has a ton of tutorials on various aspects of server management.

They did have lots of servers setup for shared hosting, but their online system that did all the setting up and creation was buggy - it would commonly choose the same server over and over again rather than balancing it across all the available ones. So one or two servers would have hundreds of websites all running at once, whilst some would only have a 100 or less, and wouldn't flinch at performance. The only way to fix that was to manually copy your data across, assign the less quiet server on your account, and pray the system would sync properly. But that took time, and with the heavy access restriction, it was near impossible for support to do them and would require senior/directors to do the impossible-for-support part, which majority of the time, they would consider the lowest priority and leave it for days, sometimes weeks.

AskBenjaminBraganza,"Hey man, 

If you have already decided on choosing a WordPress website for travel and lifestyle, that is great. I would suggest you that you take a look at some good UK based hosting providers like InMotion, HostGator, Bluehost. Or you can choose a web host that has a data center ( place that stores data of web files and provides faster network connectivity) in the U.K. One such provider is ResellerClub. Their hosting is cheap and effective. Most, importantly, it is way within your budget. If you start with their shared hosting plan, it costs $2-$3. Before you buy a hosting plan, I would suggest you draw or chart out what kind of requirements you need. Is it just a blog or a business website?? and how many visitors do you estimate on a monthly basis? Do you plan to earn money through this blog/website? 

Some of the key features of ResellerClub are : 

1 ***) Provides a great server up time-*** *A consistent uptime record indicates that your website’s health is guaranteed. The truth is that a good hosting service will provide you with 99.9% uptime. Always ensure that you ask your colleagues or people from your industry about the uptime that their webhosting service provider is guaranteeing them.*

2) ***Ensures safety and security-*** *You can check if your service provider complies with the standards and upgrades of the industry. Figure this out by getting in touch with their clients and get an idea about the frequency of updates for security. Also, ensure that your data is protected from viruses, malware and phishing attacks. If this research is satisfactory, move on to the next question*.

3) ***Has a great backup and recovery plan-*** The *hosting should be secure in case of a virus, DDoS or malware attack, so ensure that your service provider has a sound backup plan.*

4) ***Provides you overall reports***\- *A hosting service that provides overall reports of upgrades it has done, how many upgrades it has done and what attacks it has checked for and what performance it has given over the month, is a service to bank on. Some of these performance indicators are responsible for easy functioning of your website.*

5) ***Provides you with resources instantly as you scale business***\- I*f you are upping the ante when it comes to your business, you will need deployment of resources to walk hand in hand since profitability is the final goal for any business. So, ensure that your provider has good plans for scale.*

If you are talking about really cheap reseller hosting services, [ResellerClub](https://www.resellerclub.com/) is an ideal choice. Just go through their pricing plans and chose UK as your server if you want to go for a hosting plan. ",1531917100.0

>So why do so many people go to shared hosting vs VPS?

You could be using a VPS to host hentai websites, while people who use shared hosting are hosting their small business websites, or landing pages for potential clients while they network at exhibitions.
Shared Hosting is pretty much intended for certain kind of sites and a certain kind of audience. If I were to host a portfolio of my photographs, I would prefer a good shared host.",1531324214.0
tsammons,"Shared hosting hardware for hardware is more performant (or should be on paper). You're deduplicating a lot of essential system services (syslog, database, web server, mail server, etc). From what I've seen though, this isn't always the case. The hardware necessary to be a shared host is much less than a VPS. Shared host needs a tower on a baker's rack (JaguarPC did this) whereas a VPS provider will need a good tier Xeon with VT-d and motherboard with IOMMU; those are found on higher end components.

There's also good shared hosting and bad shared hosting providers. You shouldn't run into issues with setting up Stripe on a shared hosting environment. It should be configured from the start to allow you to utilize Stripe without requiring shell and even if it did, support should be able to provide a workaround or at least the means to utilize it. Shared hosting should be configured from the start to allow you to do 95% of jobs so long as it won't directly affect others.

Server load on a shared hosting environment is absolute; it's the total run-queue size of all processes on the server. You can tell pretty easily when you are overloaded in a shared environment. With VPS that run-queue size is relative to *just* your instance. If the hypervisor is congested, it'll translate to higher load averages, but whether you're running too much on that VPS or the VPS itself is oversold beyond reasonable capacity is impossible for you to know without running an identical workload on 2 identical nodes. 

VPS is next generation shared hosting. It limits liability to just you and obviates a host from having to provide a sysadmin to watch over your node. They can cut cost and when your site gets hacked, reformat your node. No further work is needed on their part and damage is contained to just your node. If you're comfortable with CLI, go with it. Be sure to keep up to date with your installed software, install fail2ban, and configure a firewall to block everything inbound except what is vitally necessary.",1531328211.0

We were sorry to hear about your decision to discontinue using our services. We would like to address your comment about the support you are getting for you cloud plan.   


In general, we have integrated proactive checks that monitor the support inquiries of clients and if we see any unusual changes in patterns, the system makes adjustments or sends alerts to trigger manual reviews. We suppose in your case the system has detected an increase in chat inquiries regarding the 503 errors. That is why it started redirecting you to our Helpdesk more often and sending your ticket for handling by people with more experience in investigating this type of issue. The purpose of this is to make sure that the problem get resolved on a more global and professional scale and reduce the number of back and forth communications in order to create a better experience for you ultimately. This does not mean we will deny service on chat or phone, but we will aim to keep the handling of an open case in the ticket until we achieve the goal.

Unfortunately, we were not able to review your case in more details because we could not locate your account in our system. We would like to help out sorting out the cause of the 503 errors and work with you on finding a permanent solution. Please send us more details about your account via a private message or in an email to reviews at siteground dot com so we can escalate the issue.

* Backups are the responsibility of the customer. Providing a backup is a nice thing to do, but given the nature of a breach you should hold this in your discretion and charge a modest recovery fee.

For what definition of cloud and what workload? What are you trying to run? is it just a VPS? Do you need to be able to scale ""infinitely""? I ask becasue DigitalOcean/Vultr are great fixed-price alternates without all the additional ""stuff"" that comes with a full PaaS/IaaS provider.

Support depends on what you need. For Google, AWS, or Azure unless you have some enterprise contract you're getting forum support, if that. No way to reach a live person unless you're twitter famous (i.e. bitch and somebody will reach out to you). Smaller providers haven't automated away all the support yet.

If I'm building Windows VMs then I look at Azure.

If I'm working with someone who is building a scaling web app from scratch I'm probably looking at AWS. Azure is catching up but has a way to go.

Google cloud has better logging (stackdriver can also be used with AWS) and has a design that makes it feel easier. It can integrate with existing google accounts AFAIK. Kubernetes started in Google so they're ahead of the curve on that but, if you're asking what you need as such a high level you're probably not at a point where containerization should be a concern, it's also something that is available in other services, or at least [in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) but I can't speak to comparisons between them.

Azure is pretty much only good if you're heavily integrated and dependent on Microsoft software. It's got a few real awful gotchas in terms of billing and the account system is an absolute mess.

At the end of the day there's a lot of ""what you feel better with"" but, AWS is my preferred with some third party logging solutions and a build server  - OpsWorks, aforementioned, does have the ability to pull from Repos and AWS has it's own git system available. Some languages, like [Python](https://www.zappa.io/) (there's [a bunch](https://chalice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) and [Node](https://www.serverless.com) (Serverless started life as AWS focued [JAWS](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/austen-collins/)), have stuff available to make deploying serverless tools to AWS extremely easy.


Most none of those are going to see you getting a lot of support from the companies though, that's more a VPS type thing you'd get from a DigitalOcean type. For price Lightsail (AWS) is an example of a fairly cheap competitive price to those services but, most of these are designed with the idea that you have to tools to scale up your applications as appropriate and all feature a range of stuff that is useful for corporate users and the extra tools around add a bit of cognitive load and might lead to playing around with stuff you don't need or want.

xzene,"I basically do the same and am in the same boat.  If they remove catch-all support you can't really mimic the functionality without a lot more work.  

Before catch-alls I used to manually create an alias for each address and forward it to my central mailbox (or for some things a dedicated mailbox) but due to the lag on creating a new alias or mailbox being too long I ended up just switching to catch-all and have been using that for about 8 years now.

Their proposed solution of using the ""+"" alias method doesn't really allow for blocking compromised addresses since your real mailbox address is part of the alias, whereas with the catch-all not only can you set it to delete on the server any address that is compromised you can change the underlying forwarding address if that somehow got compromised without having to go change a lot of addresses on the sites you've registered on.  I literally have hundreds of these email addresses I've given out for sites/companies/people and couln't possibly remember which ones need to be recreated, especially the stuff I had set up as a one time deal.

I don't use my old blog any more, so really the only reason I have kept my hosting account is for the catch-all functionality but if they are taking that away I'll have to move on.

The only businesses that permanently lose their data are the ones that're negligent and don't keep their own backups.

If your data's important to you, back it up. This applies regardless of the provider you're using - Things go wrong sometimes, you should treat any backups that a provider supplies you with as a convenience, ultimately it's *your* data and if it's important to you, having all of it solely in the hands of one other entity is your error.

Ultimately, between the big names you've mentioned you generally won't go far wrong. AWS and Google Cloud's pricing is more complex than others, my preference between DigitalOcean/Linode/Vultr tends to lean towards Linode, but that isn't really based on anything particularly concrete.

Learning how to manage a VPS instance if ultimately you just want your site to be online is not going to be the most straightforward option, even if you are going to use a control panel system to help you.

If you don't mind sinking time into learning how to make everything work, and availability of your site is not paramount (when you make a seemingly minor change a few months down the line that knocks your site offline you're going to have no support to turn to with an un-managed VPS, it'll be offline until you can figure out and fix your problem) then barebones VPS's are good solutions.

But like many of us, we are not Linux wizards so you might want to use a hosting panel to take care of your VPS  .

Rednaxila,"Hey u/CaptainFluffyTail, I have experience with DreamHost (a premium web host), Amazon LightSail and Digital Ocean. I have been running both my sites and web apps on DreamHost's VPS (started with Shared Hosting) for about 7 years now. WordPress loading times were always incredibly slow, especially for the price I was paying; however, I always thought that it was the WordPress platform itself – a powerful engine at the cost of a slow, heavy backend.

I was recently working with a script that simply would not work on DreamHost's servers. I kept getting errors regarding server response time on certain view controllers of the web app. As a university student, I was offered a promo code from Facebook's FbStart program for 12 months of free LightSail service – so I decided to try it out.

**Wow.**

The script ran and loaded at 10x the speed of this premium web hosting service that I had been paying $27.50 a month for. After playing around with the new script for a bit, I decided that I was going to try out WordPress next.

**WOW.**

I was almost mad at how I had been paying nearly $330 a year for a service that was offering inferior performance. LightSail offered superior service with many more, additional options of deploying web apps and such. I cannot recommend it enough. The setup can be a little difficult and tedious to get started if you're not familiar with deploying. However, the hassle is worth it.

I also tried out Digital Ocean because I wanted to see if they offered an easier, more user-friendly experience for setting up simple WordPress sites. The learning curve is about the same – someone more experienced with cloud services may be able to come on here and add details to my comment.

Don't get me wrong, DigitalOcean, Vultr and Linode are all very good VPS providers, but VPS providers is exactly what they are and no more.

On paper they're actually less resilient than many others - Plenty of VPS providers provision VM's on clustered sets of hypervisors and shared storage so that your VM simply restarts elsewhere if a node fails, none of the big names do this, instead your machine exists on a node with local storage, and the VM is entirely reliant on that node - This simplicity is what makes them cheap, with the expectation that you take care of HA requirements in software using multiple nodes.

My experience with dedicated servers is very positive, but it's just not cost efficient.

>* On-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

>* Broad network access. Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).

>* Resource pooling. The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. 

>* Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

>* Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

With a provider like Digital Ocean you can build a cloud-based application easily. DO droplets are the same (conceptually) as the sized hosts in AWS.  You can provision or deprovision droplets from the command line. If you had orchestration software (Ansible, etc.) you could spin up additional droplets and deploy your code as needed then deprovision them the same way. If you just spin up a droplet and use it to host your webpages it isn't really different from any other VPS at that point. It is cheap becasue of capacity and scale.

The term ""cloud"" has become marketing hype for most providers anymore. I can spin up a VPS on a hypervisor and call it ""cloud hosting"" for whatever that is worth. I could even spin up a Virtual Private Server on AWS (or similar on Azure) and use it just like any other VPS. At the end of the day it is a virtual machine running on a hypervisor I essentially rent time on.

Applications that do not need a dedicated host, can be managed without having to interact with humans at all , and can scale up or down in CPU, network, or storage automatically is what a true ""cloud"" application is all about (per definition). You can run web applications in this model depending on the architecture. The cost of all that flexibility however is often much greater than simply renting a virtual machine on the same provider and using it like any other VPS.

tl;dr: most ""cloud"" offerings are marketing snake oil. A VPS is a virtual machine at the end of the day. The machine is only as secure as you make it. Providers offering visual firewall editors do not make it more or less secure. ",1530187653.0
OriginalSimba,"""Cloud"" is a bullshit marketing term. It means _nothing_. Different people use it for completely different purposes. There is no agreed upon definition.

A VPS is exactly the same as a Dedicated server in terms of how resources are divided up amongst the machines. You get privacy, high performance (with SSD storage) and usually they are very easy to scale up as your needs grow.

A dedicated server does not offer easy scaling. There is usually a setup fee or at a minimum a setup delay because a physical machine has to be built and prepped and racked just for you. The costs are typically much higher if your needs are light-weight, compared to VPS. However if you need tons of RAM or storage space, a Dedicated Server can present a superior choice.

Just be aware, when you need to upgrade that machine in 3-5 years it's going to be costly, compared to a VPS where hardware upgrades can take place in the background without interrupting your service.

Lets use Digital Ocean as an example. The low-cost value of a VPS starts to drop as you require more than 8GB of RAM. After that point a VPS with D.O. is about the same cost as a dedicated server with Quickpacket. But if you need 8gb or less, the VPS is a better value.",1530201315.0

**A Record** = Points a textual reference like forum.mysite.com to an IP address like 12.12.12.12.

**CNAME** = Points another name to an A Name, so you could make tribbles.mysite.com point to forum.mysite.com

**MX Records** = These are used to say what server will handle mail for @mysite.com and point to an A Name. 

**SPF Records** = These are used for verification and anti-spam of your MX Records, can be complicated.

**TXT Records** = These are used to put textual data which doesn't really go anywhere into the domain system, again often used for mail verification with DKIM / SPF. 

For a web domain like you mysite.com to resolve to your webhosting and actually show your website, you'll need to create an A record for mysite.com, and set the value to 12.12.12.12 (or whatever the server IP is). That's really enough for a basic site to be visible. But, no mail would arrive to your email address if you stop here... 

If you want to do mail, depending on your server set up, it **might** be enough to just set the MX record values to mysite.com and points to mysite.com. Because you're behind cloudflare, this **won't** work, if you're orange clouded, because cloudflare ""proxies"" your server and any mail will hit their IP first (for technical reasons I won't explain here). So, you'll need to set up a separate A record to a location like mail.mysite.com, and resolve the MX record to that A Record instead. If you want to avoid landing in people's spam folder's you'd be advised to install an SSL for the mail subdomain as well, and fill in the SPF and DKIM records properly.

When you're a mail provider and relying on them to make up part of your anti-spam strategy, the right blacklists can be your superhero first-line of defense.

When you're trying to send mail and they're causing your recipients to block your messages, they're the spawn of Satan and must be destroyed in any way possible.

When I was in your position I found it easiest to deal with the situation by putting myself in their shoes for a minute. Here is an IP that has been blocked multiple times for similar reasons, and here comes another Joe Schmoe who wants us to remove it...again. Who is he? Why should we trust what he says? Our clients rely on us having accurate lists, so it's in our interest to remove the IP if Joe is truly trustworthy, but we also have an obligation to leave it listed if Joe is not. And who is to say that Joe Schmoe isn't Spammy McSpammington in disguise -- the guy who asked us to unblock the IP two months ago, just so he could send another hundred thousand unsolicited messages?

1) Follow their rules. Every blacklist is similar, but a little bit different. Some accept email, some require a web form. Some require a human interaction, some will work with just automation.

(1a: This may involve sending support tickets to your provider to have them open the communication. It's quite common for blacklists to only talk to the owner of the IP space, and if your name doesn't show up on the WHOIS for the IP then you're not it.)

2) Don't give up your credit card or social security info, but answer their questions honestly, with as much detail as possible. They need to trust your intent is to not spam them.

3) Be firm, but have some patience and realize that at the other end of the problem is another human being that has to make decisions about your account. Kindness and understanding will go a long way in solving the problem.

Caching is a way to speed up a website indeed, but when you have something as complex as a shopping cart, the amount of calls and calculations made to create each page can place a burden on the website. Most shopping carts have to appeal to their purchasers, which means add XYZ features because I need it to do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Each time they do this, it creates more load and causes more backend work to be done.

Since it's a one size fit's all, you can't easily get the bloat out and thus you end up with horribly slow shopping carts and caching.

blindpet,"I just wanted to chime in here and noticed you are using CF Flexible SSL so you are 'doing it wrong'. Your redirects should be page rules in CF so your visitors do not have to wait for your origin server to process the .htaccess rules. If you do not have enough page rules you should actually be using the nginx proxy to do the redirects. Using Apache which is the final link in the chain is the least optimal way to go about these redirects.

The reason they ask for your domain is to run some tests, not providing this in an initial support ticket is one of the most frustrating things for support staff because it means asking for it and waiting for a reply before they can actually help which only delays any possible resolution.

Disabling CF is also a basic troubleshooting step to make sure there are no page rules conflicting there.

Performance is great:
The performance of Linodes is absolutely fantastic. I have a 4GB Linode with over a hundred sites and it works great. Some of the sites get >10K per month and it's always snappy.
I've had issues with other hosts when it comes to disk io or network transfer but no issues with Linode.

Support is fantastic:
Despite what others have speculated their support is second to none. They are fast at responding to tickets and they are extremely knowledgeable. I try not to ask them things which are beyond their remit but there have been times when I've been desperate and they've been very helpful. You can find a lot of userful info in the server logs and there is also help available on stackoverflow if you ever get stuck.

Control panels:
I looked into Plesk and Cpanel and found them to be expensive and overkill for what I was doing. There are probably free ones out there but I ended up configuring my own server and writing some scripts to automate most of it. Configuring LAMP isn't that hard and it will give you a better idea of how it works should anything go wrong. I used to run a plesk server at great expense and would be at the mercy of their engineers if anything failed, now I can fix everything myself.

Mail server:
I'd recommend setting up postfix, ideally on a separate Linode. I prefer to keep the two separate for added redundancy but you don't have to. There are tutorials to help with LAMP and Postfix. There is a lot to learn but it's ultimately worth it imo and I wish I had done it earlier.

I made some notes when I was setting up my servers way back when. They are a little sketchy but you may find some of it useful. There are better tutorials out there but I pulled a lot of different concepts together e.g. I include setting up FTP, Firewall, Spam protection etc.

Have 15 servers with them(I had retired a couple more), had only one incident (last year their dns server dropped for 2h and I don't know how or why the 2nd one didn't work so there is that, I now use both their dns and my local isps service as most visitors will have better latency that way).

I don't know what Magento benefits from but I think it might benefit from high memory bandwidth and many cores new amd epyc cpus offer. Hetzner has what they call ax160, they come base with 128gb of ram running in 4 channels, amd epyc 7401p. 2x Samsung pm963 960GB nvme ssds, you can add more or bigger ssds. You can optionally install 10gb nics and request a 10gbit Internet line. The biggest downside to that cpu is the low clock speed, 2.0 base, 2.8 all core boost, so some queries take fairly longer then what they would with lower core count cpus. The system costs 169€ base which is mind-boggling for me still as at Google a comparable machine would cost you over 5x that, not counting the huge bandwidth costs.

Hetzner has a limit of 50TB bandwidth for the ax160 but you can commit to pay 1.25€ per tb over that.

On the other hand, mitigating ""malware"" by taking obfuscation steps is the wrong way to deal with things. The better way is to learn proper Wordpress security:

* Set up hosting properly where Wordpress and the web server's process has no write access to any place that allows PHP execution.
* Install only the barest minimum of plugins which you absolutely need.
* Update the moment updates are available, even if it breaks shit (that goes for Wordpress AND the AMP parts).
* Use an SSL certificate and https or an ssh tunnel so that you NEVER log in over cleartext.
* Don't log in from or store password on Windows systems.

From your post, I believe you can get the best value and protection, as well as support for the server by purchasing a reseller package so that you have one management platform for all the sites. That way, your management portal will allow you to easily see all accounts, change passwords, manage emails, etc. and each site will still be partitioned against one another in case of any issues.

That is cost effective and keeps you out of the server driver’s seat so you can focus on your clients.

If one has an exploit then under most cases that site can write to any other folder in the same cpanel account.

Basically with this, if one site gets hacked your others are not affected.

* I say most cases because its not impossible to better isolate addon domains under the same cpanel account but your hosting company would certainly advertise this if it was the case.

Separating the sites does not protect them from getting malware if there is an exploit, just protects ones that might not have exploits from also being affected.

It seems that you are disappointed in the feedback and that ""customer service is a commodity you can no longer afford"". Perhaps my standards are different than yours, but veerotech has redifined customer service for me, despite them initially going against every fiber of my being seeing that they where ticket based only.

Not only has veerotech helped me I with cpanel issues, they share knowlage about why and how certain things happened, and how to prevent them, so I frequently use my own closed tickets as my personal knowlage base, and in turn strive to treat my own customers with the same care and interaction.

Now, Im going to be brutally honest: as a one man shop, I personally avoid getting invovled with ""high maintenance"" clients, it's just how I feel and it's not worth it to me, so I cherry pick on an appointment basis every single person that ends up on my reseller.

Because if that, i do my very best to be as low maintenance as possible when I send a ticket to veerotech (at least I hope I am!), but regardless of how In depth the ticket is, I know that veerotech understands you must be willing to sometimes crossover that line to help the customer, so you might want to give them a try.

And FTP access/management is standard on most legitimate shared hosting companies.  You can find many hosts (besides our services) that will also charge only $2-$5 per month (when paid for a year or more in advance) for everything including SSL and backups, email and malware scanning.

As far as the ""unlimited"" thing - unless you are abusing the services there is no way a PERSONAL website will ever come close to reaching any limits on a valid hosting platform.

>Our next host will be an ""FTP host"" -- one that lets you upload your site via FTP. 

I wouldn't recommend using FTP as there is no encryption with that. Instead, look for a host that offers SSH for file transfer in addition to FTP.

>They offer ""unlimited transfer"" -- but does that mean unlimited uploads, or does it include downloads?

I don't see anything about unlimited transfer but I do see ""UNLIMITED Disk Space"" and ""UNLIMITED Bandwidth""

People will argue that the unlimited bandwidth is a red flag because it's false advertising because how much bandwidth you can use it's limited by your connection speed and since the server doesn't have a ∞Mb/s internet connection it's not truly unlimited. They're just cynical, don't listen to them. It just means there's no hard or soft cap on bandwidth usage. That's not really all that big of a red flag.

However, the unlimited stage part is a red flag. It's I've thing to offer as much data as you can push through a connection but it's another thing entirely to offer someone as much harddrive space as they can manage to use. There's a reason you don't see people from /r/DataHoarder getting one of these, slapping Nextcloud on there and uploading 2 PB of files on there.

1. You can use any number of applications that are already built for form / data input – and many of these are available as plug-ins / extensions to Wordpress which is very easy to use. If you want to do that ask your web host to install Wordpress and find a good form manager to install on top of that via the extensions section.

2. You can also learn to code yourself and make a PHP app that saves all the form data in a MySQL database that you can then read/write. Both PHP and MySQL are available from your control panel. Both are free. If you want to do that, look up CRUD database and start from there.

BUT here’s where it is important. DO NOT START ACCEPTING DATA FROM USERS unless they understand that you are new to this and your app is “in development” and not secured and it is your first attempt.

When we detect malware on your account we notify you immediately. Our notice informs you that you have 7 days grace period to clean up your account and we provide you details on the affected files and their location. In case the malware is still present on your website after the grace period is over we suspend web service for your site as it poses a security risk to other users hosted on the same server.    


As removal of malware is outside the scope of our services if you are not able to clean up your website on your own we suggest as an alternative the paid service by a third-party provider that has expertise in this field. When you have removed the compromised files you can request a secondary scan of your account. Once our team verifies that all malicious code is removed we restore web service.

meetAQ,"Thanks for posting the update. I'm Abdul Qadir, Vice President for Cloudways. We have been in constant contact with the OP to ensure transparency and would be keep him updated on the developments.

We really apologize for the incident and accept its COMPLETE responsibility and have been in constant contact with the customer to ensure transparency throughout the investigation.

This was the case of an individual copying customer's website while doing its migration to Cloudways and use it as a template for his friend's website. The site was copied on Cloudways infrastructure (cloudwaysapps domain) and was not live when taken down. Being the assigned Engineer for migration, he had access to the website of the customer. In normal circumstances, Engineers only access the assets when needed and we exhaustively log and audit such transactions. This terrible unethical act of the engineer will not only cost him the career (employment ended already) but serious legal action as well.

When the customer approached our Support Team to complain about the same, due to the very unusual nature of this incident, the junior engineer on shift confused this with multiple things and could not attend the customer properly which caused further frustration on the customer end. We sincerely apologize for that too. We realize that it has to do with lack of experience in handling complex incidents and awareness of this newly hired engineer, besides unusual nature of the incident.

While we are fully accepting the lapse, we would like to assure that it is NOT the case of general abuse and has nothing to do with the general Culture, Processes, and People of Cloudways. It’s very shocking and disturbing and much more when we as a company recently started very structured efforts towards Brand, Culture, and Values.

Besides taking action against the engineer involved, we are doing an exhaustive review to identify improvements in our audit and monitoring systems. Meanwhile, some new technical SOPs and escalation processes are now in place to ensure any complex cases such as this is escalated and handled properly. Most of the external outgoing emails are tracked and logged as part of our monitoring policy but certain teams weren’t part of the policy due to the rare use of their emails for external communication, we are now extending the policy to ensure ALL external outgoing emails are tracked and logged. 

As for the people part, it's already one of our KEY targets for 2018 to further professionalize our functions from people and processes aspect. We have recently hired a top-notch HR director to improve the hiring process and address the pain points felt by hyper-growth companies when hiring fast as well as onboarding and training aspects. We already do trainings but to focus further we hired a team of two dedicated trainers seeding a small ""training organization"" within an organization focusing just on training. Training i.e. both general training and departmental training. The team will give much detailed attention to Culture and Values part. We are soon announcing the onboarding of a ""Been there done that"" Veteran, and this is particularly important as we are about to expand our hiring in the European region.

Our GDPR efforts have already helped in streamlining quite a few things. We worked with a professional firm in Q4 2017 and Q1 2018 to achieve initial compliance and currently working on an extended roadmap to strengthen further. As for the Security of our Platform, we have adequate measures in place, to improve further we signed an agreement with BugCrowd in Q1 2018.

While we would do more technical efforts, the real thing will be to ensure human integrity and ethics, as we all agree that these systems ultimately rely on the ""human"" part. For which key efforts as mentioned above are already in action.

At Cloudways we are committed to delivering a secure and reliable platform to our customers and become a partner in their growth. Our consistent NPS rating of over 60 shows how much love exists for Cloudways and we are committed to ensure this score goes up as we go forward. With the support of our customers and the feedback from users who help us by identifying areas for improvement, we are certain to reach our intended goals.",1529092749.0

kryptondog,"First: What the OP describes is completely unacceptable, and I'm shocked that a company like Cloudways didn't already have procedures in place to prevent something like this from happening. I'm glad that this was brought to our attention, and I'm glad that Cloudways is working with them to address these issues - I'll be watching closely for further developments as well.

But with all that said: I want to add a small note of defense for Cloudways, as well as share my hope that the policy changes OP and Abdul have outlined will be enacted. If so, I wouldn't be disinclined from using them in the future. I've got several sites hosted through Cloudways, and I really love their service offerings - being a front-end developer who is decidedly not an expert system administrator, their dashboard exposes just the right amount/type of settings for what I need to do at a server level for my sites. And their support team has always been great to work with in my experience - I've never had anything less than a positive experience interacting with them. I also appreciate that Abdul joined this thread to give us an official response from Cloudways on the matter.

None of that excuses what happened, of course, but if it was a ""bad apple"" employee and if Cloudways is serious about taking steps to keep this from happening again, I'll gladly continue using them, and I'd encourage folks to not automatically pass them up for consideration on future projects. That said, these days there's a good number of competitors offering similar services to Cloudways, so the burden is definitely on them to take this seriously and show their customers by word and by deed that it won't happen again.",1529184534.0

* First up - do you have whois privacy enabled? If no, yes it's trivial see you own both
* I don't know how NC hosting works, where are your files stored? This path may be output if any of your sites have an error - does that give it away?
* Do you plan on or have you ever used one domain as a preview domain for the other? Specifically have you ever had a HTTPS certificate issued for that site e.g. (if you now have hiddensite.com and example.com have you ever used hiddensite.example.com)
* Another obvious one - do they link to each other in any way
* If I use your site(s) to contact you, will you respond from the same email address
* If I use your site(s) to contact you and I include a link will you click on the link from both without thinking to hide that

Essentially this can go on forever, if I really want to find who owns a site I'll probably be able to in most cases short of silk road scenarios.

hostboogie,"The first server you mentioned is using a processor that is nearly 10 years old.  While that isn't the only factor of whether or not a processor is good (the X5600 series is actually still pretty good for what they are, depending on how much of a demand your sites are requiring) but still lacks a lot of features newer CPU's can support.    


The specs on that all seem wacky as well.  That processor should be a 6 core/12 thread processor, and 4024MB RAM is not even a real thing, should be 4096 to specify 4GB, while that may seem trivial, seems weird that a provider would advertise such blatantly incorrect information.  That would definitely be cause for alarm for me.    


The other VPS' you didn't really give much other info on, they are running SSD's, which will be an automatic upgrade to the first listed server.  Do you know what CPU's the VPS' are using?  The first VPS you listed is only running a 100mbps NIC, which I would also recommend staying away from.

KH-DanielP,"Eh, this is a tough one, because 'hacked' can mean so many things.

Our policy for instance is to do our best to mitigate the damage being caused by the hack. If we can do that by disabling a few files/folders/plugins and sending you a notice that's what we'll do, but if your site is badly compromised, being used for illegal gains such as debit/credit card phishing, attacks, brute forces etc we cannot guarantee that what we disable won't break/disable your website either.

It's a tough line to follow as we do understand that clients need to fix things, but at the same time, once we're made aware of illegal activity (and yes, let's not mince words, a website being hacked is 9 times out of 10 performing illegal acts of intrusion attempts, bank fraud, spam or whatever else) then we have to take reasonable measures to stop the activity. 

You'll also want to look at hosts who aren't in the EIG bandwagon, you may get a bit more flexibility out of things that way, but end of the day while yes you as a customer are important to most web hosts, the damages a hacked site can bring far outweigh any potential income that a shared hosting customer can bring.

Sorry to hear that you've run into the dreaded WP compromise.

To answer your question if it could have come from higher up, the chances of that are very very slim. 99.989&#37; of all WP compromises come from it being out of date, or out of date plugins and themes. 

This folder here: 

d\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  2 root     root     4.0K Mar 28 00:50 xaisyndicate/

Has been owned by the root user and set to 000 permissions.

So there is no way for you, as a shared user, to delete it. They would have to delete this for you, or set permissions back to where your account owns it so that you can delete it.

I would recommend looking at all of your files for anything that has been modified on or around ""Mar 28 00:50"" as this is a first step in locating the rest of the compromise. Then you just go form there looking for shells, random files, injections and the likes. ",1528890797.0

Name servers are used to determine WHO is in control of where your domain goes. On the other hand, DNS records/entries are used to determine WHERE your domain goes. So your nameservers are at Google (and should stay there) because that control panel is capable of telling you where your domain and sub domains go. A nameserver is in control of ALL sub domains in addition to your root domain.

Your DNS entry is telling a specific sub domain what server to send people to when they visit (in this case an A record), like example.com goes to 174.65.124.80, otherhost.example.com goes to 123.145.67.189.

ColonialReddit098,"I have used both [ServerPilot](https://serverpilot.io) and [Runcloud](https://runcloud.io/).

I have no affiliation with either services but I am a great support of one product as it has truly made life much easier when it comes to hosting.

For those who have stumbled onto this thread, in essence the above services are hosting panels like cPanel . The advantage with Runcloud and Serverpilot is they can basically manage a VPS for you from Digital Ocean, Linode , Vultr . These VPS are dirt cheap and a **MUCH** better offering than most shared hosting companies.  I would love to explain this in a post but apparently im unable to create a visible post on this subreddit and moderators and not doing anything.

Anyway, to the original question.

# Runcloud

[Runcloud](https://runcloud.io/) is the new kid on the block for management panels . Its is the cheapest at $10 a month for managing   **unlimited**  number of  servers .

The main pro of Runcloud is its price and features. It has one click free SSL , health monitoring , web deployment with git! ,  file manager and code editor,  cron job manager and more.

Basically its a steal at $10 a month . So my recomendation is here

# ServerPilot

[ServerPilot](https://serverpilot.io) has been on the block for years and has proven to be the most popular solution out there.

As an honest opinion, Runcloud does everything ServerPilot does and at a much cheaper price. ServerPilot has business tiers but those features are already present in Runcloud.

The management panel is a bit sparse but it DOES the job. Serverpilot recieves a thumbs up from me.

# Conclusion

Best bet forward is [Runcloud](https://runcloud.io/) . Cheaper and more feature rich than Serverpilot.

However if this question was asked a few years prior , Serverpilot all the way.

There's no ""free"". There's always a catch. And with similar logic, you should be wary of impossible bargains.

meetAQ,"The OP has posted a new thread with the updates with reference to this incident and the investigation Cloudways did.

https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/8r61qc/update_to_cloudways_web_hosting_issue/

We really apologize for the incident and accept its COMPLETE responsibility and have been in constant contact with the customer to ensure transparency throughout the investigation.

This was the case of an individual copying customer's website while doing its migration to Cloudways and use it as a template for his friend's website. The site was copied on Cloudways infrastructure (cloudwaysapps domain) and was not live when taken down. Being the assigned Engineer for migration, he had access to the website of the customer. In normal circumstances, Engineers only access the assets when needed and we exhaustively log and audit such transactions. This terrible unethical act of the engineer will not only cost him the career (employment ended already) but serious legal action as well.

When the customer approached our Support Team to complain about the same, due to the very unusual nature of this incident, the junior engineer on shift confused this with multiple things and could not attend the customer properly which caused further frustration on the customer end. We sincerely apologize for that too. We realize that it has to do with lack of experience in handling complex incidents and awareness of this newly hired engineer, besides unusual nature of the incident.

While we are fully accepting the lapse, we would like to assure that it is NOT the case of general abuse and has nothing to do with the general Culture, Processes, and People of Cloudways. It’s very shocking and disturbing and much more when we as a company recently started very structured efforts towards Brand, Culture, and Values.

Besides taking action against the engineer involved, we are doing an exhaustive review to identify improvements in our audit and monitoring systems. Meanwhile, some new technical SOPs and escalation processes are now in place to ensure any complex cases such as this is escalated and handled properly. Most of the external outgoing emails are tracked and logged as part of our monitoring policy but certain teams weren’t part of the policy due to the rare use of their emails for external communication, we are now extending the policy to ensure ALL external outgoing emails are tracked and logged. 

As for the people part, it's already one of our KEY targets for 2018 to further professionalize our functions from people and processes aspect. We have recently hired a top-notch HR director to improve the hiring process and address the pain points felt by hyper-growth companies when hiring fast as well as onboarding and training aspects. We already do trainings but to focus further we hired a team of two dedicated trainers seeding a small ""training organization"" within an organization focusing just on training. Training i.e. both general training and departmental training. The team will give much detailed attention to Culture and Values part. We are soon announcing the onboarding of a ""Been there done that"" Veteran, and this is particularly important as we are about to expand our hiring in the European region.

Our GDPR efforts have already helped in streamlining quite a few things. We worked with a professional firm in Q4 2017 and Q1 2018 to achieve initial compliance and currently working on an extended roadmap to strengthen further. As for the Security of our Platform, we have adequate measures in place, to improve further we signed an agreement with BugCrowd in Q1 2018.

While we would do more technical efforts, the real thing will be to ensure human integrity and ethics, as we all agree that these systems ultimately rely on the ""human"" part. For which key efforts as mentioned above are already in action.

At Cloudways we are committed to delivering a secure and reliable platform to our customers and become a partner in their growth. Our consistent NPS rating of over 60 shows how much love exists for Cloudways and we are committed to ensure this score goes up as we go forward. With the support of our customers and the feedback from users who help us by identifying areas for improvement, we are certain to reach our intended goals.",1529092877.0

B. You can change domain nameservers (DNS) to AWS system. In such case, domain control would be from AWS system. DNS change takes from couple hours up to 24\-48 to propagate in the whole web. After the nameservers would be changed, you would still have to set A or CNAME type record.

StrongestCoffee,"for webhosting I would stay away from all EIG companies 

for domain registration I would recommend porkbun, namecheap, google domains, ghandi, namesilo, internet.bs, uniregistry

most of the registrars offer free WHOIS protection

for SSL some domain registrars and hosting providers offer it for free using letsencrypt.

Now this is what I would recommend for a setup and it is the current on that I use. 

your domains should be registered with a company the speciaises in domains and not hosting. you should only use them for your domains and that is it. The reason for this is that problems occur with payments and cancellation. and if anything happens you would lose the domain. another thing is to not login to many times to the domain registrar and make sure that it is the most secure thing since if you lost any thing else (Hosting, DNS, email) you can always change it in the domain NS settings, but if the domain is lost you are screwed. 

So what I have is my domain NS points to Cloudflare since I use the DNS settings from them, hosting (one with GitHub pages, another with buyshared.net) and email using gsuite since email is very important to me and I don't trust cpanel that much with my host.

so with this setup if anything fails (example hosting) I just go to Cloudflare and change the DNS to a different host. and if Cloudflare fails (not probable at all) I just go to my domain and change the NS settings. 

but to conclude please make sure that where your domains are located that you have it secure and make sure that you have proper billing info since you dont want to lose the domains. another thing is use a different email for the domains so that you dont miss any notifications.

nid0,"First off, i'm going to touch on your use of the word ""passive"" in your first sentence - Reselling hosting services, and even less-so providing hosting via AWS or another VPS provider, is not in any way ""passive"".

In both cases you have all the responsibilities and workload that comes with running your business and providing support for your clients, if you go the reseller route the support provided by your host is there to deal with service problems you have with your reseller service, when one of your resold users can't get their mail working that's on you.

In the case of the AWS option, Amazon (or whatever provider you use) are responsible for ensuring the infrastructure to run your VM is functioning, beyond that everything is entirely on your shoulders.

If you're genuinely after *passive* income from hosting, what you need is an affiliate scheme with a halfway decent host to refer customers to them - Your clients then become that hosting provider's clients directly, you get your kickback, and no actual work to do.

If you are really going the reseller route, there're two main points:

1) Not all reseller services are created equal - Some providers of reseller services are terrible and some are great, so the resources you get from your money can vary dramatically.

2) Overselling - Most resellers are effectively overselling the service provided by their host, using your example if you as a reseller are provided with 60GB of storage you might offer your customers 10GB each but in the hope their average usage will only actually be 2GB, meaning you can fit 30 of those users into your account, rather than 6.

In terms of hosting yourself but using someone else's infrastructure, AWS is a complicated and relatively expensive way to go about it. You might want to look into Lightsail (still AWS, but their simplified VPS service) or the likes of DigitalOcean/Linode/Vultr - Bandwidth concerns generally go out of the window here because these machines have flat-rate pricing that provides several TB per month of traffic, when providing shared hosting you're generally going to run into other resource limitations long before you exhaust the bandwidth limits these usually provide.",1528287591.0

I have a different experience in that it never mattered who or how reffered my clients, because at the end of the day they would ALLWAYSE come back to me first and it was still a hasstle, and I could effectively loose reputation the same way by not helping, because most clients don't even know how to navigate to the help/chat options of a host, or if they do, they still don't know the right questions to ask! 

I found that switching to a reseller was the best decision I made looking back 7 years of putting together websites. 

Now, hosting is a saturated market, and I don't think it's profitable or cost affective to compete in anyway. BUT, if you know the ins and outs of your reseller, and you are hevilly invovled with each client and you cherry pick the right projects, it CAN be passivly profitable in way that all your customers are also clients you helped so you can ensure that ALL the websites on your reseller are top notch/safe/efficient so you don't have to worry about it.

I found a great balance in taking on customers who have no need or idea of what cpanel is, they just want a little WordPress website to log into, I even turn down projects if I can tell the person is high maitrnce e.c.t. and I don't pubically advertise or anything.

The downside is that business is really slow and I have to work a full time job, but at least I have the best possible customer base that makes it possible to do work full time until I can eventually switch sides of the fence as I keep adding one customer at a time (+a big bonus since each customer is basically a client I had to design a website for that was paid/billed selreatly from the reocurring charges)

I guess it depends on everyone's goal. Mine is not to get wealthy, I just want to be a loaf and not have anyone tell me where or when I need to be somewhere, and to work for myself, all I need to accomplish that is about $1500 monthly, so I'm slowly making my way there :) ",1528354045.0

peopleshost,"*Wow* is right, to the GD employee response by gd480..  


You **definitely** wouldn't want to set up aliases or redirects if you're looking to host multiple websites. Aliases would be if you wanted to use a secondary domain URL to go to your main domain URL when that secondary domain URL is typed in the browser. For example, [yourdomain.com](https://yourdomain.com) is your main website and you purchase [yourdomain.net](https://yourdomain.net) (.net version of the domain). If the .net version of that domain is typed, the visitor would be taken to the .com.   


If you're on GoDaddy's Starter plan, you won't be able to ""addon"" another domain to your existing hosting account via cPanel. They'll up\-sell you to another one of their plans. This is also assuming you aren't on one of their legacy (Linux) plans without cPanel.  


To host multiple websites you'll need to either 1) upgrade to another plan that supports addon domains or 2) look for another hosting provider that allows addon domains on their lowest/basic plan.

With cPanel, you would locate the **Addon Domains** icon to add another domain to your hosting account\-\-GoDaddy has this hidden/disabled on Starter package so you can't host multiple domains on that plan. You would then need to make sure your ""addon"" domain's DNS is updated to point to your hosting account's nameservers.",1528310050.0

RandyHoward,"> I don't know if I'm being irrational, but I want to know the risks involved before I make a decision on starting a website

You might be being a little irrational. If someone *really* wants your information they can get it pretty easily, even if you can't easily find it through a google search. You will never completely mitigate the risk of someone with malicious intent trying to find you or your family. Remember, there are still phone books being published that list everybody's name and address in them, the internet is not the only place this info is readily available.

That said, unless you are planning to run a site that is unethical, immoral, or illegal, or otherwise appears to be any of those things, then I really wouldn't let this stop you from starting a website. You can register your domain name with privacy so if you're that concerned you will want to pay for the privacy features offered when you purchase your domain. That will mask your information on the whois records of the domain - so that if someone needs to contact you about your website (for legality purposes, such as copyright infringements or the like) then they will get the third party's contact info which will ultimately get forwarded to you.

2. Legal notice: In countries like f.e. Germany each website is required to have legal notice with enough data that allows a user to contact the owner.

peopleshost,"As others have recommended, if you're hosting mulitple sites a VPS may be something you want to consider. Many ""Reseller"" plans such as offered through HostGator are oversold on resources (Resellers tend to put way more sites/clients/customers on their ""Reseller"" plans abusing resources, which in turn affects other Reseller customers).   


VPS plans come bare metal or fully managed (cPanel/WHM). Just depends on your host and what their offerings are.

If you're using any sort of Backup plugins or Scanning/Security plugins, make sure you've got those all configured properly.   


Plugins such as Wordfence cause very high resource usage (mainly CPU) on a shared server if you're running multiple instances of Wordfence scans on multiple sites, multiple times throughout the day.  By default, Wordfence scans multiple times throughout the day, which is unnecessary since most legitimate web hosts scan customer accounts and sites already. You can still enjoy features that Wordfence offers (e.g., protecting login page), but scanning maybe once a week is really all you need.  


**Recommendation:** Disable automatic scans and check the option for ***low CPU usage scanning*** in the performance settings.

I've seen GoDaddy do this as well. The simple solution, though, is to not use their domain parking page. I'd expect most domain registrars to do this, even though I hate that they do. This is why it is important when possible to set your DNS while ordering the domain, so that it never shows these ad pages.

I actually complained to GoDaddy once when they took control of a domain I paid for because I didn't confirm the contact details. For two months, one of my domains was running ads and lost SEO. I hadn't noticed until I did a domain audit and checked all the domains I own and control. I told them I wanted the ad revenue they generated from it, and they said they had no way of knowing how much was made (BS).

bhnobody,">attorneys being able to ""prove"" that I'm a domain squatter

For the purposes of this response, I'm going to assume the above happened in a UDRP proceeding. 

If your newly-registered domain includes a trademarked term, you're already in an uphill battle to retain ownership of it in UDRP proceedings. However, I've seen some UDRP defenses reference a previous UDRP decision (I don't recall which specific one) that found that if your host/registrar put up the monetized parking page, then that can't be a factor in a determination of bad faith registration. If you do your own UDRP responses, you should take the time to find that decision. If you have a lawyer do your responses, they aren't earning their pay if they don't include that decision in their argument. If you didn't respond to the UDRP, then of course you lost.

Again, like I said, it's still an uphill battle. You'd need to do other things like show an existing business that uses the term in order to prove you have a legitimate claim to the domain. One of the domains owned by a customer at my former employer had ""intel"" in their domain name and Intel went after it in a UDRP. That customer was able to show legitimate use of the domain and Intel lost the claim, so it's definitely possible.",1527622523.0

nid0,"This is actually one of those few scenarios on this sub where getting yourself a VPS could be worthwhile.

It sounds like your technical needs are straightforward in the extreme, given that you literally just need a static file hosted and a way to upload it.

$20/month gets you a DigitalOcean or Linode droplet that provides 4TB of transfer per month. If you're using approximately 1TB after Cloudflare takes off most of the heavy lifting, this broadly means you can increase your downloads around 4x, at what is still a fairly minimal cost.

The setup is straightforward, if you aren't comfortable installing a basic webserver able to serve a static file, there are services around that hook into these droplets free of charge to provide basic GUI management.

The better answer though, is stop distributing a static file to your users yourself and provide them with a torrent link instead. Your workload is exactly the kind of thing that suits P2P distribution of the data (it isn't being CDN'd live during a page view, you're distributing it to fans/supporters who're likely more technically capable than most so should be able to run a torrent client, etc), and it'll reduce your bandwidth usage to almost zero.",1527546394.0

ollybee,"  1Tb a month is not that much, especially if it's evenly spread over the month. For larger hosts that run their own network bandwidth limits are only really to stop abuse as most people who are trying to use lots of bandwidth are attempting something silly that will cause issues for the host \(legal threats , DDOS etc\). If you email some hosts and explain or even just point them to this post I suspect you would find someone who would host this on a cheap plan.  

I would say this does sound like a perfect use case for some kind of distributed sharing such as ipfs or as a torrent. There are web based torrent clients running ion the browser that use WebRTC which would make it easy for your users.",1527604991.0

It's awesome because you don't have to worry about traffic, and they also don't require a ""hosted by github"" or anything like that.  
  
The downside to this is it will take some learning. You'll need to learn how to use git a little bit, and also would need to build your website from scratch. However, there are many static site generators that can help a lot with the latter.

antonivs,">I want the website to be accessible by anyone in the world, with a normal domain, not localhost

For that to work, you'll either need a fixed IP address at home, or if your provider only gives you a dynamic IP \(which is typical\), you'll have to set up something that maps your domain to the dynamic IP. Services like [DynDNS](https://dyn.com/remote-access/) can do that. \(It's also possible just to give users a URL containing your public IP address and port number, which would look something like http://99.99.99.99:8080/\)

To allow external users to access a machine on your home network, you'll need to open up ports on your firewall. Typically your ISP's router will have menu options to set that up, e.g. on mine under Firewall there's an option to set up hosted applications \- you have to tell it the IP of your local machine on your network, and the port number for the app on that machine.

You'll either need a different port number for each app, or else you'll need something which routes requests to the correct app. Having a different port number for each app means you don't need any other components. Otherwise, you'll probably want some sort of web server front end layer, like nginx, but that adds more learning curve.

The above steps are all you need to do at a high level just to get it working.

However, as other people pointed out, security is not something you can safely ignore. Within as little as a few hours of opening a port on the internet, you'll probably start getting requests from bots probing for weaknesses. If your apps are hosted on your own machine, there's a not\-insignificant chance that your machine could become infected. It's *possible* to ensure that your app is secure, but unless you're paying close attention to e.g. [Express and NodeJS vulnerabilities](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/security-updates.html), it's easy to miss something and get owned.

One easy way to protect against this would be to run your apps in a virtual machine \(e.g. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), Windows' built in VM support, KVM or Qemu on Linux\). That way, any compromise to your apps won't affect the host machine. You could also use a Docker container if you're already familiar with that, but if not, a VM is likely to be easier.",1526927112.0

you could run in to problems copying the files directly as the maildir and files inside it need to have specific permissions, which could get overwritten if you go this route, so watch out for that. there is a tool in cpanel/whm to correct the permissions of a user's maildir... but it's in the WHM panel, so you would need access to that (or, again, ssh access to run the script directly at `/scripts/mailperm`).

this is really awkward to do without shell access. i think the best thing to do would be to back up the user's maildir on the new host, compress the maildir on the old one, download that and reupload it to the new host and decompress it into the appropriate location. if you do that without overwriting the old files, it will hopefully not mess up the permissions.",1526812491.0

hostens,"If you plan of going with the transfer, there are couple steps general for all of websites:

A. Make a backup. If you are transferring between servers with same control panels, it should be possible of generating one single backup for all of the data. However if the control panels will be of different types, then the best way would be to prepare backups separately, for website files, databases and e\-mail.

B. When you have the backup prepared, it would be best to contact the new service provider, it should have detailed guide on how to transfer website to their system, with information about their specified file directories for website files and e\-mail. Take specific precaution with database upload and if control panels will differ, my recommendation would be of creating a new database and import the database via phpMyAdmin \(or it's alternative\).

C. After transfer, check your website config files since there is 99&#37; chance that you will have to adjust the user details for connecting to the database, since it will be different in the new provider's system. Also, if the route to files on the server differs, it can be required to adjust the routes on the database itself \(for example wordpress wp\_options table\).

D. If everything seems fine, point domain to the server while adjusting the domain zone.

P.S. For the transfer guide that I have mentioned in part B, you can ask the provider before ordering the service if the provider has such transfer guide. You can also check with the provider, maybe it could transfer the website for you and you would not need to get involved ;\)",1526539121.0

I find supporting nonprofits can be a double-edged sword. Unless they are the level of the Susan G Komen Foundation, then don't worry about the budget. However nonprofits need to know exact monthly charges so they can budget that and get funding. Also nonprofits typically do not employ people who have a corporate background where o365 is used more often. So, changing the world on them has a huge risk of damaging their culture of operations. You are also, in my opinion spending too much effort on a non-profit that is more than likely nowhere close to the Susan G. So you can only squeeze the orange so much. The best thing to do is keep it simple and keep it crazy affordable for them in hopes that they will tell their board members who are usually business owners in the community of how much good you have done for them. Then, they will hopefully get you to support their business. Or, do what I do and receive an in-kind donation for the services I give the nonprofit, so I can write it off as a tax deduction.

At this point, i'd say:

- Enable caching on the webserver

- monitoring mysql queries and look for queries taking long time to run

- make sure you're not getting crawled by random bots

- enable cloudflare for DNS and caching (if really needed)

OriginalSimba,"Typically you would email abuse@whoever.com when you want to contact their fraud and abuse department.

Some corporations will change abuse@ to something else. Those corporations are dicks. Abuse@ has been the internet standard for decades. The people who change it are those who want to make it difficult for you to report fraud, so you have to dig through 20 pages of FAQs and knowledge-base crap on their terrible websites to find the address.

One quick method is to do a WHOIS of their domain. All domain owners are required to maintain accurate contact information on their WHOIS record, and while they're only required to supply 1 address, there are options for abuse reporting and most ""good participant"" organizations will include an E-mail contact in those records.

Typically, you can just shoot an E-mail to abuse@ and only worry about it if your first attempt bounces back as undeliverable.

Some corporations, such as Endurance International, believe that the rules do not apply to them and will send you a response telling you they ignore all emails sent to their fraud department.

OriginalSimba,"Here goes....

First, your ISP will very probably shut off your service if you start hosting a website. That is usually in their terms of service. You can often get away with a _private_ site, one that you don't publicize and maybe even operate on a non-standard port, but a public-facing port 80/443 site is going to land you in hot water unless they explicitly allow it. I have seen ISPs throttle customer connections, even after saying they don't do that. They do.

if your site is for business, lease a $5 VPS from Digital Ocean. If you're just hosting a blog, rent a sandbox VPS from vultr for $2.50/mo. However Digital Ocean's terms of service are much more customer-friendly.

Do not use a pi for a website. Pi's are really cool and sure it could serve a site, especially a static HTML site, but it's not going to perform like you want. It's a proof of concept. You can buy a really capable system with like 4gb of ram super-cheap if you look around at refurb shops and places like [Free I.T. Athens](https://freeitathens.com). I got a system with dual-core CPU and 4gb for $15 from the shop I linked, which is plenty of power for your purposes. 1GB of ram is plenty, that isn't the problem. The problem is the CPU power of the pi.

Forget DDoS. If you're running a server from your home and you get DDoSed, you're screwed. Make sure your router is capable of using the Advanced Tomato firmware, install it and use the 'MAC Spoof' feature to change your mac address if you get DDoSed. This changes your IP and will fix your internet connection, and when the DDoS is exhausted you can change your DNS and resume service. DDoSes are paid-for mercenary services so chances are unless you piss someone off nobody is going to attack your site, and even then it's only going to last as long as they are able to pay for. Probably minutes, hours at most. MAC Spoofing can also fix a throttling issue if your ISP black-marks your address. Don't even think about hosting a home-server unless it's behind a Tomato router.

Lastly, Oh boy... forget about control panels. Learn to do it right. You need to ensure your firewall is working and then install and configure fail2ban. These are not simple things. What you're trying to do is not simple, it's the realm of system engineers. It's a great learning experience, for certain.

If it's not obvious, I'm telling you not to host your website on your residential internet connection. Even if you don't get into trouble it will suck ass. ""100mbps"" might sound like a lot and indeed for what people usually do it is, but the _full performance picture_ of a residential connection is never going to compare to a real datacenter with few-hop gigabit internet connections. What you want to do can be done however, and I hope my suggestions have helped.

dance-the-manta-ray,"You live in a college town? You can probably find a used computer for free or near to.  Wordpress is a heavy application. Mysql likes a lot of memory.  I'd find a box with at least 4G. Old Dell workstation/servers are easy to come by and very reliable.

10k visitors per day?  That's a lot of traffic.  If you have a production site that currently gets that amount of traffic, I wouldn't suggest moving it to a home server set up. You might saturate your own connection, and wont likely be able to offer the download speed to your visitors that you would be able to if you host your site at a datacenter.

If you are determined to home\-host and need the ability to serve 10k visitors per day you're going to want a web cache/reverse proxy in front of your application server.  nginx, squid, or varnish.  You'll probably want to mysql on its own machine and then apache and your proxy on another, but you can run all 3 programs all on the same machine. I only use home setups for testing/thinkering \(I highly recommend as it is just plain fun to do\).  Sometimes I'll offer what I'm working on through ngrok, but I never open my home ports.

ngrok is an ssh tunnel service that allows you to make any port on your computer available from the internet via a temporary IP address/dns name.  It is great for showing off the current project on your machine/laptop.  It also allows you to monitor and replay requests \(super handy for testing and debugging REST APIs and AJAX\).  It's a free service but they have a very cheap month to month plan \(with prorating!\) if you want to some extra features: the ability to use your own domain names, full ssh tunnel \( client \<\-\> ngrok \<\-\> laptop\) and other stuff I can't recall.

Once I'm confident with where I'm at with the site/service, I'll move it to a VPS provider. I use Digital Ocean and I highly recommend their service, but Linode and Vultr are also very popular.  A cool thing about Linode is you can install any system you want.  You're given full control of your VPS.  Digital Ocean only offers a hand full of systems but... they're the most common Linux flavors. They also come with a couple of simple tools pre\-installed that give you some nice dashboard features within your Digital Ocean admin page.  CPU/memory graphs etc.

A lot of people \(tech blogs and books\) will recommend AWS, Google Cloud, and other PaaS solutions.  IMO these are overkill for the vast majority of projects, lead to vendor lock, overpriced, and force you to cede too much control of your project to the company hosting it.  If you learn to configure and run your own system on a VPS, you will have full control of every aspect of your operation, and can easily move to the most competitive VPS provider at the time.  Also, all that time you put into learning how to interface with a proprietary system could be spent learning how to use free, universally available tools.",1526227507.0

I always purchase backup offered by DO or Linode.  Note that DO only backs up weekly while Linode backs up nightly.  

For a backup to be useful for a restore, we need to have database dumps available (if the site has a database).  We have a cron which dumps the database and then deletes any dumps which are over 2 weeks old to keep the disk from filling up. 

If I need to restore an image, I restore it to a fresh container / droplet / VM and work with the data there. 

In addition to this, we use PIT restore which allows us to take advantage of AWS S3's versioning feature. Every night, we use PIT restore to backup the delta (changed files only) to S3. If something goes wrong, we can use a command line tool to recover the entire contents or specific files of the site to a specific date.  PIT restore can be found here: https://labs.madisoft.it/amazon-s3-point-in-time-restore/

exitof99,"Funny thing, I recently migrated a long-time friend's website from IX Web Hosting to my hosting company. He has been an eBay seller since the early days, and amassed about 60 GB of shop images.

He originally called me because of an issue getting SSL on the domain, but after I took a look, it turned out that IX told him that he was also using too much space, so someone handling things for him previously moved the 60GB to Frantech. This genius that set this up, though, created a duplicate set of A records on the DNS Zone, so that the DNS pointed to both the IX and Frantech servers.

It took me about an hour before I realized why I could see an image and someone else couldn't. So rather than deal with the archaic H-Sphere web servers with IX, I migrated his accounts over a few months ago.

When I went back to IX to ensure the domain transfers went through, I was told the account was moved to Site5, and realized that EIG acquired IX. Boy, I was sure glad I did all of before the IX to Site5 migration, what a mess it would have been otherwise.

The only thing that I was happy about was that I was able to generate a complete backup via cPanel after the migration, just to be sure I have a complete archive of the old server files.

But for your situation, unlimited it a lie, and you should know better than to trust in something so obviously a sales gimmick. If you really need to store 30GB of files online, then you should be prepared to pay for a hosting plan that actually allows for it, like a VPS plan or cloud-based hosting that charges you based on your usage if it exceeds specific limits.

By trusting in ""unlimited"", you are allowing yourself to continually face issues of hosts deleting files, suspending your site, or just complaining until you go away.

As for the migration to Site5, I'm guessing you too had the H-Sphere servers with IX, so migration to the cPanel servers most likely was done using custom scripts that don't completely transfer everything over.

In some cases, it might be impossible to transfer over everything, like maybe FTP users, because the password hashes could be different and not usable on the cPanel server. I'm not sure on this, though, as they were able to transfer the account password over somehow, but maybe it is because the authorization is taken care of by their own system and not cPanel.

As for databases, yeah, if you haven't created a backup prior, you are screwed in that case. The best you can try and do is try to repair the database in cPanel.

As for the fancy indexing, you can control that in your .htaccess file. It is off by default on cPanel servers because it is a security risk to give anyone access to list files in folders. You should keep it this way and selectively enable listing on the folders that should have it.

miakeru,"Expiration dates get artificially pushed back a year as they enter the redemption period and later are pending deletion. This will go away when the domain is deleted. It has to be extended like this so that the domain just doesn’t disappear entirely on the expiration date, but gives you an extra 60 days to redeem and renew the domain. This is usually quite expensive (over $100 for the redemption, plus the cost of a yearly renewal).

I’d recommend pulling your email receipt showing your two year renewal or finding a copy of this in their billing system for proof. You can also look at your bank statement for that time period and compare the charge from that company to their yearly cost of registration for your domain.

JoshDargie,"Hello @sonnytron

Firstly thank you for your feedback, as Operations Manager for GreenGeeks, it saddens me to hear you had so many complications in your initial onboarding period. I'd like to thank you for at least giving us a shot, and for taking a step towards being eco-friendly with your website. If you don't mind, however, I'd love to address these concerns publicly as I believe a lot simply stems from frustration/unrealistic expectations which if addressed may help others in the future. 

**1. cPanel kept timing out when I actually had time to set up my site.** 

As you indicated, when our support team receives information about customers experiencing intermittent connectivity related issues we immediately begin to investigate any IP blocks within our firewall. With our platform, we take website and server security seriously, and as such our threat analysis systems are configured on the sensitive side. IP Blocks can occur from anything ranging from Mod Security rules being triggered to port scanning to other proprietary checks we have in place.  Our support team should be investigating these issues by obtaining your IP Address and reviewing our network logs to determine any flags and provide instructions on how to avoid triggering these alerts. 

Unfortunately, if the offending activity isn't curbed then you would continually experience intermittent connectivity related issues. That said, this shouldn't be a deal breaker and can easily be resolved. 

**2. Even now, LetsEncrypt is in 'beta' and you have to request it manually.** 

GreenGeeks was behind the curve with respect to offering Let's Encrypt and we fully recognize this reality (https://www.greengeeks.com/blog/2018/05/01/free-lets-encrypt-wildcard-ssl/). Unfortunately, unlike many web hosting providers who utilize a single cPanel server and then deploy websites on it, we have a more advanced platform. As a result, when Let's Encrypt was originally announced providing only single domain certificates we determined that in its current configuration it would cause nothing but problems both for our customers but also for our staff managing the service.

We had been in active communication with the Let's Encrypt team pushing them to deploy a wildcard solution which they announced late last year with a target of deploying during Q1 of 2018. Upon confirmation of this news, we immediately began developing a solution that could be integrated into our already developed One Click SSL application for our premium SSL certificates.

In March we announced our early beta for Let's Encrypt which focused on customers who would pass the DNS verifications checks without complication (read: customers with their domains pointing to us). In April we introduced this as an open beta accepting any customer configuration including those who host their domains DNS outside of our network. For the month of May we are still requiring customers to contact us to request the deployment. I can certainly understand how this can seem outdated, however, this is a result of us working to perfect the implementation to seamlessly deploy for both our Reseller and Shared hosting customers alike. 

In addition, we expect by the June to have this process completed and have automatic deployment enabled for all customers. We thank our customers for their patience as we worked through this deployment process. 

With respect to customers utilizing CertBot, unfortunately, your comments are inaccurate. We have had customers for over the last 2 years utilizing tools such as CertBot or other third party scripts/services to deploy Let's Encrypt SSLs on our platform. SSH Access is of course required and is provided free of charge to all customers. We don't provide technical support/assistance however for CertBot and these other third-party tools which may be where the confusion lies. 

**3. You have to request a support ticket for SSH access.**

GreenGeeks provides SSH access by default in an enabled state for our Shared Hosting customers. We do recommend and require customers to utilize SSH Keys to access their SSH service with this being changed to password authentication for customers who contact us and are struggling to deploy their own key pair. For our Reseller Hosting customers, this service is turned off by default however as a reseller you have the ability to enable this from inside your Web Host Manager portal.



In conclusion, I know you had a terrible first start. I'd love to work with you to resolve any of these concerns if you were interested in utilizing our service. If you would be willing to work with us, reach out in a private message with your domain or email address on file with us and our Customer Success team will be in touch.

mdaffin,"Twice the number of servers doubles the chance that something will break. But you will only break half your sites at once - which is not much of a bonus if things are breaking twice as often and twice and much to maintain.

If you are only interested in cost then run the numbers and see which is cheaper there is little point is spreading things out horizontally without a proper HA solution in place if it is more expensive to do so.

You should consider a proper HA solution to reduce the risks of a node failure once you have decided that scaling horizontally is a viable option. It is more work to setup but reduces the risks of failure especially as you need to add more nodes.

Personally I like running things on pay per hour VPSs like AWS, Google cloud or digital ocean as you can start to auto scale things on demand to reduce the overhead of over provisioning nodes to account for spikes in traffic (if you have spikes in traffic) while keeping things HA to protect against failure of nodes. But this can be more initial work to get up and running.",1525344627.0

To touch on the HA solution being mentioned, those are beneficial primarily for larger individual sites, not necessarily multiple smaller sites, however you would want to make sure you need a more complex setup like that and not something more on the simple side of things. ",1525348621.0

You'll need to setup either an A record, or a CNAME. Since you're likely a shared hosting customer, the CNAME will be the easiest.

This makes the subdomain 'work' and point to that domain name. Now here's the part where I don't know and depends on your provider.

You may have to setup a parked domain / addon domain / subdomain within your control panel for it to route properly.

If you're using cPanel then you can simply setup a subdomain and have it's document root point to public_html/service/

Then anyone that visits sub.domain.com loads from the service folder.

Alternatively yes, you can use a 301 htaccess redirect to redirect sub.domain.com -> domain.com/service/

It completely reconfigures the system with non-standard install paths and what does it actually provide you except for some candy-colored buttons? cPanel is a toy used to convince people that the Do-It-Yourself service they're paying for isn't a ripoff.

Pro-tip, the Do-It-Yourself hosting services are all ripoffs.

There's two kinds of hosting customers. People who like system administration, and people who don't. If you like system administration, learn to do it right. Learn the CLI, or use a standards-compliant control panel like Webmin. And if you don't like system administration, find a real managed hosting provider, one that actually manages everything for you, so you don't need to.

cPanel costs _at least_ $20 per server. So the only time you're ever going to get it at an affordable rate is with Shared Hosting, and Shared Hosting is always hot garbage, so not worth it. And if you get cPanel on a VPS it's going to raise your monthly cost by at least $20. Not worth it again.

Many of these companies like Hostgator and bluehost had management that started the brand, know hosting, were in the trenches and did support and system administrator. They knew hosting. It is hard to find good staff, that know their shit - want to work in the hosting industry - and don't own a company already. This is why hostgator used to pay $10,000 to people who could help them successfully find a system administration (and another 10k signing bonus).

Also, keep your hosting and domain registrars separate. I personally prefer NameCheap, AWS, or Google for domains.

Transferring a domain doesn't have any fees but what you may notice is that they do charge you during the transfer for an extra year for your domain so if you domain expires on Dec 15 2015 and you transfer it the registrar will add an extra year to make it expire dec 15 2016 and they do not charge a fee. on the other hand some TLD do not charge and when you transfer it keeps the same expiration date.

If you guys are a small startup baking company, I doubt you'll break either of those limits.  In the future, if you notice yourself starting to push close to the 30GB monthly bandwidth, it's very easy to transfer away (and you wouldn't be losing much money (in paid for, but unused time) either, because the hosting is $1/month).  

If you worry that wouldn't be enough for you, you've got two options.  SiteGround ($3.95/month for your first purchase, jumps to $9.95 with 10/20/30% discounts/year).  They give you shared hosting and offer support.  DigitalOcean is another good option ($5/month).  Fantastic speeds.  They've got a one-click install set up for Wordpress, but if you aren't using Wordpress you'll need to do a bit more configuration.

ColonialReddit098,"I think your misconceptions of VPS are wrong. The VPS' plans from shared hosting providers are crazy expensive and a bit of a rip off in my option . Your paying $30-40 USD for something that costs $5 a month . VPS that I'll recommend below are pay per hour so if you don't like the solution after setting it up and playing with it for a few hours, you can take it down and pay the few pennies it costs per hour.


Here is a solution. Check out cloud hosting from digital ocean , vultr and linode. They are basically baremetal servers but don't fret! It's not as complicated as it sounds. Here's what I would personally do.

You mentioned wanting to combine hosting and personal file hosting so lets look at a few options.

Digital ocean provides plans starting from $5 . This plan is incredibly robust for any site and features  25gb of storage , 1 vcore and 1GB of ram which is pretty good. 

Should you want more storage , you can dynamically  add storage blocks to your VPS which is basically $1 for 10GB of storage. If we want to go a bit deeper, Digital Ocean has a 'spaces' service which is 250GB for $5 a month . Spaces will work excellently with something like Nextcloud which you can install on your server.

To bind this all, you would want a system to manage your server for you. I recommend Runcloud as it handles all the maintenance for you and provides a nice GUI for controlling your server.

I personally haven't done this but feel free to share your thoughts.",1524473693.0

The large majority of providers out there won't allow bulk file storage on standard shared hosting accounts (and 50GB of content is likely to be beyond a lot of providers' ""we'll look the other way"" amounts) so you're already looking at a pretty thin selection of hosts.

Additionally, finding an inexpensive host that you're happy with is always going to be a struggle.

fender1878,"As others have pointed out, hosting is completely separate from your domain. As long as you pay for hosting, you’ll always have access to the file, email, etc. Even if your domain expires, you could still pay for the hosting account.

The analogy someone used about fuel and cars is perfect. I can buy a car, I can buy fuel. I can buy fuel without a car and a car without fuel. I could take that same fuel and put it in another car. 

The domain needs to point to your hosting account in order for businessname.com to link up with the files and emails on that server. If someone bought the domain, either: (1) the DNS still points to your server, so it’s only a matter of time before it doesn’t or (2) the domain points somewhere else and you just are accessing the hosting account. 

Important Note: once the DNS gets changed to that domain, you will stop receiving email, website traffic, etc. In fact, the person could create your same email accounts and begin receiving all of those messages to your domain on their server. This includes password resets. It’s vital that you start changing your access for all accounts tied to email addresses at that domain, immediately. Like get off Reddit and start doing that now.

but my question is... if the name was pointing to your etsy page the whole time, why buy hosting? All you need is a domain name registration and then point the DNS wherever you want, unless you need email too.

3e486050b7c75b0a2275,"- The person who owns the domain can point it to any server

- The server may choose to respond to requests for the site at that domain name. This is what the hosting company does when you buy hosting from them.

So if the person who bought the domain still has it pointed to your hosting your hosting is being put to use. The business of pointing a domain to a server is called DNS and changes to that can take 72 hours to propagate so it may take some time before you see changes the new domain owner has made there.

The hosting company doesn't check whether the domain is pointing to their servers or not before they let you renew hosting! 

Regarding the domain:

- It may never expire. It may be put up to auction and be bought by someone else. Since it has already been sold once it's quite likely the domain registrar will attempt to auction it again.


- Even if it goes through the expiry process it'll take longer than 2 months for it to expire. There is a 30 day grace period and a 30 day redemption period. 

- There are also some companies that automate the process of buying expired domain names. These are called drop catchers and they compete to grab premium domains as soon as they become available to the general public. Your domain may be purchased by one of them. You may have to put a backorder with one such company.",1524329581.0

nid0,"Initially I would point out that a 508 error generally isn't your host being unreliable or having downtime, it's you exceeding the resource allocation you're paying for - Most hosts use a system called Cloudlinux to limit the amount of CPU time and RAM an account is allowed to use at any given time, and a 508 error is what happens when you exceed this.

Have you therefore considered simply upgrading your account? You've implied that you originally bought Hostinger's cheapest account - They don't appear to specify clearly what CPU/RAM limits they apply to accounts, but their mid-tier account says it doubles your resources and the top-tier account says it doubles them again, so simply increasing the resources available to you may help.

You may also want to look into what plugins you have installed to your (presumably WordPress) install to check whether any of them might be un-necessarily using huge amounts of memory.

The main reason for this is that Siteground also limit your CPU/RAM usage in the same way, therefore if you go from Hostinger's smallest account to Siteground's smallest account, you may simply find Hostinger's 508 error gets replaced by Siteground's 508 error.

Unfortunately i'm not sure that Siteground actually publish up-front what their CPU/RAM limits are either, so comparing your requirements between the providers is going to mean asking Hostinger what resources they currently provide, and asking Siteground what their accounts provide - You simply need more resources, basically.",1523951220.0

redlotusaustin,"Are the custom name servers something provided by your old host, like ns1.oldhost.com, or are they custom nameservers based on a domain of yours, like ns1.yourdomain.com?

If they're the old hosts nameservers, then yes, you'll need to setup new nameservers on the new host and then update your clients' domains. The new host will most likely provide nameservers that you can use or you can setup some based on your domain name. Doing the latter would make it less of a hassle to move things in the future if you were ever to move again, since you would only have to change the IPs of the nameservers; all of your clients would still use ns1.yourdomain.com & ns2.yourdomain.com and they wouldn't even know that the IP addresses of those servers had changed.

As for your second question: yes, if an order is placed after the data has been transferred but before the DNS has changed, that order will be stuck in the old database once the DNS is changed. For these sites you are going to have to handle the final migrations yourself but you can still let the new host copy all the data over and get everything working, before you do that.

You'll need to drop the TTL for the relevant DNS for all of your clients so that, when you do make the DNS changes, they propagate quickly. Once that's been done properly, set the relevant sites to maintenance mode, disable them with a plugin or do something so that you know no more orders can be placed.

Any site that that relies on user data (i.e. orders, comments, public users) being stored in the database should be put into a ""maintenance mode"" (static html page saying, ""sorry for the inconvenience our site is currently unavailable do to scheduled maintenance"").

Once the site is in maintenance mode you can backup the DB and begin the transfer. once your site is transferred and your DNS is pointing at the new sever with the new DB customers will no-longer see the maintenance page.

If the host does not address these things, but specifies a number of databases you're allowed, look elsewhere.

Anyway to answer your question:

*  The domain name expiration date comes and the domain goes offline.
* 30-45 days pass while the domain owner can pay the registry a normal renewal fee to bring the domain back online.
* 30-45 days where the domain name owner can pay the registrar a ""redemption fee"" (Usually $100-300 dollars) to get the domain back. I believe part of this fee is paid to the registry depending on the TLD.
* The domain goes into pending deletion.  This can be 5-10 days long depending on the registrar. Keep in mind a lot of times during this period a registrar will send the domain to an auction site to allow someone else to purchase it.
* Domain has been deleted and is available for registration again. This is where a domain auto-grab service will auto-snag the domain for you.

My experience is that it takes a really long time to actually have a domain expire and slip away. They will send you months worth of “last chance” emails, allowing you to reclaim it (for a fee of course). 

Once the domain expires, it’s been my experience that there are overseas companies who get a list of expiring domains and poach them as soon as they’re available. My guess is that they’re looking to screw over the original owner if they choose to buy it back. I’ve seen a number of average $15 domains all of a sudden be for sale around $1500 once expired.

Cloudlinux really does improve the isolation of the cpanel users.

In which case you could simply spin up a VPS big enough for your sites, install Cloudlinux and keep your sites up to date. You'll be safe from most hacks.

craigleary,"A vps may not necessarily be faster than a reseller host. It always depends, resources like CPU and ram and your actual set up. I would say a vps from your current provider and digital ocean are probably very similar on the back end. Don't let the term cloud ""cloud"" your judgement. Most clouds are really VPS's and can scale. Digital ocean backend may be a little more advanced with an easier way to upgrade and quickly move your droplet to another hardware system, over your basic vps host generally keeping you on the same hardware. One possible issue with DO is that on an upgrade, you may move to hardware where the CPU is slower, or the system is more bogged down since they are so automated (but to their credit if you find this, and open a ticket they generally will work with you and move you again). 

As far as a vps, I don't believe you have the experience to go this route yet but since you appear to be a self learner its not too too difficult - you should have an admin available on this route especially on an unmanaged host. Someone with good experience for security - i'd recommend rack911.com if they still do single servers. Why? If you set up a basic cpanel/WHM install and do nothing else there is limited extra security, PHP is running as a cgi with out op code caching, there is no outbound spam protection - the list goes on. Each of these can be added, you can add mod_security rules, you can enable basic outbound spam filtering, you can install a good firewall that adds more security, you can turn off ssh password auth - again the list goes on. 

Next backups. You should be doing this no matter what, but on a vps you 100% are in control of backups. Your host is not. A reseller account should have backups you can fall back on. 

So my opinion: A vps may not necessarily be faster, it is more work, and performance wide most cloud companies are not offering much extra over a vps. When the whole cloud vs vps started, cloud was certainly a foggy area where the general belief was that cloud was able to automatically recover - like data on a san, hypervisors can automatically start up on new systems which was pushed by systems like onApp. But it turns out onApp wasn't really that good, amazon was growing huge and not offering this, DO came out and did the same - and this was too costly. Now cloud is really easily scaling and you are supposed to make your app redundant not the cloud provider. A system like cpanel doesn't really lend itself to such types of app fail over it must be done at the hypervisor level.


If you have a good host, and don't want to manage a vps reseller is great. You may want to consider two reseller accounts with different companies at least initially to test how good they are. A shared hosting provider with a focus on performance can be good. Or consider adding cloudflare CDN to speed up your sites.",1523631492.0

iworkinmybasement,"Ok, I've run a hosting company for the past 17 years... I see this all the time.

First, realize that not all shared hosting is horrible. Personally, I would advise looking for a company that is smaller but has a track record - aka not going to pull an overnight disappearing act. You'll likely get much better customer support (I may be biased there, but this is based on my experience looking at things as objectively as possible...) 

Next look for a hosting company that clearly tells you the resources your account will give you. The resources you really care about are the CPU/RAM/Disk space/speed. 

Plus you ideally want a provider offering some decent security, look for Cloudlinux or something similar to help with user isolation. Cloudlinux will not only prevent 1 hacked cpanel account on the server from infecting all the other cpanel accounts (cagefs is great), but will help ensure that 1 resource hogging cpanel account shouldn't really impact the performance of your account due to the resource isolation.

Then there is the fun performance stuff - do they run an alternate webserver (I prefer litespeed because it's a drop in replacement for apache but nginx can be really fast), do they utilize newer hardware, is the network decent, do they have anything else you can utilize (such as cache, etc).

Often, you may find that a reseller account or two is cheaper and more powerful than running a VPS.

That said, a VPS is a great option if you can find one with decent managed support. A managed provider will ensure everything is up to date and that when you DO run into issues that you can get the help you need in a timely manner. Because you will run into issues.

With a VPS you'll likely want to invest in things like cpanel and cloudlinux as well, which means you'll have to carry the license cost for those unless your provider bundles them for you. 

Never forget your backup strategy either, regardless of what route you decide to go with.

Finally, possibly consider offering a package that includes a WAF and CDN (reverse proxy) like Sucuri to help with security and performance. ",1523663001.0
theresapluginforthat,"If you are in this for the long haul and it appears as you are, going with a VPS solution from Linode or Digital Ocean, you will find the support that you need to get things up and running smoothly. Either through them directly or through other resources. 

Once you get the server set up, you can use Virtualmin / Webmin to assist in the management of the server and hosting accounts. This is a free open source supported tool. 

If you were to ever get stuck, you could reach out to the provider for assistance or you could find a sys admin person to take a look and see what is or is not happening. Then you can build a relationship with this particular person so that you can give him/her the issues as they arise allowing you to concentrate on growing your business.

I am not familiar serverpilot and how this relates to virtualmin/webmin. 

I think with going this route you'll find freedom in doing what needs to be done as well as being able to directly control the environment.

One other idea, if you wanted to start small, get a VPS for $10/month, get it set up and put a couple of sites on it and see how things go. Once you have the kinks worked out, you can upgrade the VPS and add more sites.

Our team has access to the same web console shown in your control panel.  If you've ever used it you'll notice that this console requires you to log in as a user on that machine in order to do anything.  Since we don't have those passwords we don't have access to anything while your droplet is running.  Our console access comes in handy for things like seeing boot errors and assisting in troubleshooting.

Your data is stored in a disk image and while some few people in engineering would have access to those disk image files our support team and pretty much everyone in the company does not.  We see snapshots and backups much the same way you do, just a name, date and size for the whole disk.

Now if, for instance we received a [legal order](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/enforcement/) with proper authority requiring us to hand over data this is usually just a matter of retaining that image file and providing it when legally obligated to.

I had a domain that was a single word that popped up in a number of business names. 

One was a small college that told all their students that their email addresses ended in my .com address. Another was a business that kept insisting they purchased my domain, and I was somehow committing a crime because their employees kept sending their email to me. I had owned the name for a few years before they claimed they registered it, and I was not in the same industry as them. In reality, they had registered and alternate address, but the admin just felt like they really should be able to use my domain because that was the one she really wanted.

I ended up not using a catchall for my use, but setting an autoresponder that informed the sender to make sure they were trying to reach my business, and not one of the others. This is a little sketchy these days, as autoresponders can be used as a reflector for spam.

MyWorkAccountThisIs,"There are usually two types. The first, is more of a marketing offering. It's not really managed it's more like it has WP pre-installed and a few thing pre-configured. Not bad. Usually not much more expensive that a regular shared hosting account.

The next is actually managed. My personal favorite is WP Engine. It's closer to Software As A Service. When you sign up WordPress is already installed. You can only run WP. The company will automatically update WordPress as soon as it comes out and will rollback the update if it notices a major problem.

That's the type of stuff you want to look for. You want a company that is fully invested in the WordPress platform - not a company that's just trying to cash in on the popularity of WordPress. Back to WP Engine, they actually will support your on WP problems. Like, you install a plugin and something doesn't work and they will help you isolate the issue. They won't go all the way to micro-manage and help you configure some random plugin though.

Really, it's hard to compare them all. But again, you want a place that actually offers full integration and support. Probably a place that only does WP hosting because they have an infrastructure that is 100% catered to it. You should expect to see them as part of the WordPress Dashboard when you're logged in.

Personally, and I fully accept I'm biased because I'm a developer, if a site means anything to you then you should put it in a place that will take care of it as best as possible.

_matthew,"If your company is using the web host also as an email host, this may have happened because one of your users flubbed their email password a couple of times. Perhaps the default security scheme on the account auto-blacklists IPs of users that make multiple attempts to log into the email server, which of course blacklists everybody in the company from getting their mail AND seeing the website.  I had this happen when I was using MediaTemple as a host.   There was a un-blacklist option in the control panel to address it when it happened, but they could not prevent it by whitelisting.  Ultimately I left MediaTemple because of it.

craigleary,"For multi tenant there are three main control panels that are commercial

 * cpanel/WHM - this is a staple. Its very stable, support is great - probably the best I have seen. The panel just works, its easy to install, and is now tightly integrated with even apache/php auto updating. You have less control over changes and modification and are held to what cpanel provides mostly. However it covers 95% of what you need. It has a basic wordpress installer. If you want ""authentic"" this is the way to go.

 * Directadmin - has most of the same features of cpanel. It also costs less. You have more control, can edit config files more in most cases with out being overwritten - it runs on many different os's - you can choose a lot of software versions yourself in their custombuild. Support is decent. If you want a panel that also just works, has 90% of what you need, and allows more control this is a great choice.

 * Plesk - a lot has changed in plesk and it looks a lot better. However: plesk has a way to go to win me back. First, their support has never been good, in fact it would be sub standard - 1 week response time used to be the norm. Plesk buys, and sells constantly. This company has changed hands many times. I have been burned by them letting software just rot (plesk billing), promising a multi server cluster to replace hsphere, almost delivering with plesk PPA and then selling that panel to Odin to be left high and dry. You may add this and have no upgrade path to another version. The company may sell more pieces of itself in the future. Their licensing is not simple, there are many choices and its ala cart unlike cpanel and direct admin. With that said: plesk supports windows and no other panel comes close on windows. Their linux product has greatly improved.

I use all of the above. cPanel would be my personal choice.


For others I see webmin mentioned. If you have the time, its possible. There is a learning curve. After you install this your next question will probably be - how do I configure mail on it. Unlike the above three, it will not install everything in the main install.

VestaCP interworx (commercial), server pilot I have not tried.

fender1878,"I totally get what you’re saying — one could just install a W/LAMP stack and be up and running. However, for someone like the OP who doesn’t seem well versed in this stuff + wanting to create separate hosting accounts for friends, cPanel with WHM is the best answer. 

A VPS license for cPanel/WHM is $14.95/mo, dedicated box is $34.95/mo. If you had a couple buddies and everyone pitched in a few dollars a month (which they should), it’s pretty nominal. Kick on auto-update and you have a fairly low maintenance setup. You’re not dealing with customers so your responsibility is fairly low.

Do not use addon domains for the multiple sites.

  * You are using CloudFlare. That's good (but check cache config)
  * Check in your .htacces if you are compressing (gzip/deflate) and what (no sense to do it with images)
  * Use WP-Smush to compress images.
  * Use ""Remove query string"" or similar plugin
  * Allow maximum cache on browsers and intermediates
  * Try to move to PHP7 if OVH ControlPanel allow  it
  * Try to move to nginx if OVH Control Panel allow it

craigleary,"Take review sites with a grain of salt. Here is my recommendation.

Look for hosts who have been around a while. 5+ years is a long time in webhosting and you eliminate fly by night companies. 10+ years is an eternity. 

Above someone says don't go with EIG. I tend to agree - until they really put effort into getting back to their old selfs and focus on customer service others are as good or better.

Keep your own backups. Its your data, you should have it. This will help you move to a new host if you need to.

Keep the domain name separate from the hosting company. In fact you can use outside dns, like cloudflare.com (which can speed up your site too) and easily move if needed.

Don't pay upfront at first. Go month to month, you want to know the service is good.

You need to keep your wordpress site updated, plugins/themes/core - sites that get hacked are usually due to this not the host. So if you see a review X host security is terrible I was hacked - translation is almost always that simple updates were not done.

Overall, hosting is not complicated. Your host responsibility is to keep the server up, hopefully good backups, keep the servers reasonably fast and respond reasonably to requests. Your responsibility would be to develop the site - your host doesn't develop the site for you and if they go out of their way to fix issues outside of this support scope that is a pretty good host - but don't rely on that.
",1522679565.0
Ekot,"A few rules to find a good host:

- Pick a company based in your own country (or the country that most of your websites visitors are from)
- Don't go with any company owned by EIG
- Check reviews

sumpdiddlyump_,"If you're comfortable with using the terminal, then the no-panel option is always going to be the best way to go from a performance perspective. But from a time perspective, using a panel is almost always better. Especially if you plan on hosting email and DNS zones.

My go to option for panels is always VestaCP. It's free, relatively easy to use, and very light on memory. You can also configure it to support Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates (just google ""vesta letsencrypt""), and it's compatible with PHP 7. It has some peculiarities that I find pretty annoying (you can't change the default username of the admin account!) but I've never really had any issues with it.

But if you do go the no-panel route, DigitalOcean and Linode both have a ton of great guides. You'll want to follow the LAMP set-up guide for databases and websites, and the Postfix-Dovecot virtual mail account guide for email.

For hosting, the best options are DigitalOcean, Linode, and Vultr. For a stock VPS, they're very similar, so any one of them would work. Since they're so cheap these days, I usually go for a 4GB VPS, but I never go lower than 2GB just because I like to have breathing room. However, it's a very easy process to upgrade the VPS on any of those services, so you could start at 1GB and just see how it goes. If you need to upgrade, it takes three clicks.

I can't answer on the last two questions. Never used Rails, and I've only used NodeJS once (FWIW, it's running on a server alongside Apache with dozens of sites with no issues).

hostens,"For transfering the domain to new hoster - contact your new hosting service provider and ask if it would support your domain on their system. for .com domains, most of service providers support, however if you have domain in another ending - it can be that the provider will not support the transfer of it. Also the hosting provider should be able of providing a guide or steps on how to issue transfer of the domain. Different domain types have different procedures required to be performed. 

The Registrant, admin and technical names should be changed if the transfer will be successful. 

Name server - server (at least 2). On these servers there is saved information about on which servers your domain website, e-mails are hosted. This information are saved in A, MX, CNAME and other various types of records. You can google DNS and DNS Zone for more information about this.

For the registrar part you are correct. This is where your domain is registered and where it's renewals are performed. If you transfer your domain to other service provider - this information will change.

For how to transfer the domain, I will repeat myself - it is best to contact the new service provider for information about the transfer. Different service providers can have different procedures and requirements, so it would be best that they would specify what will be required from you. When domain will be transferred, it should automatically be renewed too, but for this also - clarify with your new service provider.",1522416281.0
iceph03nix,"* Domain - should be your domain
* Registrar - The actual name of the company that has an ICANN account.  May or may not be the company the domain is registered with, as some will offer sub-registration for other companies
* Reg Date - the original date the domain was purchased on
* Exp Date - The date the current registration expires, and must be renewed before or it will go back on the market (usually you'll get like a 30 day window, but it's not good to count on)
* Upd Date - The last time the domain was renewed
* Status - whether or not there are any issues with the registration of the domain
* Name Servers - The servers that act as the primary control for you DNS settings, from which all other DNS servers will pull settings from.
* Contacts - There are numerous contacts, because in many cases, there will be different people in charge of different aspects.  For a private site, it will likely all be you, and you can usually just check a box to make them all duplicate.

As for moving: It's generally fairly easy if your registration and hosting are going to be with the same company.  It's mostly a game of confirming that the move is legit, so you'll need to be in contact with someone who has control of the current host.  It can vary a bit by host, but it generally goes something like this:

The current host needs to make sure the domain isn't 'locked'.  This is a security service available from some hosts that basically says they'll immediately reject any requests to move.

Then you will go to your new host, and request the transfer along with purchasing another year(or more) of domain registration.

Then all parties will likely get emails informing them of the request and possibly asking them to confirm.

Most hosts will be more than happy to help you with the transfer if it means getting your business.",1522424551.0

exitof99,"I started my own hosting company around 2006 because I was sick of trying to find a quality shared hosting provider. The last company I hosted with was JaguarPC, and at that time, they had their servers in a small janky data center on the East coast of the US.

This substandard data center claimed to have generators and a huge gas tank ready to spin up in the event of an electrical outage. Well, there was one outage for a short period, and then there was another shortly after that lasted over 24 hours - they blamed the fuel tanks being empty due to some reason or other.

I looked up information on the data center, and it looked shoddy. I saw the pictures of the fuel tank, but laughed because I realized they probably never actually filled it, just told people they did to save money.

It was then that I made the jump, grabbed a dedicated server at The Planet (which eventually became SoftLayer, and now is IBM Cloud). At that time, HostGator was not yet bought out and part of EIG, and they also had their servers in the same data center as my server.

Basically, for a relatively low cost, I had the power of a major data center behind my hosting. I also have a lot more confidence in the hosting I provide as I trust the data center.

Whether you are asking because you are interested in creating your own data center or co-locating with an existing small data center, keep in mind that the value of a legitimate data center. Data centers are complex and require constant monitoring by staff that can address issues immediately, that have their own stores of parts, that have redundancy in hardware and in network providers.

Going with a cheap data center might mean that you have a single point of failure in multiple spots, not enough hardware on hard for repairs, and greater potential for the whole data center to go dark for an extended period of time.

You could technically create your own data center in bedroom on a bunch of old laptops or stacks of Mac Minis and get a dedicated IP from your ISP. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.

Irythros,"You have two general options:  

1) Host them all on a single server/instance.  
2) Host each on their own.  
3) Both 1 and 2 at the same time (see below) 

The first has the benefit of lower cost and (generally) lower maintenance as if you want to upgrade server software you only need to do it on one server.  The drawback is you need to setup security properly so one compromised website won't be able to get the others.  

The second has the benefit of better security and you can give the site owner the logins.  The downside is cost and higher maintenance if you want to upgrade everything.  The maintenance part can be mitigated with a config management solution such as Ansible.  Another upside is more resources for each client so they get better load times.  

The third which is a mix between the two previous ones.  In this case you would get a single power instance / dedicated server and then install your own VM solution.  Each site now has resources which you can allocate, is separated by VMs, costs can be lower and is mostly an all around win.  The downside is VM software is either (somewhat) buggy or expensive.

I've done all three, and I'd recommend #2 if you can.

For email: Don't do it yourself.  Really.  This is a time sink.  **DO NOT** do email.  If I havent gotten my point across, DO NOT DO EMAIL.  

If they need an inbox like gmail provides, use Google Apps / Suits.  They get their own custom domain, the gmail inbox, gmail anti-spam and a whole slew of other features for $5/user.  There's also Office365 and some others that offer email like that.  

If they need to do transactional/marketing email, use something like Sendgrid.

VPS costs are monthly and a $20 VPS could do it for you. Serverpilot is free, but the $10 a month gives you user accounts for SFTP, support and one click SSL.

fender1878,"I own a website design and hosting company here in Los Angeles. I started in your boat and began hosting my clients. We now host close to 100 clients and contrary to some advice here, we do email as well. 

WordPress does best in a Linux environment. I’d avoid Plesk or AWS — isn’t work it. We host with LiquidWeb and they’re awesome. I’ve had my spin at BlueHost, HostGator, etc — those are terrible. When providing hosting to your clients, control is essential. When you use cheap shared hosting, you have zero control buy all the responsibility. Server down? Site down because your client used too many resources? Good luck dealing with your shared hosting company. Tech support is offshore, your client is pissed at you and there’s absolutely nothing you can do. 

We have 10 servers with Liquid Web and they were just as awesome when we had one little VPS. My biggest selling point with them is our servers are completely managed by their team. Sometimes a service goes down in the middle of the night and it has already been taken care of before I wake up. That piece of mind is crucial. Also, 99% of the time you get connected on Live Chat in less than 1-minute — to a real human in the USA. They also have awesome offsite backup features which got us away from backing up to AWS. Since they’re performing the backup, they can do an instant bare metal install of a server should something crash. 

Since you should be using Linux, get a cPanel server. You can manage everything including email from WHM. Your clients will have their own cPanel that you can brand and access email either via POP, IMAP or Webmail. It’s all pretty easy to navigate and you look like a pro. 

If you get a dedicated server or a VPS, you’ll have a software firewall with WHM called CSF+LFD. It’s easy to configure, robust and does a great job. 

Final point, if you’re serious about this. Get a VPS which gives you a lot of control, all the features you need and a decent price point. Provide all the services you can for your clients — and charge accordingly. ",1521960192.0

S3 is not a CDN. It's a storage service that does let you serve files out but they aren't being distributed across a CDN, you'd need to couple the service with CloudFront (assuming you want to stick with Amazon) for that.

Glacier is not suitable for your described needs. The point of Glacier is cold/warm archive storage for content you don't need to access much/at all, it's not designed for immediate retrieval and serving of content. Because of this, it's cheaper than ""Hot"" storage.

If you're just looking for an easy/straightforward solution and do actually want to couple your offsite storage with a CDN, Amazon is likely not going to be the most straightforward for you.

Pretty much any CDN service does provide a storage-based push service (where you can upload your content to them and it then gets distributed through their CDN) which will likely be an easier route.

redlotusaustin,"If you're really comfortable with day-to-day administration, my recommendation would be to go with a dedicated server with WHM/cPanel + CloudLinux + ConfigServer Firewall on it and WHMCS for billing/client management. With that setup, which is well documented, you can automatically provision accounts for clients, giving them their own cPanel login, which is completely isolated from all the other accounts on the server. There's even a [WHMCS module for managing Digital Ocean droplets](https://marketplace.whmcs.com/product/1402), if you really need to keep some sites on VPS's.

Running the sites on individual droplets does have several advantages like security and being able to adjust their resources on the fly but, if you move everything to a single server, you'll cut WAY down on the amount of administration you do (once things are properly configured). Plus, with CloudLinux, you can use Jailshell to isolate all of the accounts and you can set per-account resource limits so, as long as you have a powerful enough server, you can always give sites a boost. Also, cPanel is probably the most common & well-known hosting control panel and paying for one dedicated server license is cheaper than paying for 15+ VPS licenses.",1521597087.0

nid0,"Broadly speaking, you're correct. The whole point of RAID is to provide some degree of redundancy to protect against disk failures. If a single drive failing causes an outage, the RAID array has failed at its job.

There are obviously a variety of caveats:

What RAID level are you using? RAID0 (arguably not actually even really RAID) provides no redundancy. Lose a disk and everything's toast.

Are you sure you're only losing one disk at a time? Some RAID configs can tolerate multiple failures but often if 2 disks die everything's toast.

Are the disks actually dying? If you're using disks that aren't meant for RAID (and lack TLER for example) you could be seeing the disks briefly erroring (and again with multiple disks at once) taking the array offline.

The RAID controller itself could be faulty.

Lastly if the array is in a degraded state, depending upon the vendor it may switch from writeback to writethrough cache.

omgwtfbbq69,"""Cloud"" doesn't mean faster. It also depends what ""cloud"" is to the provider in question, as it has 100 different meanings depending on who's selling it. I'd recommend finding a better host and also one that can take a look over your site to help you make recommendations. In terms of speed, you'd likely get better performance with local SSD storage, proper caching, properly tuned servers etc than ""cloud"".",1520950082.0
craigleary,"Is this actually a vps (you have root access) or is it shared hosting. It really depends - yes the host could be bad, not necessarily. 

Some common issues I have seen moving to a vps (which may be ""cloud"") :

max connections being reached in the webserver

php is a CGI, and had lots of room for optimization

Memory limit in PHP is too low


If its a vps you may have root access to check these. 

If its shared hosting, you really can only complain to the host. 'Error 504 Gateway Timeout' being an issue before may just mean the system was proxying to a remote webserver, like nginx -> apache was used, or php-fpm/fastcgi was in use and it wasn't running. Not seeing this any more I may mean you no longer have such a set up (which may explain a reduction in speed if your site was using caching in nginx or a faster php set up over php-cgi).

loldol,"Going by your post history, I assume you ""upgraded"" from BlueHost Shared to BlueHost Cloud.

Your first problem right here is BlueHost. Look into getting a better host - people here seem to recommend SiteGround a lot, feel free to look around for a non-EIG host. Shared hosting should be fine for you.

Your second problem, (and the one that brought you here) I believe, is your theme. That doesn't mean there's something patently wrong with the theme, but some themes often do end up causing problems due to conflicts etc, or maybe just unexpected php memory sizes. Pick another theme and check your metrics, even if it's a random free WP theme. 

There's a whole different checklist for the theme scenario, so I suggest you start with the simpler option of removing/disabling your theme and checking if it is the problem.",1520973724.0

Mr_Marquette,I had two .tk domains with them and they took both away in the beginning of October of last year. No reason given and neither violated their TOS. One was my personal wedding website where guests were going to RSVP. I happened to catch it after the invites went out but before anyone received them. I’ll never recommend freenom again. ,1520395273.0
Hexad_,"Unfortunately, it's a known shady business model, the reason nothing is done about it is because it is provided for free and most people stopped using them. Co.cc was one of the only legit popular free domain providers but went out of business. That said I'm pretty sure before that, .tk and .co.cc (generally free domains) took a massive hit because Google deranked those domains (maybe to the point of not indexing) because they were free — hence popular for scam and virus websites.

Generally speaking, Freenom waits for your website to gain a little traffic/after some time - they park the domain on a page infested with ads for them. I'm not sure how it's done using their terms of service or today's exact wording of it, all I know is I've read too many horror stories regarding it.

FHR123,"• W3 Total Cache is the best from my experience for the number of features it has, but it's complicated. WP Super Cache is simpler and just works; if you are not experienced, I would use that.

• fastcgi\_cache and Varnish are not easy to set up correctly and I wouldn't use them unless your site is big.

• You could do Redis or Memcached based caching, but that's additional software that has to be installed, configured, secured and running. Not worth it for a smaller site.

• You can use fail2ban if you want to, it will throttle automatic scanners, which has the benefit of lowering the size of log files. Setting up SSH keys and disabling password authentication is more important though.

• Monit should work fine. I would also use an external service such as UptimeRobot or Pingdom. UptimeRobot is free.

• I recommend WP Super Cache \+ Autoptimize as a minimum. Autoptimize minifies and concatenates stylesheets, javascript and HTML, which means fewer HTTP requests are required for page load.

tsammons,"> Dedicated servers don't seem to be the way to go. They don't handle spikes in traffic very well, and I would much rather go to some kind of a cloud solution that can expand resources as necessary.

VPS affords the same limitation. VPS is just a dedicated server chopped up into smaller virtualized servers. You can only grow to the capacity of the dedicated server, plus to make matters more difficult, CPU and memory is shared among multiple nodes. You're not getting full access to those resources without some concessions.

Depending on the age of your dedicated, it would make more sense to go with a newer dedicated server. Put your sessions on tmpfs. Use OPCache. Upgrade to PHP 7. Get a server with gobs of RAM; I'd argue a SAS on hardware RAID is better than a sloppy-seconds nearline SSD for burst traffic. Optimize [MySQL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl/master/mysqltuner.pl) configuration. Put your site through a profiler. Install mod_pagespeed. Switch from PHP-FPM to ISAPI if you haven't yet. Enable slow query logging, etc.

If you are using a site builder tool in your theme and heavy plugins on your sites a 1GB VPS is too small.   Upgrade to at least a 2G VPS before you start to worry about other resources on the server.

Here are some command line tools you can use on your server to check resources:

top / htop: memory and CPU info plus a list of running processes. These tools use resources too so don't leave them running on the server.

iotop : check IO usage on your disks

free :  show memory usage. This one is tricky because cache and buffer data is ""available"" memory but shows as ""in-use""

ntop : Network monitoring

There are other tools you can use to push data from the server to a database and then build graphs based on that. With your server having so few resources I don't recommend these get used.


ProTip:  Adjust your nginx / Apache settings so you can't have too many concurrent connections base your maximum on PHP memory limit settings. This is a tricky area depending on how you have your LAMP stack setup. Some research required.

KH-DanielP,"Sadly any review site can be gamed. It's going to be 100% impossible for them to be 100% accurate. I think one good thing about his site is that he does take pride in it and works very hard to keep things accurate. I've seen duplicate tweets get picked up before so that's not entirely uncommon. End of the day reviews are useful but ultimately worthless. I know for a fact that several competitors in our industry requires their employees during down time to signup for fake accounts and post positive reviews. I won't call them out as it won't do any good but its really obvious and in my opinion very shitty.

The day and age that companies really live and die on reviews is slowly going away, as I think more and more people realize that they really can't trust that random XYZ's persons review. That's why making a real connection with your customers and getting those personal recommendations are what counts more than how many good tweets / reviews you get.


",1519826303.0
ReviewSignal,"No system is perfect. Minor scale manipulation isn't really impressive though if we're being honest. It's scaling it to a point where it makes a meaningful difference and not being caught that would be. So a few tweets cheating here and there, not really a big problem. It's going to happen, when I look through my data I find company representatives that haven't been flagged as such in the system. I find mistakes in sentiment analysis all over the place (at its best it was ~90% accurate, probably a bit lower now), it's got plenty of flaws that are visible if you look. The advantage here is the volume of data overwhelms all the minor issues. You got 3-4 accounts into the system (my system shows multiple but doesn't actually count them more than once).

I've flagged them and searched to see if anyone else used those accounts (nope). 

Major movements in the rankings are actually quite rare. I write about them and analyze them quite a bit. They are few and far between (mostly EIG brands as they get acquired). Large scale manipulation is a lot harder, while small scale cheating or my system being imperfect is definitely a thing. I've noticed my system failing on a couple types of posts which it shouldn't be flagging a certain way and have been meaning to find the time to upgrade it to catch stuff more accurately. The 'great post' type stuff is on the list. As far as duplicate messages, it hunts for the same message posted by multiple accounts, it doesn't do it right away through on a first duplicate.

I do take exception with your conclusion though that it's not a valid source at all. You got 3 fake reviews into over 335,000+. It's a drop in the bucket, for a statistical system like mine it's not meaningful in the slightest. My data has been shown to track with internal data from companies (https://reviewsignal.com/blog/2015/08/19/liquidweb-nps-scores-vs-liquidweb-review-signal-rating/). That's with all it's imperfections, mistakes and minor scale cheating companies may be applying. Individual reviews may be not that helpful, but the overall tracking of them - is very much meaningful. The massive amounts of data tell a better and more accurate story than any other third party method I've seen (another example: https://reviewsignal.com/blog/2016/11/08/the-sinking-of-site5-tracking-eig-brands-post-acquisition/).

Good, good. Did you submit an automated form for this, or contact their support team?

> Everything fine until I received an email saying that I have been charged for my domain. I spoke with support and they said that host and domain are two different things so now I needed to cancel my domain. I agreed and deleted it thinking that it was my fault for not reading the terms. After doing it I was assured for this person that I wouldn't be charged anymore.

They're correct, and it's actually because of how domain registration works. Hosting is provided directly by HostGator, and your payments for hosting go toward paying for the server hardware, software licensing, and for the support and other employees that provide the service. Domain registration has a much lower profit margin, and because of the rules surrounding domains which all registrars must agree to, there are strict limits on what options HostGator has for handling refunds and renewals. If you used an automated form, I can excuse them for not intervening -- if you raised a support ticket in order to cancel your hosting package, I would have hoped that they would ask if you wanted to cancel renewals for the domain also.

> Today, more than one month later, I have received another email from Hostgator saying that they have charged me with 15$. Upon speaking with support they say that even if I cancelled my account and domain I didn't remove my credit card from their system, which means that they will keep charging on cancelled accounts. Crazy stuff.

This is the first unjustified statement you've made -- what do they say the $15 is for? Was it in any way warranted, or at least explained?

If it was for a service that you failed to cancel, then you're in the ethical dilemma of accepting the fee and going through the proper processes to cancel any services you didn't properly cancel, or issuing a chargeback out of frustration and despite it being technically your fault. If it was for a service you did cancel and they're refusing to refund, then by all means file a complaint with your credit card provider and let them hash it out with HG.

> They are not refunding me those 15$, so I just wanted to share this shady way from Hostgator to trick customers on keep being charged. In my opinion, if someone cancel his account has the obvious intention of stop being charged without the needed of removing different information on different sections of the website.

This makes me wonder all the more what it is for. Was it the fee for the domain renewal, or for an additional domain? Those are generally unrefundable, and $15 would be in the range for a domain renewal.

Without info on what the $15 was for, it's difficult to offer sound ethical advice. Removing the card from their system is the obvious easy solution; issuing chargebacks is the alternative if the fees were for services you had explicitly canceled (as compared with services you assumed would be canceled by association).",1519487328.0

slang_wound,"I've always felt like if you're going to have a box for webhosting, and you're hosting something super important that can't afford downtime, let the box be dedicated to that. Obviously that's personal preference, and depends greatly on how important your sites are. Using VM's also has a number of advantages although so YMMV.

[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) is probably the simplest option for you. It's free and open source so you don't have to worry about licensing. You get native linux (debian) on the baremetal, so you still have access to ssh and rsync, making backups a breeze. 

Proxmox supports a number of different storage backends (you should probably use qcows), KVM VM's and LXC containers.

There's a little bit of a learning curve to get it going, but nothing super unreasonable. You likely need to setup the storage and network via the OS installer or command line. Not too big of a deal. Once that is setup they have a ton of [documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Documentation).

If you end up going with Proxmox, they have an installer ISO. Although I've always found it easier to do a vanilla debian install and install proxmox on top. You can find a guide on how to do that [here](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Install_Proxmox_VE_on_Debian_Stretch)

[ESXI](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html) is another good option, although you get way less access to the baremetal and would need to get Veeam or something similar to do VM backups. It doesn't support containers so you'd only be able to do VM's here.",1519397494.0

mamborambo,"Since your sites are static pages (html, css, js files), the easiest solution is to host them on Github for free:

1. You just create a repo for each site,
2. enable the Github Page integration, 
3. upload the files
4. (optional step) point your custom DNS to the github-page

Netlify is similar, with a bit of management / analytics / database services patched on, but seems like you won't need them.

With DO, you need to system admin the bare VM yourself:

1. Install a VM image (ubuntu or debian)
2. set up user accounts
3. install packages via APT for a web server  e.g. nginx or apache
4. manage the configuration files to accept your DNS domains
5. perform backup or run cron jobs, as per housekeeping

I wouldn't recommend someone not really interested to become a Linux sysadmin, to become responsible for their own VM -- it is a very deep rabbit hole.

I say this because we're on that list, despite the fact that we don't (yet) accept payment via Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency).

In my experience if you're planning to run a crypto project that you expect to become popular you want to be hosted somewhere that has real DDOS protection.

Whether you go the route of a decent shared host or your own VM on Azure/AWS/DO/Linode/Vultr etc is going to largely depend on your experience and ability to manage a system.

There are tools services that can assist you in running a VM on these platforms, but if you're starting from essentially zero knowledge, a robust, scalable shared hosting platform is going to be an easier bet.

The ultimate rule here is to pay for the domain yourself. I've seen it happen before where a developer or partner registers a domain for someone less tech savvy only to steal the domain when the person that hired them tries to part ways.

Sometimes it might be justified - I had a client in 2004 ask me to build a website. I brokered a hosting plan for him and registered his domain, all out of my pocket and without asking for any money upfront. He never paid the invoice, so I have never released the domain. I was out over $100 because I paid for a years worth of hosting (this was shortly before I started my own hosting business). I wasn't about to release control and just changed the registrant in to my business name.

Other times, though, it is outright theft in terms of morality, but legally not so. A friend of mine had a popular website and her web developer who set up her domain and managed the hosting decided to steal the website when she wanted him to turn it over to her, even though she was paying him for it all those years. In the end, she just had to rebrand and open a new website with a new domain name.",1519151294.0
SamuelLDotson,""" I thought the ICANN information was a be-all-end-all in terms of domain ownership. ""

not necessarily, especially since it seems that name on the ACCOUNT itself is probably the name of the developer.  

However, she is the owner of the domain, and name.com kind of has an obligation to help her get the domain.  She may have to prove her identity by sending in HER ID.  

If they don't allow her to do that, she should contact ICANN and submit a complaint.  ICANN can try to force name.com's hand.

If you are on a shared hosting plan on a cPanel server, your web host *might* be able to give you the AutoSSLs, though they may decide to charge for it if they offer them.

If not, I highly suggest ssls.com, a NameCheap website, as they charge some of the lowest prices I've seen. I believe it is about $90 (actually on sale for $71!) a year, which is reasonable if you have more than 10 subdomains that require SSLs.

Remember this about SSL certificates, they are all smoke and mirrors. A free SSL has the same exact level of protection as a $1000 SSL certificate. The difference is in the ""warranty"" and the trust in the issuer.

The warranty covers not the SSL owner, but those that make purchases through a website protected by an SSL certificate they issued. It doesn't cover anything but if there is a flaw with the SSL certificate that allows someone to cause a loss, which is practically impossible. It does not cover if a website gets hacked, and that is far easier to do that hack a SSL encrypted communication.

I know of no one in the history of SSL that has ever been paid out from these warranties. It will never happen. So by all means, pay the lowest you can for a certificate, but make sure it is issued by a reputable issuer to prevent ""untrusted issuer"" warnings in some browsers.",1519152328.0

ixnyne,"I don't know if they are wording this in a misleading way, but pretty much all registrars do.

The way things usually work is there's no actual transfer fee, just a renewal fee that's charged during a transfer. You can pay as many single renewal fees as you'd like at any time and it will just add more years to your expiration. So if your domain is currently with GoDaddy (just for example) and it expires 10/10/2018 and you pay GoDaddy to renew today your expiration date will be set to 10/10/2019 (and so on depending how many times you do it, regardless of the day or month of the actual expiration). If instead you pay Namesilo the renewal fee and complete the transfer process (which let's say is free when you pay the renewal fee) then your expiration date will still have a year added, but the domain will move to Namesilo in the process.

Some registrars (including Namesilo) charge a different rate for new registrations, renewals, and transfers (which again is just like a renewal). This is done to attract new customers with lower new and transfers rates, and the renewal rate is usually a little more. All of this is common practice, but some registrars like network solutions charge $24+ for one domain for one year, while others like Namesilo charge closer to $9.

Lastly most registrars charge extra for domain whois privacy. If you go to [who.is](http://who.is/) you can type in domain names and see information about who owns them, including their address and phone number, unless they have domain whois privacy. Namesilo offers privacy for free.",1518907449.0

,[removed],1518940736.0
craigleary,"From a host perspective I can give some advice (I can't say if godaddy is really the issue but these might help)

* look into wordpress fastest cache. In my opinion this is the best, next to litespeed cache (which requires litespeed and godaddy almost certainly does not have).

* You can use remote jquery to help increase the speeds (look for plugins to do this). That will help page loading time.

* Time to first byte - cloudflare can be helpful here. Not only for the caching but due to the geo distributed dns. DNS does affect TTFB as does the initial page loading.

Gtmetrix is a nice tool for testing page speeds but you need to take the results with a grain of salt. First, their servers are heavily used, the free version tend to have lots of traffic. If you are coming from Vancuver but godaddy in in NYC, you will get additional latency on the test. Pingdom may be closer. Also gtmetrix gets the result based on wherever the data comes from, and most sites have outside content that will affect the speed. Pingdom does not take into account for this.

If you move the site, and want cpanel, check into a litespeed host because you can use the excellent litespeed cache, it has built in static file caches and quic protocol which will help sites with minimal configs. If you don't need cpanel, look into a wordpress managed host - one that is specifically for wordpress. They should be, if they are worth their price, doing optimizations for wordpress sites to increase the speed.

Basically godaddy's cpanel package is a package that comes with email, ability to host domains, php, mysql - and is generaly to run any script. Your basic support rep is there to ensure these tools load not that the 1000+ plugins and themes for wordpress also work. A managed wordpress host will take deeper looks into plugins usually. It is also much easier to secure, and speed up a single platform (like wordpress) over a very general any php script can run.",1518960460.0

human_being_01,"Correct me if I am wrong but isn't the following a fail-proof way of determining whether the issue is with the server or with the app:

Create the simplest PHP script imaginable. I personally recommend a PHP info file:

    <?php
    
    phpinfo();
    
    ?> 

Have that file called something arbitrary like **info.php** and place it in your document root.

Now you can run a Pingdom test on that specific script: **http(s)://(www.)yourdomain.com/info.php**

That way you eliminate your own application/site as a factor. If you still get abominable wait times when testing that script then yeah, something is up with your server. If the server responds in a timely manner, however, you will know that something is stalling your core application (if I am not mistaken we are talking about WordPress so that won't be unheard of).

If the latter turns out to be true, then you should seek the help of a developer: someone who can check what exactly is happening when someone sends a request towards your index.php.

Also note that when Google PageSpeed Insights says ""Reduce server response time"" it almost never means ""buy more hosting"". You can check their take on server response time [here:](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/Server)

*There are dozens of potential factors which may slow down the response of your server: slow application logic, slow database queries, slow routing, frameworks, libraries, resource CPU starvation, or memory starvation.*

In my experience, slow application logic and slow database queries play a huge part in this (especially with eCommerce, plugin-packed WordPress sites). Even the Obama Foundation website (which is built on WordPress) can sometimes show with ""slow server response"" times when tested with Insights. It is a very demanding metric.

guruscotty,"Since you’ve indicated you’d like to go with WordPress, which is what I work in all day, I highly recommend the strategy of going with managed WordPress — let someone else worry about security, and let Google’s Gsuite handle email. My favorite is WP Engine, which would cost you (I think) $45 a month. But that gets you 2 websites with staging and live sites for both, SSL, and what I think is amazing support. Staging means you can have a copy of your website to play with, which you can then push to live. Oh, and they also have an easy backup system, should you break the site and need to roll it back a few hours.

The security aspect is one of the things that sold me — you absolutely do not to get hacked, and try and unhack it yourself at your skill level.  If your site does get hacked, it’s WP Engine’s problem to sort it out, not yours.

For E-commerce, I like WooCommerce. There’s a lot of support for it, and a ton of ways to extend it. Unless you’re trying to do something really complex with shipping rates or a lot of production options, you should find it pretty easy.

WP Engine doesn’t do email, so I point my customers at G Suite-based email. It’s Gmail but with your domain name. $5 an email, though you can have endless aliases, and it just works. Super easy to set up and administer, which is what you want.

nid0,"First thing, check the /home/*/cpanel3-skel/public_html folder where * is the username of your main cPanel reseller account.

If the folder exists and contains the same index.php and -.php then this is the source of your problem, and likely indicates that your reseller cPanel account has been compromised in some way in the past.
Delete the files from this folder to prevent them being placed into new accounts you create in future, then make sure your account itself is fully secured.

If this folder doesn't exist / doesn't contain these files, then the server your reseller account is hosted on has likely been compromised at the system level at some point in the past, and a piece of malware has managed to install these files into the system's main skeleton used to populate new accounts.
If this is the case the problem is in no way your doing, and you can't fix it. If your host won't take the problem seriously move hosts ASAP, because having a shared server rooted is bad enough, having a provider that doesn't care about the rooted box is 10x worse.",1518599603.0

Even if your provider says they maintain backups (GoDaddy say they do, however many VPS and particularly dedicated server providers don't unless you pay them to) it is vital you maintain your own backups of your essential content so that you can reconstitute your business if you need to.

Luckily it sounds like you have in some form at least, hopefully they're reasonably up-to-date. These are the backups you should always rely on, any backups your host says they take should always be viewed as a convenience, not disaster planning.

You probably also need to determine exactly what type of service you had and what you need going forward.

You may want to check the headers of the email - first make sure its not a local email (like from a form on your website, with out a captcha - that may not be checked by spamassasin).

Check if there is a greylisting option in cpanel, Enabling it can help reduce spam if its there but not enabled.

Overall, you are on cpanel which in all honestly does not have great spam filtering. You are limited to spamassassin and greylisting if enabled, and then email filters. Some hosts may have commercial spam filters available to improve spam detection but the vast amount of cpanel hosts only have the default. Also, a host as large as hostgator likely can not use common rbl's like spamhaus due because its not for commercial use - small hosts can bypass this due to a low amount of lookups but not a host the size of EIG.

Short answer is there's no fix to use HostGator's spam filtering without HostGator fixing how its email tokens are stored- in an aggregate, global database instead of localized to each account. They even linked to a [configuration generator](http://support.hostgator.com/articles/how-to-use-spamassassin-advanced) that I wrote some time ago.

The general rule for securing WP sites is to upgrade everything. All the time. If you're not running latest plugins/themes/core you're at risk.

It may be worth paying WordFence or sucuri to clean your sites and help you work out the infection method, or move to an alternative host who'll help you pin the issues down.

craigleary,"First, there is not a chance your host is inserting the code in your site - none whatsoever. I am going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you probably are upset the sites are getting compromised because that is frustrating.

50 sites, on cpanel I assume. Reseller hosting where they are isolated or addon domains? if its addon domains a single site could cause all to be hacked under most cpanel hosts (only a few also isolate addon domains). 

The most likely cause is there is something out of date. If it is wordpress perhaps your wordpress core updates, but not plugins and themes, or you have a paid theme with something like revslider not updating. You can look into http://wp-cli.org to updating plugins and themes automatically through cron yourself.

For security on hosts, most are not in the security business. Securi which is now owned by godaddy was very good and did no hosting, just security. There is no reason for a host to push this except it saves them support - they are not making much reselling it to do. 

You need to look into securing the sites, or finding a host that specializes more in security and has a good WAF firewall system, isolation of domains, potential automatic patching of scripts, vunlerabilities security issues, and malware scanning. Only a host that is more specialized in security, or a much smaller host, is going to take the time to look into your site and better pin point how it happened and cleaning your site up.",1518291472.0

The restriction you're seeing (assuming you're on a cPanel-based system which I believe will be the case with ASO) is the SMTP Restrictions configuration which prevents unprivileged users from connecting directly to external SMTP servers, and instead rewrites the connection to the local server.

ASO telling you that 3rd party email being beyond the scope of their support rather than explaining to you that the problem is actually entirely of their making by a security configuration option they have explicitly set on their servers is an example of the stellar support you expect from EIG brands.

I imagine there is almost zero chance of ASO adjusting their configuration to suit you. Your options are move to a VPS, move to another shared host that doesn't block outgoing SMTP, or send your mail via your host's local mailserver rather than Office365.

Edit: Just for clarification - Blocking direct outgoing SMTP isn't an uncommon practice as very few users need this capability and it's often just used to send junk and bypass outbound mail filtering but most decent hosts will accommodate users who have a legit need for the capability and bypass your account through the block. I doubt ASO will do this for you.",1518045283.0

Having said that, Namecheap are fine. Little bit of upsell but they're alright. They also allow you to delegate control of domains to other accounts which is great if you want a client to buy a domain but then let you also mess with it.

On the topic of Easily I used them for a long time way-back-when. They're shit.

nid0,"Well, my previous post got autodeleted for mentioning the names of a couple of hosts to avoid, here goes again:

Basically, you've walked right into the scenario that causes shared hosting to exist.

It's cheaper to roll your own, but with that comes having to learn and understand the operation of several different pieces of software and their interactions with each other. Great if you're interested and have the time to spend on it, terrible if you want something that just works and is simple.

You basically have several options:

Stick with the barebones server you have now and continue with the research you're doing, it sounds like you're making pretty good headway so far, especially if you have nginx setup and actually working. Going this route, no, you generally don't need an FTP server. For both security and simplicity you can use SFTP to transfer content which will just ride off the back of the system's SSH server, up to you whether you configure users that're restricted to SFTP only or retain full SSH access.

Alternatively, stick some management software on the VM to take care of service setup for you. CentOS Web Panel is a basic but alright (and free) example for CentOS, cPanel is the industry standard but is a big, fairly complicated piece of software in its own right (and does have a license cost).

Alternatively again, you can use a 3rd-party orchestration service like ServerPilot to control your VM (though ServerPilot specifically is Digital Ocean-only, there are similar alternatives that can handle Vultr instances - They will basically spin up the VM for you and load it with relevant software that you select to be loaded onto it.

Finally, you can always stick with a shared host, and just find a decent one. Your current host fell into the terrible pit that is being bought out by EIG a few years ago and just like every other EIG brand are now absolutely terrible. There are plenty of decent shared hosts out there who will make your life easy though, just avoid ones owned by EIG and GoDaddy.",1517505891.0

rekabis,"If you are a largely non-technical user, I would go the “safe route” and stick with something that is externally supported: CentOS 7 with WHM/cPanel.

However, it is likely that your $5 Vultr plan will not be sufficient to run this. I have it myself, and with a number of sites it gets hammered quite often by hackers. I would recommend *at least* the next plan up.

You will have to pay extra for WHM/cPanel to have it run on your system, but IMO it is well worth the extra money from an ease-of-use perspective. You want to get up and running fast, with a decent to good setup, and not waste days or weeks tweaking your system. You are in the business of building websites, not servers. Focus on your side job, and not on the stuff that will take you away from your side job.

As for giving address details for domain validation certificates - they are not verifying this. In fact they probably don't need it, except maybe for some auto fraud verification. 

Hostgator uses cpanel, which has autossl. So they are disabling this feature to force you to buy ssl which in my opinion really isn't that cool seeing it is becoming a de-facto standard to have ssl everywhere and many other hosts offering the exact same package hostgator offers are providing ssl.

Most hosting happens in large datacenters. Putting a server in your house can work, but it's a lot of extra work and expense.

exitof99,"First off, your site may be the cause of the speed issues. If your new website is Wordpress based, it is highly likely that you are suffering from having too many plugins running and possibly not utilizing a caching plugin to speed up delivery.

Although I'm not a fan of any EIG hosts (they own HostGator and over 60 other brands), they should be able to perform well enough to not be horribly slow.

That being said, I've looked at files on the servers from GoDaddy and other hosts and seen exactly how many websites they are hosting on one server. The result was in the thousands, say 3000+.

Now, not every site will be active, many lie dormant only being browsed by bots and hackers. But the fact remains, the more hosted websites, the more likely that the server will have spikes of high activity which causes the other sites to slow to a crawl.

You can find out this by logging in to cPanel and clicking ""Server Information"" (unless disabled), which will tell you the server load. The server load number is relative to the number of processors, but if it is a high number, then the server is definitely a cause of delayed response time. If this is indeed the cause, you could potentially ask that they move you to another server, or move to a different host.

The short of it is you might be best off having a professional examine your website to determine what is causing these issues. I can have a look for you if you'd like at no cost, just message me.",1516791394.0
ReviewSignal,"So you probably googled reviews, thought Host Gator was good and were suckered like thousands before you. Almost all the reviews are fake for web hosting because they pay crazy amounts of money and people are happy to sell you out for a buck in general.

Here's the sad truth, there's no perfect web hosting company. Even the best rated companies have people who have bad experiences. These are service businesses and rely on hardware. People and hardware screw up, sometimes. Although some companies screw up (a lot) less and are better about fixing things when they do go wrong. I track that data based on what people are saying on twitter if you're [curious](https://reviewsignal.com/webhosting/compare). But again, keep that skeptical mind towards any reviews about hosting companies.

Now for some more practical help, why did you move off Wix? What was missing or what did you hope to accomplish? Site builders like Wix/SquareSpace/WordPress.com are all pretty powerful and often are enough for basic sites. So understanding where you're trying to go with your new website is a good starting point. Shared hosting is often more than fast enough assuming it's not on a slow oversold server.

I have an ecommerce site and use Dreamhost VPS and pay $15/month. Just FYI you might need a web dev’s help if you’re not technically inclined but Dreamhost has decent support and sometimes they will take care of things for you out of courtesy. 

Most web hosting review sites are affiliate based and they are not subjective or very helpful. I’ve used pcmag and CNET for their take but honestly it boils down to trial and error.

2) Check /var/log/messages for the error. I'm assuming the engineer was able to find out it was ip-utils somehow so I'd assume it's booted into the system and just isn't getting networking, in which case it should show in the logs and should be fairly straight forward to fix.",1516568486.0

lukevp,"I'll throw my hat in the ring as well.  You really need to have a better backup policy, and nothing mission critical should ever be hosted on one single server / VM, or even with one host if you can help it, and not at a single datacenter either.  Then you should have some type of external routing where this server can drop out of a cluster with no ill effects.  Then have a rolling deployment process that hits one server in the cluster at a time (even if it's just 2 servers).  That way, next time something like this happens you can scrap the server/container/VM/whatever, set up a new one (from backup or snapshot), verify functionality, re-include it in the cluster, and then proceed.  Cloud providers make it a lot easier to provision like this (eg ELB in AWS) but you can also do this to your own VMs using something like Cloudflare Load Balancing.  If you wanted to do it for free you could use multiple A records but that's kind of sketchy and doesn't work on all devices or in all situations.

Overall you should count your blessings that they are able to recover this for you.  You're saving money because it's unmanaged and then you're asking them to do active management tasks for you?  $150  is cheaper than Best Buy charges for backups to be restored.

trumpetMercenary,"Here’s how the story ended:
I called them again today to ask about the questions I got on this thread (is there a remote/safe mode console available).  This time I got a much nicer and more sympathetic support person; this time I didn’t say anything about what I did:  I simply told him the site was down, he said to please wait, then got with some leads.  After about a 20-30 minute hold, he apologized for the wait and said that the server was back up.  He said something about the server’s parent server having a network problem and how they needed to re-patch the network and everything was good to go.

The site is back up now, everything works, and I have a complete offsite backup.

Obviously, guy #2’s response was a lot different from guy #1’s.  Guy #1 spent most of the call blaming me for updating yum and asking for $149 to roll back the server updates.  Guy #2 said nothing about the server itself and blamed it on their network.  Which one was right?  Maybe both of them.  But it is certainly strange that both calls had completely different results.

Now, here are the takeaways:

1. You get nicer support on weekdays than weekends.  Maybe try calling twice if you run into a completely unreasonable heap of bullshit like I did.

2. GoDaddy is already an expensive VPS host (somewhere like $20 a month for a flat rate) but they’ll gouge you even more to roll things back.

3. Applying regular CentOs patches has no problems in AWS, DigitalOcean & vmWare, but apparently proceed with caution if you’re using GoDaddy

4. Obviously, always have not only backups (duh) but OFFSHORE backups

5. “Rules are rules” doesn’t always apply. The naysayers on this thread would have had me suck it up and pay the hefty price to roll back a simple update, when a call back revealed that the problem was on their end and that I didn’t need to pay this ridiculous fee after all.

Finally, a sincere thank you to those who were sympathetic to my problem; I’m not a perfect sysadmin/web developer and everyone makes mistakes, but we learn from them.",1516930789.0

Otherwise the data goes to whomever your father specified in his will, and if that doesn’t directly say, then to his heirs in general (which would include you). Unless the business agreement between your father and them specified that all business assets were to be handed over in the event of his death, *do not hand them over*. If there is no business contingency for his death, your father's property is now the property of his inheritors, not the business associates.

With that said, I have a Vultur instance myself. If your father was as paranoid as I am, there will be a Password *and* a 2FA passcode that you will be challenged for. The 2FA code will probably linked to one of his personal devices (look on his phone for a 2FA code generator - there are a number of them for each platform - which might also be password/passcode protected).

Even if you gain access to the Vultr interface that can manage the virtual machines, you then have to gain access to the servers installed on these virtual machines. These servers will also have usernames and passwords, and again - if your father was as paranoid as I am, these will be strong passwords and stored in a secure place. Look for a password database on his computer such as KeePass that stores passwords. Some people will use a password database hooked into their browser, such as LastPass.

Be aware that Vultur charges by the runtime-hour, and that it bills in estimated blocks of hours, which means that billing will not adhere to a calendar weeks, months or years. It will be on a very odd-looking schedule. And since your father is now deceased, you will probably have to update the billing to ensure a different person’s credit card is on file for future billings. Billing is by auto-withdrawal, so except for the first automated withdrawal or two (which will appear odd to the CC companies, such that you *may* have to phone in and authorize the source of the withdrawals) you should *not* have to manually conduct the payments yourself.

Most Vultr VMs (at least 95%) will be some variant of Linux, but you can also run Windows on them if you roll your own custom image. Be sure you get a professional to look through them once you gain access to them. Go for a business-class support provider, especially one that specializes in supporting other businesses that have servers. Now is not the time to cheap out. If you have the money, and have gained direct access to the servers, contract for at least three to six months with a support provider so that they can conduct routine maintenance, handle support requests and ensure that these servers stay up and uncompromised by hackers and the like. This will allow you to step back and get yourself out of emergency mode, and provide some breathing room to take stock of the situation.

Second, failing the root passwords from /u/planfourscott's recommendation -- it's plausible that these were changed at some point -- contact Vultr support.

Alternately, they should be able to point you toward who can make those requests, if it isn't you for some reason.

Be careful, and be prepared for this to take a couple of days while Vultr runs through any processes they have for customers who have died. They may also need to contact whoever is handling the legal side of his estate to verify that you are permitted to do this.

I started with Wix and Ecwid, but needed to be able to watermark my sheet music with the customer's order information so that my music would not be disqualified from national and regional competitions and festivals. Ecwid told me that I'd have to put a downpayment of $2000 towards implementing this feature in their store. (Plus I would have to pay extra monthly to use it afterwards.)

After researching other platforms, I chose Wordpress because of its relative ease of use compared to solutions like Drupal and Joomla.

My first Wordpress hoster was SiteGround. They had the absolute best customer service ever. Fast, knowledgeable, responsive. But I discovered too late that the watermarking plugin my website required needed a program called FPDF to be installed on the server, which SiteGround not only refused to support on their shared business plan, but they told me that *no one* would offer support for FPDF unless I upgraded to a dedicated server. I did not have the $69/month to spend on a dedicated server, so I looked elsewhere.

My next host was HostGator. I had a pretty good response with them. Their cloud solution supported FPDF and was cheaper than SiteGround's business shared hosting solution. I used them for exactly one year without problems.

Then, one year to the second that I signed up for Hostgator, my website was compromised. I panicked as I saw all of my backups except one fail. Hostgator extorted $200 from me for a security scan, then when the malware returned, demanded another $1400 if I wanted to continue hosting files with them.

I then switched to 1&1, whose definition of ""fully managed server"" involves throwing you into a CLI shell and giving you a google link to installing Wordpress yourself. I managed to brick the server while trying to configure the settings from the links they provided. They proceeded to take 2 months of monthly hosting fees after I canceled, requiring me to dispute the charges before getting a partial refund.

I then moved to DreamHost. They seemed great until I contacted tech support. Sometimes I would wait as long as 3-4 hours to chat with someone, only to be directed to a website that I couldn't understand. Email tickets would take as long as 3 days for a response. The glacial response of their tech support made it impossible for me to troubleshoot my website, and then they said that the hosting solution I selected did not qualify under their money back guarantee.

I checked with A2 -- no FPDF support, HostPapa -- no FPDF support, WPEngine -- no FPDF support, etc.

Finally I tried a VPS solution with the company I have my domain name hosted with, Namecheap. After being forced to upgrade the service once, I started with them. The site was always very slow with them --- TTFB times were as long as 12-20 seconds or even longer in a few cases. They told me they couldn't help me unless I upgraded for an extra $75/month to a fully managed solution. When I did, then they told me it was my theme, and they could do nothing to help.=. (It was never this slow with Hostgator). Finally, trying to upload a new product crashed the site altogether, and Namecheap said I should upgrade to a solution that was $40/month more than what I was spending before.  After having to upgrade from $9/month to $19/month to $39/month to $114/month, I couldn't afford another upgrade.

Now I am with TMDHosting--fully managed, equivalent specs for 1/2 the price of Namecheap, and now the watermarking plugin is not working for new products uploaded (but works fine for older products entered before the migration). TMD said they could do nothing. WooCommerce (the makers of the plugin) are taking longer than I would like to troubleshoot this issue.

I may jump ship altogether to Joomla and Magento, as that is what my primary competitor uses, and it appears she has few if any problems.

I have gone from earning $800+ month on my website to not even $100 since the hacking. It is discouraging.",1516568328.0

2. I’d say you hit your limit. Probably between 100-200 concurrent users.

3. It’s either BS or that particular representative didn’t know what they’re talking about.

4. You could find a better host, that specifically states the resources that you’ll get. Otherwise you can get a VPS. If you think you’ll get lots of traffic down the road then this is probably the best option for you. You should take whatever steps are necessary to learn about that, and test it.

StrongestCoffee,"I personally recommend namecheap, porkbun, (the only ones I have used) other good registers are google domains, ghandi, namesilo, 

Adding onto why you should separate hosting and domain registration, I would say is that if problem happens with billing and payments for hosting like if you want to cancel they can't hold your domain hostage and  a lot of hosting providers like the domain with the hosting package so if you try a chargeback they take the domain. 

a recommendation is that having the following operation which I use and have people use:

* a domain registrar (make sure the company specializes in domain not a hosting company that provides domains).  
* a hosting provider (pick somthing that fits your needs then look at the extra features that they offer, such as free SSL, you can get that somewhere else focus on your needs.
* a dns manager it helps so that you don't have to login to your domain registerar every time you want to change something. and if you have more then one domain at different places the dns is all in the same place. or if giving other people access without risking them changing your domain settings (I personally use cloudflare, dnsimple is also good. and also AWS route53)",1516292863.0

Video hosting is a tough one to get right. Video takes up HUGE storage space at the modern levels of quality, resolution and framerate people expect. You are better off hosting your videos on something like Youtube or Vimeo and simply embedding them into your site. This will also give you Youtube/Vimeo presence which can facilitate in driving traffic and revenue to your company. If your website is a huge success, and for some reason you aren't happy with youtube/vimeo hosting, you can look into CDN (content delivery networks) or something like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and set up your on-demand distributed cloud. It's complicated, and can get rapidly expensive, but for self hosting video and making it accessible at low latency to the world, this is really your only option.

Do the techs speak your native language well? Do you have to wait in line? Etc etc. Take their support for a test drive, and ask THEM your pertinent questions. If they go above and beyond to help you, and make you feel knowledgeable, give them your business. If they treat you like trash, move on to the next one.

They don't. You don't do redirection like this in DNS. The answer to this question is ultimately going to be answered by asking ""What do 100.50.50.50, 65.65.10.10, and 210.210.210.1 do?"" and secondly, ""what is the setup for `assoc.com`?"" Chances are that those IPs are Reverse Proxies or redirect hosts that respond to the requests for `clientwebsite.com` and redirect them to `assoc.com/subdomain`. It's entirely plausible it's the same system, also plausible that it's not.

If your only concern is those DNS records, then recreate them with your new DNS provider. The ""hardest"" record to create is the wildcard, and I'm still yet to see a DNS provider worth their salt who can't do them.",1515525814.0

WoodsIT,"One of the advantages of using WordPress is that it is easy to migrate from one server to another. The easiest way to do this would be using a plugin such as UpDraftPlus but there are others - any WordPress backup plugin makes it easy to copy it from one location to another.

With that in mind starting with the host or hardware that suits you now is an easy option.

If your website really takes off you will most likely be looking high grade hosting such as ""managed"" services and ones that are super fast - you may not have the experience and knowledge required now and in the beginning, you may find that type of hosting would not be cost-effective.

If you are serious about building up your knowledge and being your own server administrator and are considering a VPS I would go straight to Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud. Both services are on some of the best infrastructure you will be able to find and have free options which can be used commercially. These services scale but you may find your knowledge and experience is what will limit you in the long run.

Make sure you are tracking pageviews etc. Just host it somewhere inexpensive IMO. if you have traffic problems its not hard to move a site but unless you are famous the 10 pageviews you get in a month from family members giving you a pity click from Facebook wont be an issue.

> how easy it is to scale up if my blog grows?

Scale is the wrong direction.

Caching is generally better than scaling. In short scaling is working harder, caching is working smarter.

For a typical blog handling an insane amount of traffic is more about *not* needing more RAM/CPU!

You want to touch the database and php as little as possible. You can do this at the application layer in WP via plugin's and at the server level. Server level caching is generally better, but application based caching has a few edge case advantages.

Lots of layer to this onion, but this is enough to start with.

PPLB,"Hey! :)

**First and foremost**
I don't think namecheap supports .jp extensions. I don't work for namecheap, so you could try contacting namecheap with this question.

A reason why namecheap is not supporting .jp extensions might be because you need to ""reside in Japan"" to actually be able to register a .jp domain name. Note: Providers/hosters that do support the extension most likely have a way around this. A contact in Japan, an address they can use to register the domain name to.

**The transfer**
The transfer itself is quite straightforward: You contact the current provider, or the new provider and tell them you want to transfer/switch ownership of the domain name. In most cases you can also initiate the transfer by just simply adding the domain name to the shopping cart, and finishing the purchase.

Some verification will have to be done after initiating the transfer. We don't want unauthorized transfers. In case of JP extensions, vertifications will happen via mail and a link with which the current owner can verify the transfer. The new owner may also receive a message. Another note: Transfer condition vary per domain extension, but are usually quite straightforward.


**Current hosting agreement ends**
What happens with this? Well as long as you initiate the transfer on time, nothing will happen. The agreement ends, but the current provider can't cancel the domain name, because it's not theirs anymore.


**Content**
The content is not part of the domain name itself. The registration of the domain name only registers you as the owner of the domain name. What you do with that name is entirely up to you. Most providers can help you figure out if you need web space, a hosting package and other stuff. If you want to keep the website, you will have to ask the current owner for those files.

**Additional**
Some transfers may take up to two business weeks to finish. Usually they are fully automatic, but a build in safety for the owner to respond in case of fraud. Some transfers require additional payments. Some domain names require an authentication code in order to transfer the domain name. This is not the case with .jp domain names, but just in case you had other plans :)

**Hosting services/providers**
I feel like I can't answer this question. Sorry :)


**Tip**
Call the hosting provider you are going to register the domain name with. I think it is important to know how they treat you, as well as how they're willing to help   +  they can help with any other specifics you may need :)",1514980579.0

Hosting and domains are separate. It would be much easier to do a change of ownership at the same domain registrar the domain is currently with. This is called a domain push or domain move. Do a whois lookup on the domain name to find out which company is the current registrar and then go look at their site to see if they support domain push or domain moves.

The cost of a domain is so cheap these days it shouldn't hurt your yearly budget as a company to have a handful of TLDs for your domain.

If you're talking about a personal site or hobby and not a business then it's really up to you. Personally I have a rather unique last name, and I have owned [mylastname].com for many years, and nobody had snatched up the other tld options until today I grabbed the .net and .org just to have them. I'm not a brand, and don't have a big family, so I'm not at all concerned with anyone trying to impose on my last name by purchasing a TLD, but like I said domains are so cheap these days it's not going to break the bank for me to just grab them.

The only warning I would really give on this is to use a registrar that's up front about their renewal pricing. Some registrars will hook you with a cheap 1st year cost and then when it comes time to renew you can be looking at double or even higher prices to keep the domain. I'm a fan of Namesilo, they show the renewal price crossed out below the new registration price whenever you lookup a domain. They also offer free whois privacy, which most other registrars charge money for.

Leftaas,"The internet is a series of computers communicating with each other. But for a certain computer to communicate with another computer there needs to be some sort of identification in order to know with whom you are communicating. So each computer is assigned an IP address or an ID of some sort.

A domain name is basically an IP address translated   to a form that is readable by humans. When you are paying for a domain name you are basically paying for the right to call yourself a certain name on the internet.

Just having a name or an IP address means nothing if that address doesn't correspond to a certain system or computer on the internet. By paying for hosting you are renting out that computer, so any time someone calls your domain name, their are able to access the information on the computer (ie hosting server) that is tied to that domain name.

You could potentially host a website from your own computer, in fact I have done this, but when you using that method you have to take into account several limiting factors: When you shut off your computer, the website goes down with it (it's hard to maintain a 24/7 access). Slow commercial internet speeds. And a lot more issues that make self-hosting a reliable website not worth it, in most cases (at least not in my opinion).

GoDaddy, 1&1 etc are ""domain registrars"" they interface with individuals and organisations who wish to purchase a domain. Registrars usually aim to make a profit on selling domains, however they choose to market and price that.

Using ReliableSite as an example (they seem to have the largest selection of servers):  

Dual Intel Platinum 8160:  $1100/month (RS) or $9600 (2x CPUs bought).  Pay off at 9 months.  
Dual Xeon Silver 4114: $259/month (RS) or $1420 (2x CPUs bought).  Payoff at 6 months.  
Dual E5 2620: $169/month (RS) or $180 (2x CPUs bought).  Pay off 2nd month.

---

If you plan to use the CPUs long term it will be much cheaper to build your own than to rent a server.  Of course my costs above are for CPU only and do not include the case, mobo, memory or other such things.  Those will add costs but it will still end up cheaper eventually.  

If it's a temporary thing then you'll want to rent.  For that you'll probably be decently served by ReliableSite (due to selection.)

OriginalSimba,"Wix is a very shady operation. They market their service as ""free"" to attract customers and then they hit you with a lot of fees.

There's no such thing as a free lunch. Building services like WIX requires a lot of man hours and those men expect to get paid for their labor. If a service is advertising itself as free there is always a price somewhere, and if they aren't up front about their real fees then you should avoid them because deceptive marketing tactics are what hustlers use, not legitimate businesses. It has been said that capitalism is about separating fools from their money, and that is the real business model Wix and their ilk are involved in.

As for why Namecheap's service is so cheap, it's shared hosting, it's basically crap. They put 1,000 customers on a single server and they are betting that most of those customers' websites will receive no traffic. In other words they are banking on your projected failure. If too many of those customers have successful websites it will consume all of the server's resources and then all 1,000 of those customers are negatively affected. To prevent this many shared hosting providers will simply disable your website if you are getting too much traffic. Namecheap does this however they are not as bad as some, you do have to receive a lot of traffic to get on their ""bad customer"" list.

If your website is for business, you need to rent a VPS. They aren't expensive if you know where to look. If your website is a mission critical asset then you need to invest in it appropriately. If it's just a blog page and it doesn't matter to you if it goes offline or is slow to respond stick with Namecheap and install a free WordPress theme.",1513801419.0

sixgirls,"Not really, unless you're hosting some strange sites. If you consider how much data comes from a typical site / page, a CDN really shouldn't help all that much.

What's more often the case is that web servers are just configured in horrible ways and have completely inappropriate content. For instance, lots of people go plugin happy when setting up a Wordpress site. I can't tell you the number of sites I ""magically"" fixed by just removing the Statpress plugin - load times went from ten seconds to less than one second.

Also, if you don't optimize your media, for instance, you'll be cursing your site for taking fifteen seconds to load, not realizing those photos are each 20 MB and you're loading a dozen of them. Sure, you can get a CDN to make those dozen 20 MB files load faster, but that's not really fixing the problem - it's fixing the symptom.",1513723876.0
mvprj84,"I wouldn’t say that it saves us a ton in hosting costs, but a CDN also has some other benefits. My favorite thing is the ease of scalability it offers. We cache our entire site on our CDN, and as a result we never have to worry about monitoring traffic because the CDN both distributes the traffic globally as well as handles any kind of scaling that is needed. So if you have a site who’s traffic can be unpredictable it can also be nice from that point of view.

And yes, I know that we could handle all of that on our own. We previously managed a cluster of Varnish servers, but ended up switching to using Fastly because they offer a ton of awesome features. They do require a $50/month minimum so it’s not intended for low traffic sites though. It is by far the best CDN we’ve used because of the flexibility they offer.",1513732300.0

> I want a personal website showing my portfolio, and maybe a blog at some point. This I would like to build myself, preferably on node.js backend since that's what I use at work right now.  

few traditional hosting packages support nodejs, you will probably have to use a VPS and configure this yourself. The Plesk control panel has native support for Nodejs if you think you will need a control panel.
> Now the tricky part i guess: I want to set up an Owncloud (or Nextcloud) on the server that me and a couple of other people would use to produce music (big files).   

These are simply PHP applications which you could in theory use on a cheap shared hosting package, but you might hit limits on that so this kind of application is also better on a VPS
> Also I'd like the possibility to add other sites to the server at some point.  

Again a VPS is better you can put as much as you like on there, limited only by the resources of the server.

Overall a VPS is your best choice. If you don’t use a control panel you will literally get an SSH login and have to configure everything yourself. Some providers have prebuilt images for specific applications but if you want to host a few things on one VPS then you'd need to configure it yourself anyway. A control panel would give you a web based GUI to set up multiple sites and services, if you want nodesj choose Plesk (but then do use it, if you use a control panel to manage your server and also try to configure it manually you’re going to have a bad time). Finally think about service levels, many VPS's are unmanaged meaning host will only support you in making sure the VPS is running and accessible via SSH, with a managed or supported server then the host will actively help you with services and sites running inside the VPS as well.

clubnaporelse,"Amazon Web Services can offer all of these things in one place, and you can sign up for AWS free tier for a year. 

If you make certain mistakes, you can end up costing yourself more money, but I have been using AWS free tier for several months without any issue so far. Just watch your billing and be sure to terminate a service/server or contact support if you notice the numbers going up when you were only trying to utilize a free service. I’ve never racked up more than a $1-2 in a month.

AWS goes very in depth and it can be overwhelming, but is a fairly popular hosting ecosystem. Having knowledge about its different services can improve your ability to host more complex applications in the future. Because AWS is so popular, you can also find a large number of resources/documentation/stack overflow/reddit questions about it online.

Some AWS services you may want to look into include:

•Route 53 - domain registration and DNS service
•EC2 - basically a virtual server for your applications. Comes with a fair amount of storage.
•EB - Elastic Beanstalk - lets you run EC2 instances with pre setup environments (like PHP or Python for example) for which you can set scaling policies (when your site receives a lot of traffic, automatically spawn more EC2 instances to account for it)
•SES - simple email service. Lets you send up to 62,000 emails a month from an app running on an EC2 instance for free.
•RDS - Relational Database System - Lets you host databases separately with their own urls/endpoints. Databases could also be run directly on EC2 instances, but that is up to you to decide.

AWS is not the easiest thing to jump into, but you have also listed several requirements that necessitate a more complex hosting service. Other commenters may have suggestions that suit you better, but AWS is my go to hosting solution for web apps or really anything that isn’t a static site.

EDIT: If I read some of your requirements wrong, (especially the multiple databases part—we may not be thinking of databases in the same sense) then a simpler service may suit you better. If that’s the case, checkout digital ocean, linode, or heroku. Make sure you do NOT use godaddy or any of the other companies mentioned in the other comment. Also do NOT type your domain name on any domain registrar’s search function unless you plan to buy immediately. For trustworthy domain registration, I recommend namecheap.",1513542101.0

TeoChristian,"- Shared Server (for hosting) = a web server which is shared to multiple users... each client has an account on that server (like having an account on the same computer). All these users are using the same server, same processors, same memory, same operating system etc. This type of hosting is recommended for new users, and websites which are not high resource consuming (because when you use lot of resources you do affect the other users on the same server with you - ***like multiple people living in the same house***).
- Dedicated Server = a physical server which is yours. You can use it as you want... you can install any operating system, any software, you can use the resources at full etc exactly as your personal computer but with some advantages (like flood protection, stable network, high uptime, diesel generators etc) if the server is hosted in a data center (a magical place dedicated for running servers). ***It is like having your own personal house.***
- VPS Server = virtual private server. If you tried to install multiple operating systems on the same computer, you probably saw they are independent systems, each of them being managed by you when is selected from the bootloader. Something like that is happening here but these systems are running all in parallel, splitting the resources of the computer. A VPS server, depending on its type, could be like a dedicated server, because you are able to choose for an operating system, to install the software you want an to configure the system as you want. Basically the server is divided into multiple ""virtual"" servers. 
***It's like having an apartment in a block of flats.***

Shared hosting (little websites, low resources, cheap), VPS (big websites, high resources, price ok), Dedicated (flexible to your requirements, a lot of resources, really heavy websites, expensive)

You should start with a shared hosting and upgrade later to a larger plan, if your website will have a high number of visitors.

You should note that the most website owners  which are  upgrading to vps or dedicated are doing this not because the website got popular, but necause the website is poor coded, having:

- many database queries per page  (many cmss makes around 100 db queries only for default template )
- high page load times 
- high page generation times (hard coded, heavy functions)
- high memory consuming scripts
- too many requests per page 
- not using caching methods
- too many unuseful plugins
- high database size (unuseful tables,  rows  - not optimised)

A lot of resources (cpus, ram etc) are used with no purpose, a lot of electricity and money are being consumed because of poor coded softwares. So if your website will bneed a vps or dedicated please remember to check all of that and optimise the software before buying anything larger.

I'm not saying this is the case for you, but they did have the option of manually renewing domain names which if the pricing hasn't changed was $15.99.

tsammons,"How long have you used ipower? Since you've been a customer with ipower and have more than 1 transaction, and they've logged your IP address as well as personal information, the ability to dispute with Visa/MC is greatly diminished. Amex is a different beast. 

Disputes with Amex are often hard to overturn from the provider side. With Mastercard/Visa, if you can demonstrate on a card-not-present (ECI) transaction you need I believe 2, at most 3, compelling articles of information. One of which - and most damning - is a recurring, non-contested transaction. Second of which is a geoproximate login to the billing entity's zip. Third of which is of course dialogue with the card holder. Fourth is an email address that matches up with the bank. Fifth of which is personal information that matches up with the bank, including phone.

Negligence is not, however, a legitimate reason to contest a transaction (unless Amex). Moreover, companies will fight it, because when you file a chargeback a few things happen:

* The company loses the payment, 100% of it
* The company is charged a fee on top of it, between $15 and $75 (fuck you FirstData)
*  The company's risk tolerance is re-assessed. When operating on basis points - a risk management cost based upon hundredths of a point - they will go up once a contract expires. This affects their bottom line.

Any decent company will fight tooth and nail. Since iPower is owned by EIG and EIG is hemorrhaging as of late having recently ejected their founder amid poor sales, expect their lawyers to submit a boilerplate chargeback response.

You will lose.

**Addendum**: as a simple example response of a recently won chargeback for a client who forgot to cancel and instead filed a chargeback, which I would have happily refunded instead of writing up such documentation. The following points he lost his chargeback case; these points are easy to refute with any degree of logging:

> According to the Visa Core Rules and Visa Product and Service Rules (“Cardholder Agreement”), a
fraudulent transaction according to Chargeback Code 83 (Section 11.1.27, Cardholder Agreement) is one
in which the “Cardholder did not authorize or participate in a Transaction conducted in a Card-Absent
environment”. Furthermore, Use of Compelling Evidence (Section 11.1.8.3, Cardholder Agreement) is
satisfactory at time of Representment, which includes “details of identification presented by the
Cardholder”. This information would include Mr. XYZ's phone number and billing information, which
the bank mutually has on record. Moreover, in an ECI transaction, providing the “purchaser’s IP address
and the device geographical location at the date and time of the Transaction” in addition to the
“Purchaser’s name and email address linked to the customer profile held by the Merchant” as well as
“evidence that the profile set up by the purchaser on the Merchant’s website or application was accessed
by the purchaser and has been successfully verified by the Merchant before the Transaction Date” is
sufficiently compelling evidence",1513054211.0
bhnobody,"EIG likes to hide behind their ToS, but you can also use it against them. For example, while it is true that the iPower ToS does state that the 30 day money-back guarantee only applies to the first term of purchase, the actual ""30 day money back guarantee"" page *doesn't*, and that makes things ""confusing"" to the point that you can argue the case for a refund. It works especially well in places like California that have some laws favoring consumers in these circumstances.

I like them because a lot registrars have 10+ pages of upsells when trying to register a domain (looking at you GoDaddy!) but GKG offers one upsell when registering and that is it.

One benefit of using them is if you need DNS hosting (rare but sometimes needed) free DNS hosting is available for any domain you buy from them. Whereas, somewhere like namecheap.com charges for DNS. It is rare to need DNS hosting as all hosting providers have their own name servers; however, if you were setting up a Shopify e-commerce site and you had an existing domain you would need hosted DNS services.",1513275477.0

VPS is too difficult for a regular joe but I you have those demands then ok, but shared is for me (you can try more expensive package from shared with bigger resources) I pay 3,99/month and for my site is plenty. Ps Namecheap did have huge variations in speed cancel now. ",1512496353.0
OriginalSimba,"The business model of ""shared hosting"" is about overloading the server. If they don't overload it they won't make any money.

So yes. And you won't get any better treatment from any other shared hosting providers.

The only way to get reliable resources is to rent a VPS where the provider clearly tells you what portion of the server's available resources will be rationed off to you. Assuming the company you rent from is legitimate, you can rest assured those resources will not be available to any other customer as long as they belong to you.",1512506155.0

applesauce42,"I wouldn't do it. You off the bat would want to go with something like ServerPilot since you have no sysadmin skills. If you try to manage it on your own or with some basic software you're just running wayyy too much risk of downtime from both a security and software level. If you're doing 1k/day visitors that's too much traffic to risk fucking up. I would just stick to a managed host TBH. 

Also, are you on shared or cloud/vps Siteground? Shared is fine but I'm pretty disappointed in their cloud service. I've had my sites randomly 503 all the time for a few seconds which I think is related to their SG Optimizer plugin.",1512441387.0
tsammons,"> intrigued by VPS hosting because its faster.

Not always the case. Any hosting will be faster if it has the resources available to it to serve content. Congestion kills throughput and overprovisioning a server creates congestion. VPS makes congestion more difficult to deduce, because your neighbors are hidden from plain view. Moreover VPS is less efficient because you're duplicating necessary services (system logger, database server, web server, etc) across a few hundred nodes, where in an optimal environment 1 web server can serve for 300+ nodes. 

If Siteground performance is terrible, try an alternative shared hosting provider. VPS requires some system administration skill. If you don't know why Wordpress needs to be constantly updated, then don't go with VPS.",1512445176.0

Only compared to mismanaged  hosting, only in this context *you* get to be the person to mismanage it!

You are really talking about unmanaged vs managed.

>wondering how hard it would be for me set up hosting for my wordpress sites on Digital ocean?

Depends. do you mean to do it *properly* yourself? Difficulty is the wrong question. You should be asking how much time it would take a newbie to set up a full stack.
The bottom line is that it doesn't take much time to do it poorly. For sake of argument I'm define ""poorly"" as taking shortcuts that are sloppy but will bite you in the ass later.

There is a lot to learn. This is often less than obvious by simple looking tutorials that make things look easy by skipping a lot of important stuff.


Often you'll google something only to find *hundreds* of shitty blogs with old/out of date information leading you in the wrong direction.

nid0,"Generally, unless you have at least a modest understanding of server management, a reseller hosting service is going to be the way to go.

A VPS is always an option but even if you pay for a system that provides management you're going to find that you need at least some level of administering the system yourself, whereas if you take out a reseller account all ""server-side"" management and administration is taken care of for you.

As with everything though the provider you choose is everything. Reseller services range from absolutely terrible and crammed onto overflowing servers with support who don't care unless the server's down, to excellent service with prompt knowledgeable support that'll help you with a full range of day-to-day issues like assisting with onboarding your clients and in some cases provide additional tools which may or may not be extremely useful (such as integrated billing platforms for you to bill your clients).

I_AM_NOT_A_WOMBAT,"VPS or reseller, depending on your level of comfort being a sysadmin, as others have noted. It sounds like you're a web developer who wants to offer hosting either as a benefit to your clients and/or to earn a little extra cash on the side. If so (and congrats on having and maintaining 50 clients), if you go the VPS route, keep in mind that running the server, keeping it secure, and installing patches, etc. is going to take away from your development time. Generally you'll make a lot more money billing development hours than whatever you'll get as a flat monthly fee for hosting, unless you charge a base rate for hosting that makes you whole whether you do any dev or not.

Another thing you may want to consider is with all your clients on one server, if that server goes down you're going to get a lot of calls and emails if your clients care about uptime. You might want to segment your clients across a couple of data centers or even a couple of different hosts to mitigate the risk of everybody going down at once. Many web hosts have servers in multiple locations, and normally you can specify the datacenter you want when you place the order.

FWIW, as a webdev I make my clients pay for their own hosting. I run servers but not for my clients because if the server goes down at 3am I don't want to be the one who has to deal with it. I also don't want to be billing tiny dollar amounts each month and chasing down the inevitable expired credit cards, declines, and other random things for a few dollars a month. Granted with 50+ clients the dollars might make more sense, but the more transactions you add the more issues you'll have each month.",1512440662.0
