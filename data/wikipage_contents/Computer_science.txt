{{Science}}

'''Computer science''' is the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of [[computer]]s. It involves the study of [[algorithm]]s that process, store, and communicate [[digital data|digital]] [[information]]. A [[computer scientist]] specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=computer%20scientist |title=WordNet Search—3.1 |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref>

Its fields can be divided into a variety of theoretical and [[practical disciplines]]. Some fields, such as [[computational complexity theory]] (which explores the fundamental properties of [[Computational problem|computational]] and intractable problems), are highly abstract, while fields such as [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]] emphasize real-world visual applications. Other fields focus on challenges in implementing computation. For example, [[programming language theory]] considers various approaches to the description of computation, while the study of [[computer programming]] itself investigates various aspects of the use of [[programming language]]s and [[complex systems]]. [[Human–computer interaction]] considers the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and [[Computer accessibility|universally accessible]] to humans.

[[File:Babbage40.png|upright|thumb|[[Charles Babbage]], sometimes referred to as the "father of computing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbi.umn.edu/about/babbage.html|title=Charles Babbage Institute: Who Was Charles Babbage?|website=cbi.umn.edu|access-date=28 December 2016}}</ref> ]]

The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern [[digital computer]]. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the [[abacus]] have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. Further, [[algorithm]]s for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.

[[Wilhelm Schickard]] designed and constructed the first working [[mechanical calculator]] in 1623.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wilhelm Schickard – Ein Computerpionier|url=http://www.fmi.uni-jena.de/fmimedia/Fakultaet/Institute+und+Abteilungen/Abteilung+f%C3%BCr+Didaktik/GDI/Wilhelm+Schickard.pdf|language = German}}</ref> In 1673, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the [[Stepped Reckoner]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Computing|url=http://blogs.royalsociety.org/history-of-science/2012/06/25/history-of-computing/|first = Fiona|last = Keates|work = The Repository|publisher = The Royal Society|date = 25 June 2012}}</ref> He may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, for, among other reasons, documenting the binary number system. In 1820, [[Charles Xavier Thomas|Thomas de Colmar]] launched the [[mechanical calculator]] industry<ref group=note>In 1851</ref> when he released his simplified [[arithmometer]], which was the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. [[Charles Babbage]] started the design of the first ''automatic mechanical calculator'', his [[Difference Engine]], in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first ''programmable mechanical calculator'', his [[Analytical Engine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/babbage/index.asp |title=Science Museum—Introduction to Babbage |accessdate=24 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908054017/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/babbage/index.asp |archivedate=September 8, 2006}}</ref> He started developing this machine in 1834, and "in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the [[wikt:Special:Search/salient|salient]] features of the modern computer".<ref name="Hyman1982">{{cite book |author=Anthony Hyman |title=Charles Babbage, pioneer of the computer |year=1982}}</ref> "A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the [[Jacquard loom]]"<ref name="Hyman1982" /> making it infinitely programmable.<ref group=note>"The introduction of punched cards into the new engine was important not only as a more convenient form of control than the drums, or because programs could now be of unlimited extent, and could be stored and repeated without the danger of introducing errors in setting the machine by hand; it was important also because it served to crystallize Babbage's feeling that he had invented something really new, something much more than a sophisticated calculating machine." [[#COLLIER|Bruce Collier]], 1970</ref> In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, [[Ada Lovelace]] wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the [[Bernoulli number]]s, which is considered to be the first computer program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottlan.edu/Lriddle/women/ada-love.htm |title=A Selection and Adaptation From Ada's Notes found in Ada, The Enchantress of Numbers," by Betty Alexandra Toole Ed.D.

In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage's impossible dream, [[Howard H. Aiken|Howard Aiken]] convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business<ref>"In this sense Aiken needed IBM, whose technology included the use of punched cards, the accumulation of numerical data, and the transfer of numerical data from one register to another", [[#AIKEN|Bernard Cohen]], p.44 (2000)</ref> to develop his giant programmable calculator, the [[Harvard Mark I|ASCC/Harvard Mark I]], based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit. When the machine was finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".<ref>[[#ORIGINS|Brian Randell]], p. 187, 1975</ref>

During the 1940s, as new and more powerful [[computing]] machines were developed, the term ''computer'' came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.<ref>The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) was founded in 1947.</ref> As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study [[computation]] in general.

===Contributions===
[[File:Enigma.jpg|thumb|upright|The German military used the [[Enigma machine]] (shown here) during [[World War II]] for communications they wanted kept secret. The large-scale decryption of Enigma traffic at [[Bletchley Park]] was an important factor that contributed to Allied victory in WWII.<ref name="kahnbook"/>]]

Despite its short history as a formal academic discipline, computer science has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and society—in fact, along with [[electronics]], it is a founding science of the current epoch of human history called the [[Information Age]] and a driver of the [[information revolution]], seen as the third major leap in human technological progress after the [[Industrial Revolution]] (1750–1850 CE) and the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] (8000–5000 BC).

The latter includes essential design software for [[integrated circuit]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
* [[Artificial intelligence]] is becoming increasingly important as it gets more efficient and complex. There are many applications of AI, some of which can be seen at home, such as [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]s. It is also present in video games and on the modern battlefield in drones, anti-missile systems, and [[Legged Squad Support System|squad support robots]].
* [[Human–computer interaction]] combines novel algorithms with design strategies that enable rapid human performance, low error rates, ease in learning, and high satisfaction. Researchers use ethnographic observation and automated data collection to understand user needs, then conduct usability tests to refine designs. Key innovations include the [[direct manipulation]], selectable web links, [[touchscreen]] designs, mobile applications, and [[virtual reality]].

Although first proposed in 1956,<ref name="Tedre2014"/> the term "computer science" appears in a 1959 article in ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'',<ref name="Fine_1959">

in which Louis Fein argues for the creation of a ''Graduate School in Computer Sciences'' analogous to the creation of [[Harvard Business School]] in 1921,<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanford University Oral History|url=http://library.stanford.edu/guides/stanford-university-oral-history|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref> justifying the name by arguing that, like [[management science]], the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature, while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline.<ref name="Fine_1959"/>
His efforts, and those of others such as [[numerical analysis|numerical analyst]] [[George Forsythe]], were rewarded: universities went on to create such programs, starting with Purdue in 1962.<ref>[[Donald Knuth]] (1972).

Because of this, several alternative names have been proposed.<ref>{{cite web |author=Matti Tedre |year=2006 |url=http://epublications.uef.fi/pub/urn_isbn_952-458-867-6/urn_isbn_952-458-867-6.pdf |title=The Development of Computer Science: A Sociocultural Perspective |page=260 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> Certain departments of major universities prefer the term ''computing science'', to emphasize precisely that difference. Danish scientist [[Peter Naur]] suggested the term ''datalogy'',<ref>
{{cite journal
 |author=Peter Naur
 |year=1966

The first scientific institution to use the term was the Department of Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1969, with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy. The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries. An alternative term, also proposed by Naur, is [[data science]]; this is now used for a distinct field of data analysis, including statistics and databases.

Also, in the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the ''Communications of the ACM''—''turingineer'', ''turologist'', ''flow-charts-man'', ''applied meta-mathematician'', and ''applied [[epistemology|epistemologist]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Communications of the ACM |date=<!-- missing! --> |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=6| doi = 10.1145/368796.368802|last1=Weiss |first1=E.A. |last2=Corley |first2=Henry P.T. }}</ref> Three months later in the same journal, ''comptologist'' was suggested, followed next year by ''hypologist''.<ref>Communications of the ACM 2(1):p.4</ref> The term ''computics'' has also been suggested.<ref>IEEE Computer 28(12): p.136</ref> {{anchor|Name of the field in Europe}}In Europe, terms derived from contracted translations of the expression "automatic information" (e.g. "informazione automatica" in Italian) or "information and mathematics" are often used, e.g. ''informatique'' (French), ''Informatik'' (German), ''informatica'' (Italian, Dutch), ''informática'' (Spanish, Portuguese), ''informatika'' ([[Slavic languages]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) or ''pliroforiki'' (''πληροφορική'', which means informatics) in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Similar words have also been adopted in the UK (as in ''the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh'').<ref>P. Mounier-Kuhn, ''L'Informatique en France, de la seconde guerre mondiale au Plan Calcul. L'émergence d'une science'', Paris, PUPS, 2010, ch. 3 & 4.</ref>

A folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—[[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]], states that "computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."<ref group=note>See the entry
"[[q:Computer science|Computer science]]" on Wikiquote for the history of this quotation.</ref> The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. For example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of [[computer engineering]], while the study of commercial [[computer system]]s and their deployment is often called information technology or [[information system]]s. However, there has been much cross-fertilization of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as philosophy, [[cognitive science]], [[computational linguistics|linguistics]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[computational statistics|statistics]], and [[logic]].

Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science.<ref name="Denning_cs_discipline" /> Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alan Turing]], [[Rózsa Péter]] and [[Alonzo Church]] and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as [[mathematical logic]], [[category theory]], [[domain theory]], and [[algebra]].<ref name="Tedre2014"/>

The relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by [[Software engineer#Use of the title "Engineer"|disputes]] over what the term "software engineering" means, and how computer science is defined.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Tedre | first1 = M. | title = Computing as a Science: A Survey of Competing Viewpoints | doi = 10.1007/s11023-011-9240-4 | journal = Minds and Machines | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–387 | year = 2011 }}</ref> [[David Parnas]], taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Parnas | first1 = D.L. | journal = Annals of Software Engineering | volume = 6 | pages = 19–37 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1023/A:1018949113292|title=Software engineering programmes are not computer science programmes}}, p. 19: "Rather than treat software engineering as a subfield of computer science, I treat it as an element of the set, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, […]"</ref>

The academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis. Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with [[computational science]]. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.

==Philosophy==

A number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science. [[Peter Wegner]] argued that those paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics.<ref>{{cite conference |author=Wegner, P. |title=Research paradigms in computer science—Proceedings of the 2nd international Conference on Software Engineering |location=San Francisco, California, United States |date=October 13–15, 1976 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA}}</ref> [[Peter J.

In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science.<ref name="CSAB1997"/>

===Theoretical computer science===
{{main|Theoretical computer science}}
''Theoretical Computer Science'' is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. Its aim is to understand the nature of '''computation''' and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies. All studies related to mathematical, logic and formal concepts and methods could be considered as theoretical computer science, provided that the motivation is clearly drawn from the field of '''computing'''.

====Data structures and algorithms====
Data structures and algorithms are the study of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency.

====Theory of computation====
{{main|Theory of computation}}
According to [[Peter J. Denning|Peter Denning]], the fundamental question underlying computer science is, "What can be (efficiently) automated?"<ref name="Denning_cs_discipline">{{cite journal | last=Denning | first=Peter J. | authorlink=Peter J. Denning | year=2000 | title=Computer Science: The Discipline | url=http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/dif8916/denning.pdf | journal=Encyclopedia of Computer Science | format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060525195404/http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/dif8916/denning.pdf |archivedate = May 25, 2006}}</ref> Theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. In an effort to answer the first question, [[computability theory]] examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical [[models of computation]]. The second question is addressed by [[computational complexity theory]], which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems.

The famous [[P versus NP problem|P = NP?]] problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]],<ref>[http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute] P = NP {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014194456/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ |date=October 14, 2013 }}</ref> is an open problem in the theory of computation.

====Information and coding theory====
{{main|Information theory|Coding theory}}
Information theory is related to the quantification of information. This was developed by [[Claude Shannon]] to find fundamental limits on [[signal processing]] operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 14, 2002 |last=P. Collins |first=Graham |title=Claude E. Shannon: Founder of Information Theory |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=claude-e-shannon-founder |work=Scientific American |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref>
Coding theory is the study of the properties of [[code]]s (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for [[data compression]], [[cryptography]], [[error detection and correction]], and more recently also for [[Linear network coding|network coding]]. Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable [[data transmission]] methods.

====Programming language theory====
{{main|Programming language theory}}
Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of [[programming language]]s and their individual [[Programming language#Elements|features]]. It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting [[mathematics]], software engineering, and [[linguistics]]. It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.

====Formal methods====
{{main|Formal methods}}
Formal methods are a particular kind of [[Mathematics|mathematically]] based technique for the [[formal specification|specification]], development and [[formal verification|verification]] of software and [[computer hardware|hardware]] systems. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and [[life-critical system]]s, where safety or [[computer security|security]] is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of [[theoretical computer science]] fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.

===Computer systems===

====Computer architecture and computer engineering====
{{main|Computer architecture|Computer engineering}}
Computer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory.<ref>{{cite web|last=A. Thisted|first=Ronald|title=Computer Architecture |url=http://galton.uchicago.edu/~thisted/Distribute/comparch.pdf|publisher=The University of Chicago|date=April 7, 1997}}</ref> The field often involves disciplines of computer engineering and electrical engineering, selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance, and cost goals.

====Computer performance analysis====
{{main|Computer performance}}
Computer performance analysis is the study of work flowing through computers with the general goals of improving [[throughput]], controlling [[Response time (technology)|response time]], using resources efficiently, eliminating [[bottleneck (software)|bottleneck]]s, and predicting performance under anticipated peak loads.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wescott | first = Bob | title = The Every Computer Performance Book, Chapter 3: Useful laws  | publisher = [[CreateSpace]] | date = 2013 | isbn = 978-1482657753}}</ref>

====Concurrent, parallel and distributed systems====
{{main|Concurrency (computer science)|Distributed computing}}
Concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other. A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including [[Petri net]]s, [[Process calculus|process calculi]] and the [[Parallel random-access machine|Parallel Random Access Machine]] model. A distributed system extends the idea of concurrency onto multiple computers connected through a network. Computers within the same distributed system have their own private memory, and information is often exchanged among themselves to achieve a common goal.

====Computer networks====
{{main|Computer network}}
This branch of computer science aims to manage networks between computers worldwide.

====Computer security and cryptography====
{{main|Computer security|Cryptography}}
Computer security is a branch of computer technology with an objective of protecting information from unauthorized access, disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users. [[Cryptography]] is the practice and study of hiding (encryption) and therefore deciphering (decryption) information. Modern cryptography is largely related to computer science, for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity.

====Databases====
{{main|Database}}
{{Missing information|a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.|date=September 2018}}
A database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through [[database model]]s and [[query language]]s.

====Informatics practices====  <!-- Redirect target of [[Informatics Practices]] -->
''Informatics practices'' (IP) is a field of software-related study. The course mainly covers [[Coding theory|coding]], software and networking concepts. This field is comparable to computer science, but lacks the [[computer hardware|hardware]] concepts, while focusing more on [[computer network|networking]] concepts than computer science. This branch of [[information science]] and computer science mainly focuses on the study of [[information processing]], particularly with respect to [[system integration]] and human interactions with machine and data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbseacademic.nic.in/web_material/Curriculum19/Main-SeniorSecondary/15_Information_Practices_New.pdf|title=Informatics Practices (New)|website=Central Board of Secondary Education|accessdate=8 Oct 2018}}</ref>

===Computer applications===

====Computer graphics and visualization====
{{main|Computer graphics (computer science)}}
Computer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data. The study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including [[computer vision]], [[image processing]], and [[computational geometry]], and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and [[video games]].

====Human–computer interaction====
{{main|Human–computer interaction}}
Research that develops theories, principles, and guidelines for user interface designers, so they can create satisfactory user experiences with desktop, laptop, and mobile devices.

====Scientific computing====
[[Scientific computing]] (or [[computational science]]) is the field of study concerned with constructing [[scientific modelling|mathematical models]] and [[numerical analysis|quantitative analysis]] techniques and using computers to analyze and solve [[Science|scientific]] problems. In practical use, it is typically the application of [[computer simulation]] and other forms of [[computation]] to problems in various scientific disciplines.

====Artificial intelligence====
{{main|Artificial intelligence}}
Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals. From its origins in [[cybernetics]] and in the [[History of artificial intelligence|Dartmouth Conference]] (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as [[applied mathematics]], [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[semiotics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[neurophysiology]], and [[social intelligence]]. AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was [[Alan Turing]]'s question "Can computers think?", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.

===Software engineering===
{{main|Software engineering}}
{{see also|Computer programming}}
Software engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build. It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it doesn't just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal maintenance and arrangement.

==The great insights of computer science==
The philosopher of computing [[William J. Rapaport|Bill Rapaport]] noted three ''Great Insights of Computer Science'':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/computation.html|title=What Is Computation?|publisher=State University of New York at Buffalo|last = Rapaport|first = William J.|date = 20 September 2013}}</ref>
* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s, [[George Boole]]'s, [[Alan Turing]]'s, [[Claude Shannon]]'s, and [[Samuel Morse]]'s insight: there are only ''two objects'' that a computer has to deal with in order to represent "anything".{{refn |group="note"|The word "anything" is written in quotation marks because there are things that computers cannot do. One example is: to answer the question if an arbitrary given computer program will eventually finish or run forever (the [[Halting problem]]).}}
:: All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as "on/off", "magnetized/de-magnetized", "high-voltage/low-voltage", etc.).
{{see also|Digital physics}}
* [[Alan Turing]]'s insight: there are only ''five actions'' that a computer has to perform in order to do "anything".
:: Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:
::* move left one location;
::* move right one location;
::* read symbol at current location;
::* print 0 at current location;
::* print 1 at current location.
{{see also|Turing machine}}
* [[Corrado Böhm]] and [[Giuseppe Jacopini]]'s insight: there are only ''three ways of combining'' these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do "anything".
:: Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:
::* ''sequence'': first do this, then do that;
::* '' selection'': IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;
::* ''repetition'': WHILE such-and-such is the case DO this.
:: Note that the three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of [[goto]] (which means it is more elementary than [[structured programming]]).

==Academia==
{{further|List of computer science conferences|Category:Computer science journals}}
Conferences are important events for computer science research. During these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet. Unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of [[proceedings|conference papers]] is greater than that of journal publications.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Bertrand|title=Viewpoint: Research evaluation for computer science|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=April 2009|volume=25|issue=4|pages=31–34|doi=10.1145/1498765.1498780}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=David|title=Evaluating Computer Scientists and Engineers For Promotion and Tenure|url=http://cra.org/resources/bp-view/evaluating_computer_scientists_and_engineers_for_promotion_and_tenure/|publisher=Computing Research Association|date=August 1999}}</ref> One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fortnow|first1=Lance|title=Viewpoint: Time for Computer Science to Grow Up|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=August 2009|volume=52|issue=8|pages=33–35|doi=10.1145/1536616.1536631|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/fulltext}}</ref>

==Programming paradigms==
{{main|Programming paradigm}}

Programming languages can be leveraged as tools to accomplish a variety of tasks. Therefore, different programming paradigms exist. A few basic programming paradigms used throughout computer science are:

* [[Object-oriented programming|Object-Oriented Programming]]: "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another."
* [[Imperative programming|Imperative Programming]]: "In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates."<ref>{{Citation|title=Imperative programming|date=2018-10-07|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imperative_programming&oldid=862960283|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>
* [[Functional programming|Functional Programming]]: "In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements."<ref>{{Citation|title=Functional programming|date=2018-10-06|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Functional_programming&oldid=862736578|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>
* [[Procedural programming|Procedural Programming]]: "Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions (not to be confused with mathematical functions, but similar to those used in functional programming), simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out."<ref>{{Citation|title=Procedural programming|date=2018-09-09|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Procedural_programming&oldid=858695015|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>

Most programming languages offer support for multiple programming paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Multi-Paradigm Programming Language |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |website=developer.mozilla.org |publisher=[[Mozilla Foundation]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821052407/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |archive-date=21 August 2013}}</ref>

==Education==
Since computer science is a relatively new field, it is not as widely taught in schools and universities as other academic subjects. For example, in 2014, [[Code.org]] estimated that only 10 percent of high schools in the United States offered computer science education.<ref>{{cite news|title=Computer Science: Not Just an Elective Anymore|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/02/26/22computer_ep.h33.html|work=Education Week|date=February 25, 2014}}</ref> A 2010 report by Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) revealed that only 14 out of 50 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science.<ref>{{cite web|title=Running on Empty: The Failure to Teach K–12 Computer Science in the Digital Age |url = http://runningonempty.acm.org/fullreport2.pdf | date= 2010|first1 =Cameron |last1=Wilson|publisher = ACM|first2=Leigh Ann|last2= Sudol|first3= Chris|last3 =Stephenson|first4 =Mark |last4=Stehlik}}</ref> However, computer science education is growing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/|title=How to Teach Computational Thinking—Stephen Wolfram Blog|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|access-date=16 September 2016}}</ref> Some countries, such as Israel, New Zealand and South Korea, have already included computer science in their respective national secondary education curriculum.<ref>{{cite news|title=A is for algorithm|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21601250-global-push-more-computer-science-classrooms-starting-bear-fruit|work=The Economist|date=April 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Computing at School International comparisons|url=http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/data/uploads/internationalcomparisons-v5.pdf|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}</ref> Several countries are following suit.<ref>{{cite news|title=Adding Coding to the Curriculum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/world/europe/adding-coding-to-the-curriculum.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 23, 2014}}</ref>

In most countries, there is a significant gender gap in computer science education. For example, in the US about 20% of computer science degrees in 2012 were conferred to women.<ref>{{cite web|title=Percentage of Bachelor's degrees conferred to women, by major (1970-2012) |url = http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelors-degrees-conferred-to-women-by-major-1970-2012/|accessdate=July 20, 2015|date = 14 June 2014}}</ref> This gender gap also exists in other Western countries.<ref name="gender">{{cite web|title=IT gender gap: Where are the female programmers? |url =http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/it-gender-gap-where-are-the-female-programmers/|first = Justin |last = James |work = TechRepublic}}</ref> However, in some parts of the world, the gap is small or nonexistent. In 2011, approximately half of all computer science degrees in [[Malaysia]] were conferred to women.<ref>{{cite web|title=what gender is science|url=http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/mariacharles/documents/WhatGenderisScience.pdf|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}</ref> In 2001, women made up 54.5% of computer science graduates in [[Guyana]].<ref name="gender"/>

** "Covering a period from 1966 to 1993, its interest lies not only in the content of each of these papers – still timely today – but also in their being put together so that ideas expressed at different times complement each other nicely." (N. Bernard, ''Zentralblatt MATH'')
