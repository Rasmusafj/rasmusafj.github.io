HTML 5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,<ref name="HTML5v1" /> with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.<ref name="finalars" /><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/4167 |title=HTML5 is a W3C recommendation |work=W3C Blog |publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) |date=28 October 2014 |access-date=28 October 2014}}</ref> Its goals are to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as [[Web browser]]s, [[Parsing|parsers]], etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain [[Backward compatibility|backward-compatible]] with older software.

HTML replaces these documents. |at="Introduction"}}</ref> the HTML 4 and XHTML specs were announced as ''superseded'' by HTML 5.2 on 27 March 2018.<ref>The 27 March 2018 ''superseded'' date appears on the legacy specification pages of [https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/ HTML 4.1], [https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/ XHTML 1.1], and earlier versions; the [https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/ DOM 4] spec is not marked as superseded, nor is even the [https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20030109/ DOM 2] spec, {{as of|lc=y|2018|07|post=.}}</ref>

HTML 5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) for complex [[web application]]s.<ref name="HTML5diffHTML4">{{cite web |title=HTML5 Differences from HTML4 |url= https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/ |work=W3.org |publisher=[[W3C]] |date=19 October 2010 |access-date=4 December 2010}}</ref> For the same reasons, HTML 5 is also [[HTML5 in mobile devices|a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications]], because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

Many new [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntactic]] features are included. To natively include and handle [[multimedia]] and [[2D computer graphics|graphical]] content, the new [[HTML5 video|{{tag|video|o}}]], [[HTML5 Audio|{{tag|audio|o}}]] and [[Canvas element|{{tag|canvas|o}}]] [[HTML element|elements]] were added, and support for scalable vector graphics ([[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]) content and [[MathML]] for mathematical formulas. To enrich the [[Semantic Web|semantic]] content of documents, new page structure elements such as {{tag|main|o}}, {{tag|section|o}}, [[Article element (HTML5)|{{tag|article|o}}]], {{tag|header|o}}, {{tag|footer|o}}, {{tag|aside|o}}, {{tag|nav|o}}, and {{tag|figure|o}} are added. New [[HTML attribute|attributes]] are introduced, some elements and attributes have been removed, and others such as {{tag|a|s}}, {{tag|cite|o}}, and {{tag|menu|o}} have been changed, redefined, or standardized.

The APIs and [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) are now fundamental parts of the HTML 5 specification<ref name="HTML5diffHTML4" /> and HTML 5 also better defines the processing for any invalid documents.<ref>{{cite web |title=HTML 5.2 W3C Recommendation |at=§ 1.10.2 Syntax Errors |url= https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/introduction.html#syntax-errors |work=W3.org |publisher=[[W3C]] |date=14 December 2017 |access-date=29 June 2017}}</ref>

==History==
The [[Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group]] (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004. At that time, HTML&nbsp;4.01 had not been updated since 2000,<ref>{{cite web|title=HTML&nbsp;4 Errata|url=https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html4-updates/errata|publisher= [[World Wide Web Consortium]] |accessdate=4 December 2010}}</ref> and the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) was focusing future developments on [[XHTML 2.0|XHTML&nbsp;2.0]]. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it.<ref name="W3C hist" />

The [[Mozilla Foundation]] and [[Opera Software]] presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) workshop in June 2004,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/papers/opera.html |title=Position Paper for the W3C Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents |work=W3.org |publisher=[[W3C]] |access-date=30 December 2011}}</ref> focusing on developing technologies that are backward-compatible with existing browsers,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/minutes-20040601.html#topic18.1 |title=W3C Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents (Day 1) |date=1 June 2004 |work=W3.org |publisher=[[W3C]] |access-date=30 December 2011}}</ref> including an initial draft specification of Web Forms 2.0. The workshop concluded with a vote—8 for, 14 against—for continuing work on HTML.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/minutes-20040602.html#topic28.1 |title=W3C Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents (Day 2) |date=2 June 2004 ||work=W3.org |publisher=[[W3C]] |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> Immediately after the workshop, WHATWG was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web Applications 1.0, was also announced.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2004Jun/0000.html |title=&#91whatwg&#93; WHAT open mailing list announcement |first=-Ian |last=Hickson |author-link=Ian Hickson |work=Lists.W3.org |publisher=[[W3C]] |date=5 June 2004 |access-date=8 December 2015}}</ref> The two specifications were later merged to form HTML 5.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://blog.whatwg.org/this-week-in-html-5-episode-5 |title=This Week in HTML 5 – Episode 5 |first=Mark |last=Pilgrim |author-link=Mark Pilgrim |work=WHATWG Blog |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=15 September 2008 |access-date=30 December 2011}}</ref> The HTML 5 specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W3C in 2007.

WHATWG's [[Ian Hickson]] ([[Google]]) and [[Dave Hyatt|David Hyatt]] ([[Apple Inc.|Apple]]) produced W3C's first public working draft of the specification on 22 January 2008.<ref name="HTML5v1">{{cite web |url= https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080122/ |title=HTML5: A vocabulary and associated APIs for HTML and XHTML |date=22 January 2008 |work=W3.org |publisher=[[W3C]] |access-date=28 January 2009 }}</ref>

=== "Thoughts on Flash" ===

While some features of HTML 5 are often compared to [[Adobe Flash]], the two technologies are very different. Both include features for playing audio and video within web pages, and for using [[Scalable Vector Graphics]]. However, HTML 5 on its own cannot be used for animation or interactivity&nbsp;– it must be supplemented with [[CSS3]] or [[JavaScript]]. There are many Flash capabilities that have no direct counterpart in HTML 5 (see [[Comparison of HTML5 and Flash]]). HTML 5's interactive capabilities became a topic of mainstream media attention around April 2010<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/04/29/flash-iphone-apples-steve-jobs-finally-explains/|title=FOX News: No Flash on the iPhone?

=== Last call, candidacy, and recommendation stages ===

On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML 5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML 5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.<ref name="w3c2014">{{cite web

|accessdate=18 February 2011
|date=14 February 2011}}</ref> In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" specification ''HTML Living Standard". The W3C nevertheless continued its project to release HTML 5.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blog.whatwg.org/html-is-the-new-html5 |title=HTML Is the New HTML5|last=Hickson |first=Ian |author-link=Ian Hickson |access-date=21 January 2011}}</ref>

In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML 5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered as a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization continues its work with HTML 5 as a "living standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.<ref name="splits">{{cite web |url= http://www.netmagazine.com/news/html5-gets-splits-122102 |title=HTML5 gets the splits |work=NetMagazine.com |access-date=23 July 2012 }}</ref>

In December 2012, W3C designated HTML 5 as a Candidate Recommendation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-html5-20121217/ |title=HTML5 |publisher=W3.org |date=2012-12-17 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref> The criterion for advancement to [[World Wide Web Consortium#W3C Recommendation (REC)|W3C Recommendation]] is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".<ref name="W3Crec">{{cite web

=== W3C and WHATWG conflict ===
W3C and WHATWG have been characterized as both working together on the development of HTML 5,<ref name="W3C hist">{{cite web |title=HTML 5.2 W3C Recommendation |at=§ 1.4 History |url= https://www.w3.org/TR/html/introduction.html#introduction-history |work=W3.org |publisher=[[W3C]] |date=14 December 2017 |access-date=9 August 2017}}</ref> and yet also at cross purposes<ref name="splits" /><ref name=finalars /> ever since the July 2012 split of the W3C work into milestone-based static standards and WHATWG's into a continually updated "living standard".  The relationship has been described as "fragile", even a "rift",<ref name="tale">{{cite web |title=A Tale of Two Standards |first=Jay |last=Hoffmann |work=The History of the Web |date=2017 |url= https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/when-standards-divide/ |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170901211055/https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/when-standards-divide/ |archive-date=1 September 2017 |access-date=26 January 2018}} (Original title: "When Standards Divide".)</ref> and characterized by "squabbling".<ref name="finalars">{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/html5-specification-finalized-squabbling-over-who-writes-the-specs-continues/ |title=HTML5 specification finalized, squabbling over specs continues |publisher=Ars Technica |date=29 October 2014 |access-date=29 October 2014}}</ref>

In at least one case, namely the permissible content of the {{tag|[[HTML elements#cite|cite]]|o}} element, the two specifications directly contradict each other ({{as of|lc=y|2018|07|post=),}} with the W3C definition being permissive and reflecting traditional use of the element since its introduction,<ref>{{cite web |at=§ 4.5.6. The cite element |title=HTML 5.2 W3C Recommendation |date=14 December 2017 |work=W3.org |publisher=[[W3C]] |url= https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/textlevel-semantics.html#the-cite-element |access-date=26 July 2018}}</ref> but WHATWG limiting it to a single defined type of content (the title of the work cited).<ref>{{cite web |at=§ 4.5.6 The cite element |title=HTML Living Standard |date=25 July 2018 |work=HTML.spec.WHATWG.org |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |url= https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-cite-element |access-date=26 July 2018}}</ref>  This is actually at odds with WHATWG's stated goals of ensuring [[backward compatibility]]<ref>{{cite web |at=§ 1.6 History |title=HTML Living Standard |date=25 July 2018 |work=HTML.spec.WHATWG.org |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |url= https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#history-2 |access-date=26 July 2018}}</ref> and not losing prior functionality.<ref name="splits" />

The "Introduction" section in the WHATWG spec (edited by [[Ian Hickson|Ian "Hixie" Hickson]]) is critical of W3C, e.g "{{em|Note:}} Although we have asked them to stop doing so, the W3C also republishes some parts of this specification as separate documents." In its "History" subsection it portrays W3C as resistant to Hickson's and WHATWG's original HTML 5 plans, then jumping on the bandwagon belatedly (though Hickson was in control of the W3C HTML 5 spec, too). Regardless, it indicates a major philosophical divide between the organizations:<ref>{{cite web |at=§ 1 Introduction; §1.6 History |title=HTML Living Standard |date=25 July 2018 |work=HTML.spec.WHATWG.org |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |url= https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#introduction |access-date=26 July 2018}}</ref>
{{quote|<p>For a number of years, both groups then worked together. In 2011, however, the groups came to the conclusion that they had different goals: the W3C wanted to publish a "finished" version of "HTML5", while the WHATWG wanted to continue working on a Living Standard for HTML, continuously maintaining the specification rather than freezing it in a state with known problems, and adding new features as needed to evolve the platform.</p><p>Since then, the WHATWG has been working on this specification (amongst others), and the W3C has been copying fixes made by the WHATWG into their fork of the document (which also has other changes).</p>
}}

The "markets" for the two specifications are largely different. The W3C spec is the one that Web developers most often refer to,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} while the WHATWG version is used by the software development teams of the browser makers (though a version exists for Web content authors, trimmed of the material only of interest to browser coders<ref name="WHATWG LS DE" />). New features are added to HTML and, often experimentally, to browsers long before they appear in a W3C spec, because they arise in the WHATWG one.<ref name="tale" /> The technology journal ''[[Ars Technica]]'' observed that "both groups are likely to continue to exist, and both groups will continue to have broad-based industry backing".<ref name="finalars" />

==== Differences between the two standards ====

In addition to the contradiction in the {{tag|[[HTML elements#cite|cite]]|o}} element mentioned above, other differences between the two standards include at least the following, as of September 2018:

== Features and APIs ==
{{Update|section|reason=Last sentence marks 2016 as the future instead of past|date=October 2018}}
The W3C proposed a greater reliance on modularity as a key part of the plan to make faster progress, meaning identifying specific features, either proposed or already existing in the spec, and advancing them as separate specifications. Some technologies that were originally defined in HTML 5 itself are now defined in separate specifications:
* HTML Working Group&nbsp;– HTML Canvas 2D Context;
* Web Apps Working Group&nbsp;– [[Web Messaging]], [[Web worker]]s, [[Web storage]], [[WebSocket]], [[Server-sent events]], [[Web Components]]<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/PubStatus |title=PubStatus – WEBAPPS |work=W3.org |publisher=[[W3C]]}}</ref> (this was not part of HTML 5, though); the Web Applications Working Group was closed in October 2015 and its deliverables transferred to the Web Platform Working Group (WPWG).
* IETF HyBi Working Group&nbsp;– WebSocket Protocol;
* WebRTC Working Group&nbsp;– [[WebRTC]];
* Web Media Text Tracks Community Group&nbsp;– [[WebVTT]].

After the standardization of the HTML 5 specification in October 2014,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/ |title=HTML5: A Vocabulary and Associated APIs for HTML and XHTML |accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref> the core vocabulary and features are being extended in four ways.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lesliesikos.com/html5-became-a-standard-html-5-1-and-html-5-2-on-the-way/ |title=HTML5 Became a Standard, HTML 5.1 and HTML 5.2 on the Way |author=Leslie Sikos |accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref> Likewise, some features that were removed from the original HTML 5 specification have been standardized separately as modules, such as [[Microdata (HTML)|Microdata]] and [[Canvas element|Canvas]]. Technical specifications introduced as HTML 5 extensions such as [[Polyglot markup|Polyglot Markup]] have also been standardized as modules. Some W3C specifications that were originally separate specifications have been adapted as HTML 5 extensions or features, such as SVG. Some features that might have slowed down the standardization of HTML 5 will be standardized as upcoming specifications, instead. HTML 5.1 is expected to be finalized in 2016, and it is currently on the standardization track at the W3C.

==Features==

===Markup===
HTML 5 introduces [[HTML element|elements]] and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern [[website]]s. Some of them are semantic replacements for common uses of generic block ({{tag|div|open}}) and inline ({{tag|span|open}}) elements, for example {{tag|nav|open}} (website navigation block), {{tag|footer|open}} (usually referring to bottom of web page or to last lines of HTML code), or {{tag|audio|open}} and {{tag|video|open}} instead of {{tag|object|open}}.<ref>Introduction to HTML 5 [http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/introduction-html5-video/ video]</ref><ref>IBM Developer Works [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-html5/?ca=dgr-lnxw01NewHTML New elements in HTML5: Structure and semantics]</ref><ref>ICAMD.org [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003H05Q18 Finalcut Silverlight Films that Videographers share Quicktime in a Flash: Video on the Web using HTML5 and other Codecs]</ref>
Some deprecated elements from [[HTML&nbsp;4.01]] have been dropped, including purely presentational elements such as {{tag|font|open}} and {{tag|center|open}}, whose effects have long been superseded by the more capable [[Cascading Style Sheets]].<ref>
 {{cite web
 | url = https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/obsolete.html
 | title = 11 Obsolete features — HTML5
 | publisher = W3C
 | accessdate = 2014-03-11}}</ref> There is also a renewed emphasis on the importance of [[DOM scripting]]  in Web behavior.

The HTML 5 syntax is no longer based on [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]]<ref>[http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/html5-dtd.html HTML5 DTD]: "HTML5 is not SGML-based, and there will be no official DTD for it."</ref><ref>[https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/ HTML 5 Reference]: "Although it is inspired by its SGML origins, in practice, it really only shares minor syntactic similarities. ... As HTML5 is no longer formally based upon SGML, the DOCTYPE no longer serves this purpose, and thus no longer needs to refer to a DTD."</ref> despite the similarity of its markup. It has, however, been designed to be backward-compatible with common parsing of older versions of HTML. It comes with a new introductory line that looks like an SGML [[document type declaration]], <code style="white-space:nowrap;">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, which triggers the standards-compliant [[Quirks mode|rendering mode]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Shannon Suetos |date=26 April 2010 |url=http://www.instantshift.com/2010/04/26/html5-worth-the-hype/ |title=HTML5: Worth the Hype? |work=instantshift.com |accessdate=21 October 2012}}</ref>
Since 5 January 2009, HTML 5 also includes ''Web Forms 2.0'', a previously separate [[WHATWG]] specification.<ref>{{cite web|title=Web Forms 2.0|url=http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/|accessdate=2014-02-11|date=2009-01-05}} obsolescence notice</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html|title=HTML|work=whatwg.org}}</ref>

===New APIs===
[[File:HTML5 APIs and related technologies taxonomy and status.svg|thumb|420px|HTML5 related APIs<ref>Sergey Mavrody, ''Sergey's HTML5 & CSS3 Quick Reference'', 2nd ed. Belisso Corp., 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-9833867-2-8}}[javascript:]</ref>]]

In addition to specifying markup, HTML 5 specifies scripting [[application programming interfaces]] (APIs) that can be used with [[JavaScript]].<ref name="html4-differences"/> Existing [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) interfaces are extended and ''[[de facto]]'' features documented. There are also new APIs, such as:
* [[Canvas element|Canvas]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syntaxxx.com/get-started-with-html5-canvas/|title=Get Started with HTM Canvas|website= www.syntaxxx.com}}</ref>

* [[Microdata (HTML)|Microdata]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/microdata.html#microdata|title=HTML|work=whatwg.org}}</ref>
* [[Web Messaging]];<ref>{{cite web |url=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-messaging.html |title=Web Messaging specification |work=whatwg.org}}</ref>
* [[Web Storage]]&nbsp;– a key-value pair storage framework that provides behaviour similar to [[HTTP Cookie|cookies]] but with larger storage capacity and improved API.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html |title=Web Storage specification |work=whatwg.org}}</ref>

Not all of the above technologies are included in the W3C HTML 5 specification, though they are in the WHATWG HTML specification.<ref>{{cite web|author=href |url=http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/introduction.html#is-this-html5 |title=1 Introduction — HTML Standard |publisher=Whatwg.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}</ref> Some related technologies, which are not part of either the W3C HTML 5 or the WHATWG HTML specification, are as follows. The W3C publishes specifications for these separately:
* [[W3C Geolocation API|Geolocation]];
* [[IndexedDB]]&nbsp;– an indexed hierarchical key-value store (formerly WebSimpleDB);<ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/ "Indexed Database"]. [[World Wide Web Consortium]].</ref>
* [[HTML5 File API|File]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/ |title=File API |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}</ref>&nbsp;– an API intended to handle file uploads and file manipulation;<ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/ "File API"]. [[World Wide Web Consortium]].</ref>
* Directories and System&nbsp;– an API intended to satisfy client-side-storage use cases not well served by databases;<ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/file-system-api/ "Filesystem API"]. [[World Wide Web Consortium]].</ref>
* File Writer&nbsp;– an API for writing to files from web applications;<ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/file-writer-api/ "File API: Writer"]. [[World Wide Web Consortium]].</ref>
* [[HTML5 Audio#Web Audio API and MediaStream Processing API|Web Audio]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/ |title=Web Audio API |publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] |date= |accessdate=2018-03-02}}</ref>&nbsp;– a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications;

* [[Web cryptography API]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/|title=Web Cryptography API|website=www.w3.org}}</ref>
* [[WebRTC]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/|title=WebRTC 1.0: Real-time Communication Between Browsers|website=www.w3.org}}</ref>
* [[Web SQL Database]]&nbsp;– a local SQL Database (no longer maintained);<ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/ "Web SQL Database"]. [[World Wide Web Consortium]].</ref>

HTML 5 cannot provide animation within web pages. Additional JavaScript or [[CSS3]]  is necessary for animating HTML elements. Animation is also possible using JavaScript and HTML 4<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lynda.com/home/DisplayCourse.aspx?lpk2=67161|title=What HTML5 is (and what it isn't)|first=James|last=Williamson|year=2010|accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=January 2011}}, and within SVG elements through [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]], although browser support of the latter remains uneven as of 2011.

===XHTML 5 (XML-serialized HTML 5)===
XML documents must be served with an XML [[Internet media type]] (often called "[[MIME]] type") such as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>,<ref name="html4-differences">{{cite web|first1=Anne|last1=van Kesteren|first2=Simon|last2=Pieters|title=HTML5 differences from HTML4|url=https://html-differences.whatwg.org/#syntax|publisher= [[World Wide Web Consortium]] |accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> and must conform to strict, well-formed syntax of XML. XHTML 5 is simply XML-serialized HTML 5 data (that is, HTML 5 constrained to XHTML's strict requirements, e.g., not having any unclosed tags), sent with one of XML media types. HTML that has been written to conform to both the HTML and XHTML specifications&nbsp; and which will therefore produce the same DOM tree whether parsed as HTML or XML is known as [[polyglot markup|Polyglot markup]]<ref name="w3c">{{cite web|last=Graff|first=Eliot|title=Polyglot Markup: HTML-Compatible XHTML Documents|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/|publisher=W3C|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref>

===Error handling===
{{cite check|date=September 2017}}
HTML 5 is designed so that old browsers [[forward compatibility|can safely ignore]] new HTML 5 constructs.<ref name="HTML5diffHTML4"/> In contrast to HTML 4.01, the HTML 5 specification gives detailed rules for [[lexing]] and [[parsing]], with the intent that compliant browsers will produce the same results when parsing incorrect syntax.<ref name="whatfaq">{{cite web |url= http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Why_does_this_new_HTML_spec_legitimise_tag_soup.3F |title=FAQ – WHATWG Wiki |accessdate=26 August 2011 |work=WHATWG }}</ref> Although HTML 5 now defines a consistent behavior for "[[tag soup]]" documents, those documents are not regarded as conforming to the HTML 5 standard.<ref name="whatfaq"/>

===Popularity===
According to a report released on 30 September 2011, 34 of the world's top 100 Web sites were using HTML 5{{spaced ndash}}the adoption led by [[search engine]]s and [[social network]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Percentage of Web sites Using HTML5|url=http://www.binvisions.com/articles/how-many-percentage-web-sites-using-html5|publisher=binvisions|accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> Another report released in August 2013 has shown that 153 of the ''[[Fortune 500]]'' U.S. companies implemented HTML5 on their corporate websites.<ref>"[http://www.incore.com/Fortune500HTML5/#infographic HTML5 Popularity Among Fortune 500 Companies]". INCORE. Retrieved 5 March 2013.</ref>

Since 2014, HTML 5 is at least [[Comparison of layout engines (HTML5)|partially supported by most popular layout engines]].

===Differences from HTML&nbsp;4.01 and XHTML&nbsp;1.x===

==Logo==
[[File:HTML5-logo.svg|thumb|120px|The W3C HTML5 logo]]
On 18 January 2011, the W3C introduced a logo to represent the use of or interest in HTML 5. Unlike other badges previously issued by the W3C, it does not imply validity or conformance to a certain standard. As of 1 April 2011, this logo is official.<ref name="logo-faq">{{cite web | url = https://www.w3.org/html/logo/faq.html | title = W3C HTML5 Logo FAQ | publisher = [[World Wide Web Consortium]] | accessdate =21 January 2011 |quote = Is this W3C's "official" logo for HTML5?

When initially presenting it to the public, the W3C announced the HTML 5 logo as a "general-purpose visual identity for a broad set of open web technologies, including HTML 5, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], SVG, [[Web Open Font Format|WOFF]], and others".<ref name="waspopenletter">{{cite web | url = http://www.webstandards.org/2011/01/18/regarding-the-html5-logo | title = HTML5 Logo: Be Proud, But Don't Muddy the Waters! | publisher = [[The Web Standards Project]] | accessdate =22 January 2011 }}</ref> Some web standard advocates, including The Web Standards Project, criticized that definition of "HTML5" as an umbrella term, pointing out the blurring of terminology and the potential for miscommunication.<ref name="waspopenletter" /> Three days later, the W3C responded to community feedback and changed the logo's definition, dropping the enumeration of related technologies.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.w3.org/blog/2011/01/the-html5-logo-conversation/ | title = The HTML5 Logo Conversation | publisher = World Wide Web Consortium | accessdate =21 January 2011 }}</ref> The W3C then said the logo "represents HTML5, the cornerstone for modern Web applications".<ref name="logo-faq" />
