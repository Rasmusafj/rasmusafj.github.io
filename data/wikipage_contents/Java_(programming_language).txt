===Principles===
There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:<ref name="design_goals"/>

<!--NOTE: THESE 5 ARE QUOTED DIRECTLY FROM THE SOURCE. DON'T REMOVE ANY OR ADD "NEW" ONES!-->
# It must be "simple, object-oriented, and familiar".
# It must be "robust and secure".
# It must be "architecture-neutral and portable".
# It must execute with "high performance".
# It must be "interpreted, threaded, and dynamic".

{{Java platforms}}

Sun has defined and supports four editions of Java targeting different application environments and segmented many of its [[application programming interface|APIs]] so that they belong to one of the platforms. The platforms are:

The [[Class (computer programming)|classes]] in the Java APIs are organized into separate groups called [[Java package|packages]]. Each package contains a set of related [[Interface (Java)|interfaces]], classes, and [[exception handling|exceptions]]. Refer to the separate platforms for a description of the packages available. {{off topic paragraph}}

Sun also provided an edition called [[PersonalJava]] that has been superseded by later, standards-based Java ME configuration-profile pairings.

==Execution System==

===Java JVM and Bytecode===
{{Main|Java (software platform)|Java virtual machine}}
<!-- we apparently have two main sections for what seems to be the same thing. Merge needed? -->

One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate runtime support.
This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called [[Java bytecode]], instead of directly to architecture-specific [[machine code]]. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a [[virtual machine]] (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. [[End user]]s commonly use a [[Java virtual machine|Java Runtime Environment]] (JRE) installed on their own machine for standalone Java applications, or in a web browser for Java [[applet]]s.

Standard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, [[thread (computing)|threading]], and [[Computer network|networking]].

The use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native [[executable]]s. [[Just-in-time compilation|Just-in-time]] (JIT) compilers that compile bytecodes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular platform it is to run on by a [[Java virtual machine]] for it, which translates the [[Java bytecode]] into the platform's machine language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/java-questions/jvm-platform-dependent/|title=Is the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) platform dependent or platform independent? What is the advantage of using the JVM, and having Java be a translated language?|publisher=Programmer Interview|accessdate=2015-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119144223/http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/java-questions/jvm-platform-dependent/|archive-date=January 19, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====Performance====
{{Main|Java performance}}

Programs written in Java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in C++.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jelovic.com/articles/why_java_is_slow.htm |title=Why Java will always be slower than C++ |last=Jelovic |first=Dejan |accessdate=2008-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211111923/http://www.jelovic.com/articles/why_java_is_slow.htm |archivedate=February 11, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://days2011.scala-lang.org/sites/days2011/files/ws3-1-Hundt.pdf |title=Loop Recognition in C++/Java/Go/Scala |last=Google| accessdate=2012-07-12 }}</ref> However, Java programs' execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of [[just-in-time compilation]] in 1997/1998 for [[Java version history|Java 1.1]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.symantec.com/about/news/release/article.jsp?prid=19970407_03 |title=Symantec's Just-In-Time Java Compiler To Be Integrated into Sun JDK 1.1 |access-date=August 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628171748/http://www.symantec.com/about/news/release/article.jsp?prid=19970407_03 |archive-date=June 28, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}</ref> the addition of language features supporting better code analysis (such as inner classes, the StringBuilder class, optional assertions, etc.), and optimizations in the Java virtual machine, such as [[HotSpot]] becoming the default for Sun's JVM in 2000. With Java 1.5, the performance was improved with the addition of the java.util.concurrent package, including [[lock free]] implementations of the [[Java ConcurrentMap|ConcurrentMaps]] and other multi-core collections, and it was improved further with Java 1.6.

===Non-JVM===
Some platforms offer direct hardware support for Java; there are microcontrollers that can run Java bytecode in hardware instead of a software Java virtual machine,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Salcic|first=Zoran|last2=Park|first2=Heejong|last3=Teich|first3=Jürgen|last4=Malik|first4=Avinash|last5=Nadeem|first5=Muhammad|date=2017-07-22|title=Noc-HMP: A Heterogeneous Multicore Processor for Embedded Systems Designed in SystemJ|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3097980.3073416|journal=ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES)|volume=22|issue=4|pages=73|doi=10.1145/3073416|issn=1084-4309}}</ref> and some [[ARM architecture|ARM]] based processors could have hardware support for executing Java bytecode through their [[Jazelle]] option, though support has mostly been dropped in current implementations of ARM.

===Automatic memory management===
Java uses an [[Garbage collection (computer science)|automatic garbage collector]] to manage memory in the [[object lifetime|object lifecycle]]. The programmer determines when objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use. Once no references to an object remain, the [[unreachable memory]] becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector. Something similar to a [[memory leak]] may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use. If methods for a nonexistent object are called, a "null pointer exception" is thrown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html |title=NullPointerException |publisher=Oracle |accessdate=2014-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506214735/http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html |archive-date=May 6, 2014 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artima.com/designtechniques/exceptions.html |title=Exceptions in Java |publisher=Artima.com |accessdate=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121152332/http://www.artima.com/designtechniques/exceptions.html |archive-date=January 21, 2009 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

One of the ideas behind Java's automatic memory management model is that programmers can be spared the burden of having to perform manual memory management. In some languages, memory for the creation of objects is implicitly allocated on the [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]] or explicitly allocated and deallocated from the [[Memory management#DYNAMIC|heap]]. In the latter case, the responsibility of managing memory resides with the programmer. If the program does not deallocate an object, a [[memory leak]] occurs. If the program attempts to access or deallocate memory that has already been deallocated, the result is undefined and difficult to predict, and the program is likely to become unstable or crash. This can be partially remedied by the use of [[smart pointer]]s, but these add overhead and complexity. Note that garbage collection does not prevent "logical" memory leaks, ''i.e.'', those where the memory is still referenced but never used.

Garbage collection may happen at any time. Ideally, it will occur when a program is idle. It is guaranteed to be triggered if there is insufficient free memory on the heap to allocate a new object; this can cause a program to stall momentarily. Explicit memory management is not possible in Java.

Java does not support C/C++ style [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer arithmetic]], where object addresses and unsigned integers (usually long integers) can be used interchangeably. This allows the garbage collector to relocate referenced objects and ensures type safety and security.

As in C++ and some other object-oriented languages, variables of Java's [[primitive data type]]s are either stored directly in fields (for objects) or on the [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack]] (for methods) rather than on the heap, as is commonly true for non-primitive data types (but see [[escape analysis]]). This was a conscious decision by Java's designers for performance reasons.

Java contains multiple types of garbage collectors. By default, HotSpot uses the [[parallel scavenge garbage collector]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/performance-enhancements-7.html |title=Java HotSpot™ Virtual Machine Performance Enhancements |publisher=Oracle.com |accessdate=2017-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170529071720/http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/performance-enhancements-7.html |archive-date=May 29, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}</ref> However, there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used to manage the heap. For 90% of applications in Java, the [[Concurrent mark sweep collector|Concurrent Mark-Sweep]] (CMS) garbage collector is sufficient.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/vmoptions-jsp-140102.html |title=Java HotSpot VM Options |publisher=Oracle.com |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2012-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306144553/http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/vmoptions-jsp-140102.html |archive-date=March 6, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Oracle aims to replace CMS with the [[Garbage-First collector]] (G1).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/G1.html|title=Garbage-First Collector|website=docs.oracle.com|access-date=March 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309234342/http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/G1.html|archive-date=March 9, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Syntax==
{{Main|Java syntax}}
[[File:JavaUniverse.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Dependency graph of the Java Core classes (created with jdeps and [[Gephi]]). The most frequently used classes Object and String appear in the centre of the diagram.]]

The syntax of Java is largely influenced by [[C++]]. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language.<ref name="design_goals"/> All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, (''i.e.'' integers, floating-point numbers, [[Boolean data type|boolean values]], and characters), which are not objects for performance reasons. Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the {{java|printf}} method).

Unlike C++, Java does not support [[operator overloading]]<ref name="msdn_operator_overloading">{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228498%28v=vs.90%29.aspx | title=Operator Overloading (C# vs Java) | publisher=Microsoft | work=C# for Java Developers | accessdate=December 10, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107190007/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228498(v=vs.90).aspx | archive-date=January 7, 2015 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}</ref> or [[multiple inheritance]] for ''classes'', though multiple inheritance is supported for [[interface (Java)|interface]]s.<ref name="oracle_multiple_inheritance">{{cite web | url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/multipleinheritance.html | title=Multiple Inheritance of State, Implementation, and Type | publisher=Oracle | work=The Java™ Tutorials | accessdate=December 10, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109034520/https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/multipleinheritance.html | archive-date=November 9, 2014 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Java uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (<code>//</code>), a multiple line style opened with <code>/*</code> and closed with <code>*/</code>, and the [[Javadoc]] commenting style opened with <code>/**</code> and closed with <code>*/</code>. The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to create documentation for the program and can be read by some [[integrated development environment]]s (IDEs) such as [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] to allow developers to access documentation within the IDE.

=== "Hello world" example ===
The traditional [["Hello, world!" program]] can be written in Java as:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/application/index.html |title=Lesson: A Closer Look at the "Hello World!" Application |work=The Java™ Tutorials > Getting Started |publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]] |accessdate=2011-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317072804/http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/application/index.html |archive-date=March 17, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
<!--
NOTE:
PLEASE *don't* change the example code; it's written in Sun's recommended style. That includes the brace style.
 -->
<source lang="java">
class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Prints the string to the console.
    }
}
</source>

Source files must be named after the public class they contain, appending the suffix <code>.java</code>, for example, <code>HelloWorldApp.java</code>. It must first be compiled into bytecode, using a [[Java compiler]], producing a file named <code>HelloWorldApp.class</code>. Only then can it be executed, or "launched". The Java source file may only contain one public class, but it can contain multiple classes with other than public access modifier and any number of public [[inner class]]es. When the source file contains multiple classes, make one class "public" and name the source file with that public class name.

A <code>'''class'''</code> that is not declared <code>'''public'''</code> may be stored in any .java file. The compiler will generate a class file for each class defined in the source file. The name of the class file is the name of the class, with ''.class'' appended. For class file generation, [[Class (computer programming)#Unnamed|anonymous classes]] are treated as if their name were the concatenation of the name of their enclosing class, a ''$'', and an integer.

The [[List of Java keywords|keyword]] <code>'''public'''</code> denotes that a method can be called from code in other classes, or that a class may be used by classes outside the class hierarchy. The class hierarchy is related to the name of the directory in which the .java file is located. This is called an access level modifier. Other access level modifiers include the keywords <code>'''private'''</code> and <code>'''protected'''</code>.

The keyword <code>'''static'''</code> in front of a method indicates a [[Method (computer programming)#Static methods|static method]], which is associated only with the class and not with any specific instance of that class. Only static methods can be invoked without a reference to an object. Static methods cannot access any class members that are not also static. Methods that are not designated static are instance methods and require a specific instance of a class to operate.

The keyword <code>'''void'''</code> indicates that the main method does not return any value to the caller. If a Java program is to exit with an error code, it must call System.exit() explicitly.

The method name "<code>main</code>" is not a keyword in the Java language. It is simply the name of the method the Java launcher calls to pass control to the program. Java classes that run in managed environments such as applets and [[Enterprise JavaBeans]] do not use or need a <code>main()</code> method. A Java program may contain multiple classes that have <code>main</code> methods, which means that the VM needs to be explicitly told which class to launch from.

The main method must accept an [[array data type|array]] of '''{{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|String}}''' objects. By convention, it is referenced as <code>'''args'''</code> although any other legal identifier name can be used. Since Java 5, the main method can also use [[variadic function|variable arguments]], in the form of <code>public static void main(String... args)</code>, allowing the main method to be invoked with an arbitrary number of <code>String</code> arguments. The effect of this alternate declaration is semantically identical (to the <code>args</code> parameter which is still an array of <code>String</code> objects), but it allows an alternative syntax for creating and passing the array.

The Java launcher launches Java by loading a given class (specified on the command line or as an attribute in a [[JAR (file format)|JAR]]) and starting its <code>public static void main(String[])</code> method. Stand-alone programs must declare this method explicitly. The <code>String[] args</code> parameter is an [[array data type|array]] of {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|String}} objects containing any arguments passed to the class. The parameters to <code>main</code> are often passed by means of a [[command-line interface|command line]].

Printing is part of a Java standard library: The '''{{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|System}}''' class defines a public static field called '''{{Javadoc:SE|name=out|java/lang|System|out}}'''. The <code>out</code> object is an instance of the {{Javadoc:SE|java/io|PrintStream}} class and provides many methods for printing data to [[standard streams|standard out]], including '''{{Javadoc:SE|name=println(String)|java/io|PrintStream|println(java.lang.String)}}''' which also appends a new line to the passed string.

The string "Hello World!" is automatically converted to a String object by the compiler.

            return memoized.get(fibIndex);
        } else {
            int answer = fibonacci(fibIndex - 1) + fibonacci(fibIndex - 2);
            memoized.put(fibIndex, answer);
            return answer;
        }
    }
}

==Special classes==
===Applet===
{{Main|Java applet}}

Java applets were programs that were [[Embedded system#Embedded software architectures|embedded]] in other applications, typically in a Web page displayed in a web browser.  The Java applet API is now deprecated since Java 9 in 2017.

===Servlet===
{{Main Article| Java servlet}}

[[Java servlet]] technology provides Web developers with a simple, consistent mechanism for extending the functionality of a Web server and for accessing existing business systems. Servlets are [[server-side]] Java EE components that generate responses (typically [[HTML]] pages) to requests (typically [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] requests) from [[client (computing)|clients]].

The Java servlet API has to some extent been superseded by two standard Java technologies for web services:

* the [[Java API for RESTful Web Services]] (JAX-RS 2.0) useful for AJAX, JSON and REST services, and
* the [[Java API for XML Web Services]] (JAX-WS) useful for  [[SOAP]] [[Web Service]]s.

===JavaServer Pages===
{{Main|JavaServer Pages}}

JavaServer Pages (JSP) are [[server-side]] Java EE components that generate responses, typically [[HTML]] pages, to [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] requests from [[client (computing)|clients]]. JSPs embed Java code in an HTML page by using the special [[delimiter]]s <code><%</code> and <code>%></code>. A JSP is compiled to a Java ''servlet'', a Java application in its own right, the first time it is accessed. After that, the generated servlet creates the response.

===Swing application===
{{Main|Swing (Java)}}

[[Swing (Java)|Swing]] is a graphical user interface [[library (computing)|library]] for the Java SE platform. It is possible to specify a different look and feel through the [[pluggable look and feel]] system of Swing. Clones of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[GTK+]], and [[Motif (software)|Motif]] are supplied by Sun. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] also provides an [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]] look and feel for [[macOS]]. Where prior implementations of these looks and feels may have been considered lacking, Swing in Java SE 6 addresses this problem by using more native [[Graphical control element|GUI widget]] drawing routines of the underlying platforms.

===Generics===
{{Main|Generics in Java}}

In 2004, [[generic programming|generics]] were added to the Java language, as part of J2SE 5.0. Prior to the introduction of generics, each variable declaration had to be of a specific type. For container classes, for example, this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects. Either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface, usually <code>Object</code>, or a different container class has to be created for each contained class. Generics allow compile-time type checking without having to create many container classes, each containing almost identical code. In addition to enabling more efficient code, certain runtime exceptions are prevented from occurring, by issuing compile-time errors. If Java prevented all runtime type errors (<code>ClassCastException</code>'s) from occurring, it would be [[type safety|type safe]].

In 2016, the type system of Java was proven [[soundness|unsound]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namin/unsound/master/doc/unsound-oopsla16.pdf|title=Java and Scala's Type Systems are Unsound|access-date=February 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128174902/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namin/unsound/master/doc/unsound-oopsla16.pdf|archive-date=November 28, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Class libraries==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
{{Main|Java Class Library}}

The [[Java Class Library]] is the [[standard library]], developed to support application development in Java. It is controlled by [[Sun Microsystems]] in cooperation with others through the [[Java Community Process]] program. Companies or individuals participating in this process can influence the design and development of the APIs. This process has been a subject of controversy.{{when|date=December 2014}} The class library contains features such as:

* The core libraries, which include:
** IO/NIO

==Documentation==
{{Main|Javadoc}}

Javadoc is a comprehensive documentation system, created by [[Sun Microsystems]], used by many Java developers{{by whom|date=September 2015}}. It provides developers with an organized system for documenting their code. Javadoc comments have an extra asterisk at the beginning, i.e. the delimiters are <code>/**</code> and <code>*/</code>, whereas the normal multi-line comments in Java are set off with the delimiters <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.<ref name="javadoc_comments">{{cite web | url=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/index-137868.html | title=How to Write Doc Comments for the Javadoc Tool | publisher=Oracle | work=Oracle Technology Network | accessdate=December 18, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218182906/http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/index-137868.html | archive-date=December 18, 2014 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Implementations==
{{See also|Free Java implementations}}

[[Oracle Corporation]] is the current owner of the official implementation of the Java SE platform, following their acquisition of [[Sun Microsystems]] on January 27, 2010. This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun. The Oracle implementation is available for [[Microsoft Windows]] (still works for XP, while only later versions are currently officially supported), [[macOS]], [[Linux]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]. Because Java lacks any formal standardization recognized by [[Ecma International]], ISO/IEC, ANSI, or other third-party standards organization, the Oracle implementation is the [[de facto standard]].

The Oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which contains the parts of the Java SE platform required to run Java programs and is intended for end users, and the [[Java Development Kit]] (JDK), which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the [[Java compiler]], [[Javadoc]], [[JAR (file format)|Jar]], and a [[debugger]].

[[OpenJDK]] is another notable Java SE implementation that is licensed under the GNU GPL. The implementation started when Sun began releasing the Java source code under the GPL. As of Java SE 7, OpenJDK is the official Java reference implementation.

The goal of Java is to make all implementations of Java compatible. Historically, Sun's trademark license for usage of the Java brand insists that all implementations be "compatible". This resulted in a legal dispute with [[Microsoft]] after Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support [[Java remote method invocation|RMI]] or [[Java Native Interface|JNI]] and had added platform-specific features of their own. Sun sued in 1997, and, in 2001, won a settlement of US$20&nbsp;million, as well as a court order enforcing the terms of the license from Sun.<ref>{{cite news |author=Niccolai, James |title=Sun, Microsoft settle Java lawsuit |url=http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-01-2001/jw-0124-iw-mssuncourt.html |work=JavaWorld |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=January 23, 2001 |accessdate=2008-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528233154/http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-01-2001/jw-0124-iw-mssuncourt.html |archive-date=May 28, 2008 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As a result, Microsoft no longer ships Java with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

Platform-independent Java is essential to [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]], and an even more rigorous validation is required to certify an implementation. This environment enables portable server-side applications.

==Use outside the Java platform==
The Java programming language requires the presence of a software platform in order for compiled programs to be executed.

Oracle supplies the [[Java platform]] for use with Java. The [[Android SDK]] is an alternative software platform, used primarily for developing [[Android application]]s with its own GUI system. The [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] IDE platform supports Java, but provides its own GUI system [[Standard Widget Toolkit|SWT.]]

===Android===
[[File:Android 6.0-en.png|thumb|upright|The [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system makes extensive use of Java-related technology.]]

The Java language is a key pillar in [[Android (operating system)|Android]], an [[open source software|open source]] [[mobile operating system]]. Although Android, built on the [[Linux kernel]], is written largely in C, the [[Android software development#SDK|Android SDK]] uses the Java language as the basis for Android applications. The bytecode language supported by the Android SDK is incompatible with Java bytecode and runs on its own virtual machine, optimized for low-memory devices such as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s.
Depending on the Android version, the bytecode is either interpreted by the [[Dalvik virtual machine]] or compiled into native code by the [[Android Runtime]].

Android does not provide the full Java SE standard library, although the Android SDK does include an independent implementation of a large subset of it. It supports Java 6 and some Java 7 features, offering an implementation compatible with the standard library ([[Apache Harmony]]).
