macOS is the second major series of [[Macintosh operating systems]]. The first is colloquially called the [[Classic Mac OS|"classic" Mac OS]], which was introduced in 1984, and the final release of which was [[Mac OS 9]] in 1999. The first desktop version, [[Mac OS X 10.0]], was released in March 2001, with its first update, 10.1, arriving later that year. After this, Apple began naming its releases after [[big cat]]s, which lasted until [[OS X Mountain Lion|OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion]]. Since [[OS X Mavericks|OS X 10.9 Mavericks]], releases have been named after locations in [[California]].<ref name="techMavericks">{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/10/os-x-mavericks/ | title=Apple Has A New, California-Based Naming Scheme For OS X, Starting With OS X Mavericks | publisher=TechCrunch | date=June 10, 2013 | accessdate=June 10, 2013 | author=Ha, Anthony | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709214256/https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/10/os-x-mavericks/ | archivedate=July 9, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Apple shortened the name to "OS X" in 2012 and then changed it to "macOS" in 2016, adopting the [[nomenclature]] that they were using for their other operating systems, [[iOS]], [[watchOS]], and [[tvOS]]. The latest version is [[macOS Mojave]], which was publicly released in September 2018.

Between 1999 and 2009, Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called [[MacOS Server|Mac OS X Server]]. The initial version, [[Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X Server 1.0]], was released in 1999 with a user interface similar to [[Mac OS 8.5]].  After this, new versions were introduced concurrently with the desktop version of {{nowrap|Mac OS X}}. Beginning with [[Mac OS X Lion|Mac OS X 10.7 Lion]], the server functions were made available as a separate package on the [[Mac App Store]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-server/id883878097?l=en&mt=12&at=1l3v6qd&ct=wiki|title=macOS Server|website=Mac App Store|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>

macOS is based on technologies developed between 1985 and 1997 at [[NeXT]], a company that Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] created after leaving the company. The "X" in Mac OS X and OS X is the [[Roman numerals#Symbols|Roman numeral]] for the number 10 and is pronounced as such. The X was a prominent part of the operating system's [[Brand#Brand identity|brand identity]] and marketing in its early years, but gradually receded in prominence since the release of Snow Leopard in 2009.

Releases of Mac OS X from 1999 to 2005 can run only on the [[PowerPC]]-based Macs from that time period. After Apple [[Apple's transition to Intel processors|announced that they were switching to Intel CPUs]] from 2006 onwards, a separate version of [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger]] was made and distributed exclusively with early Intel-based Macs; it included an emulator known as [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]], which allowed users to run most PowerPC applications on Intel-based Macs. [[Mac OS X Leopard|Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard]] was the sole release to be built as a [[universal binary]], meaning that the installer disc supported both Intel and PowerPC processors. [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard]] was the first release to be available exclusively for Intel-based Macs. In 2011, Apple released [[Mac OS X Lion|Mac OS X 10.7 Lion]], which no longer supported 32-bit Intel processors and also did not include Rosetta. All versions of the system released since then run exclusively on [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] Intel CPUs and do not support PowerPC applications.{{OS X topics}}

[[File:Unix timeline.en.svg|thumb|450px|Simplified history of [[Unix-like]] operating systems]]
{{Main|History of macOS}}

The heritage of what would become macOS had originated at [[NeXT]], a company founded by [[Steve Jobs]] following his departure from Apple in 1985. There, the [[Unix-like]] [[NeXTSTEP]] operating system was developed, and then launched in 1989. The [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] of NeXTSTEP is based upon the [[Mach kernel]], which was originally developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], with additional kernel layers and low-level [[user space]] code derived from parts of [[BSD]]. Its [[graphical user interface]] was built on top of an [[object-oriented]] [[GUI toolkit]] using the {{nowrap|[[Objective-C]]}} programming language.

Throughout the early 1990s, Apple had tried to create a "next-generation" OS to succeed its [[classic Mac OS]] through the [[Taligent]], [[Copland (operating system)|Copland]] and [[Gershwin operating system|Gershwin]] projects, but all of them were eventually abandoned.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theapplemuseum.com/index.php?id=44 | title=Apple Facts | accessdate=December 15, 2008 | publisher=The Apple Museum | quote=a joint venture with IBM, called Taligent, but was discontinued soon thereafter | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221134115/http://www.theapplemuseum.com/index.php?id=44 | archivedate=December 21, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> This led Apple to purchase [[NeXT]] in 1996, allowing NeXTSTEP, then called [[OpenStep|OPENSTEP]], to serve as the basis for Apple's next generation operating system.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E1D71331F930A15751C1A960958260 | title=Why Apple Sees Next as a Match Made in Heaven | last=Markoff | first=John | work=[[The New York Times]] | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | date=December 23, 1996 | page=D1 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531063010/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E1D71331F930A15751C1A960958260 | archivedate=May 31, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>
This purchase also led to Steve Jobs returning to Apple as an interim, and then the permanent CEO, shepherding the transformation of the programmer-friendly OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple's primary market of home users and creative professionals. The project was first code named "[[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody]]" and then officially named Mac OS X.<ref>{{cite web |first=Neil |last=Fawcett |title=Rhapsody suffers an identity crisis |url=http://business.highbeam.com/411267/article-1G1-20334085/rhapsody-suffers-identity-crisis |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |date=February 12, 1998 |work=[[Computer Weekly]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502033350/http://business.highbeam.com/411267/article-1G1-20334085/rhapsody-suffers-identity-crisis |archivedate=May 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref name="Rhapsody and Blues">{{cite web|last1=Siracusa|first1=John|title=Rhapsody and Blues|url=https://arstechnica.com/staff/2008/04/rhapsody-and-blues/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=30 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104224017/http://arstechnica.com/staff/2008/04/rhapsody-and-blues/|archivedate=November 4, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Mac OS X===
====Launch of Mac OS X====
Mac OS X was originally presented as the tenth major version of Apple's operating system for [[Macintosh]] computers; current versions of macOS retain the major version number "10". Previous Macintosh operating systems (versions of the [[classic Mac OS]]) were named using [[Arabic numerals]], as with [[Mac OS 8]] and [[Mac OS 9]]. The letter "X" in Mac OS X's name refers to the number 10, a [[Roman numeral]]. It is therefore correctly pronounced "ten" in this context.<ref name="ten_not_x">{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22541|title=What is an operating system (OS)?|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|quote=The current version of Mac OS is Mac OS X (pronounced "Mac O-S ten").|date=July 15, 2004|accessdate=December 20, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226055954/http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22541|archivedate=February 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="ArsTec 2006.03">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2006/03/osx-fiveyears.ars|title=Five years of Mac OS X|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publishing|Condé Nast Digital]]|work=[[Ars Technica]]|first=John|last=Siracusa|quote=Even Steve Jobs still says "ecks" instead of "ten" sometimes.|date=March 24, 2006|accessdate=April 15, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625184020/http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2006/03/osx-fiveyears.ars|archivedate=June 25, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, it is also commonly pronounced like the letter "X".<ref name="BBC OSX name">{{cite av media|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00z8dnj/Click_26_02_2011|title=Click - BBC TV programme|publisher=[[BBC]]|last=Kelly|first=Spencer|at=00:12:45|quote=Of course X ("ex") does mean 10, but anyone who used to poke around on Unix systems will know that in those days anything Unix had an X ("ex") in it, and OS Ten is written OS X ("ex") in honour of the fact that it is based on UNIX, unlike its predecessors.

The first version of Mac OS X, [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]], was a transitional product, featuring an interface resembling the [[classic Mac OS]], though it was not compatible with software designed for the older system. Consumer releases of Mac OS X included more [[backward compatibility]]. Mac OS applications could be rewritten to run natively via the [[Carbon API]]; many could also be run directly through the [[Classic Environment]] with a reduction in performance.

The consumer version of Mac OS X was launched in 2001 with [[Mac OS X 10.0]]. Reviews were variable, with extensive praise for its sophisticated, glossy [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua interface]] but criticizing it for sluggish performance.<ref name="Siracusa decade of Mac OS X reviews">{{cite web|last1=Siracusa|first1=John|title=Here’s to the crazy ones: a decade of Mac OS X reviews|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/05/mac-os-x-revisited/2|website=[[Ars Technica]]|date=May 13, 2011|accessdate=November 30, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208074957/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/05/mac-os-x-revisited/2/|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> With Apple's popularity at a low, the makers of several classic Mac applications such as [[FrameMaker]] and [[PageMaker]] declined to develop new versions of their software for Mac OS X.<ref name="Adobe discontinues FrameMaker for Macintosh">{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=Jim|title=Adobe discontinues FrameMaker for Macintosh|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1030037/framemaker.html|website=[[Macworld]]|date=March 23, 2004|accessdate=30 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208120913/http://www.macworld.com/article/1030037/framemaker.html|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''[[Ars Technica]]'' columnist John Siracusa, who reviewed every major OS X release up to 10.10, described the early releases in retrospect as 'dog-slow, feature poor' and Aqua as 'unbearably slow and a huge resource hog'.<ref name="Siracusa decade of Mac OS X reviews" /><ref name="Lion review Siracusa" /><ref name="Jon Rubinstein sends message to HP staff; Addresses TouchPad reviews">{{cite web|last1=Rubenstein|first1=John|title=Jon Rubinstein sends message to HP staff; Addresses TouchPad reviews|url=http://www.webosnation.com/jon-rubenstein-sends-message-hp-staff-addresses-touchpad-reviews|website=WebOS Nation|date=July 1, 2011|accessdate=November 30, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208123726/http://www.webosnation.com/jon-rubenstein-sends-message-hp-staff-addresses-touchpad-reviews|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

A key development for the system was the announcement and release of the [[iPhone]] from 2007 onwards. While Apple's previous [[iPod classic|iPod]] media players used a [[Embedded operating system|minimal]] operating system, the iPhone used an operating system based on Mac OS X, which would later be called "iPhone OS" and then [[iOS]]. The simultaneous release of two operating systems based on the same frameworks placed tension on Apple, which cited the iPhone as forcing it to delay [[Mac OS X Leopard|Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard]].<ref name="Apple announces Leopard delays due to the iPhone">{{cite web|last1=Chartier|first1=David|title=Apple announces Leopard delays due to the iPhone|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/04/12/apple-announces-leopard-delays-due-to-the-iphone/|website=Engadget|accessdate=30 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208125414/http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/12/apple-announces-leopard-delays-due-to-the-iphone/|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, after Apple opened the iPhone to third-party developers its commercial success drew attention to Mac OS X, with many iPhone software developers showing interest in Mac development.<ref name="WWDC 2009 Wrap-Up">{{cite web|last1=Gruber|first1=John|title=WWDC 2009 Wrap-Up|url=http://daringfireball.net/2009/06/wwdc09_wrapup|website=Daring Fireball|accessdate=30 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208045529/http://daringfireball.net/2009/06/wwdc09_wrapup|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

[[File:The OS X Logo.svg|thumb|200px|OS X logo from 2012–2013]]
In 2012, with the release of [[OS X Mountain Lion|OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion]], the name of the system was shortened from Mac OS X to OS X. That year, Apple removed the head of OS X development, [[Scott Forstall]], and design was changed towards a more minimal direction.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news |author=Charles Arthur, technology editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/30/apple-tim-cook-ruthless-streak |title=Apple's Tim Cook shows ruthless streak in firing maps and retail executives &#124; Technology &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2012-10-30 |accessdate=2012-12-06 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024152617/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/30/apple-tim-cook-ruthless-streak |archivedate=October 24, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Apple's new user interface design, using deep color saturation, text-only buttons and a minimal, 'flat' interface, was debuted with [[iOS 7]] in 2013.

From 2012 onwards, the system has shifted to an annual release schedule similar to that of [[iOS]]. It also steadily cut the cost of updates from Snow Leopard onwards, before removing upgrade fees altogether from 2013 onwards.<ref name="Mountain Lion Gruber Schiller">{{cite web|last1=Gruber|first1=John|title=Mountain Lion|url=https://daringfireball.net/2012/02/mountain_lion|website=Daring Fireball|accessdate=15 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811131321/http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/mountain_lion|archivedate=August 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Some journalists and third-party software developers have suggested that this decision, while allowing more rapid feature release, meant less opportunity to focus on stability, with no version of OS X recommendable for users requiring stability and performance above new features.<ref name="Apple has lost the functional high ground">{{cite web|last1=Arment|first1=Marco|title=Apple has lost the functional high ground|url=http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground|accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> Apple's 2015 update, [[OS X El Capitan|OS X 10.11 El Capitan]], was announced to focus specifically on stability and performance improvements.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/review/mac-software/mac-os-x-el-capitan-mac-review-3613524/|title=Mac OS X El Capitan review: The best (and worst) new features|last=Hattersley|first=Lucy|work=Macworld UK|access-date=2017-05-19|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511161056/http://www.macworld.co.uk/review/mac-software/mac-os-x-el-capitan-mac-review-3613524/|archivedate=May 11, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Architecture==
{{Main|Architecture of macOS}}

At macOS's core is a [[POSIX]] compliant operating system built on top of the [[XNU]] [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]], with standard Unix facilities available from the [[command line interface]]. Apple has released this family of software as a [[free software|free]] and [[open source software|open source]] operating system named [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]. On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]] interface and the [[Finder (software)|Finder]], to complete the [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]]-based operating system which is macOS.<ref name="aqua23">{{cite web | url=http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/12/mac-os-x-lion-to-tone-down-the-aqua/ | title=Mac OS X Lion to tone down the Aqua | publisher=[[AOL]] | work=The Unofficial Apple Weblog | date=April 12, 2011 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | author=Grothaus, Michael | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828084840/http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/12/mac-os-x-lion-to-tone-down-the-aqua | archivedate=August 28, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

With its original introduction as Mac OS X, the system brought a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor, the [[classic Mac OS]]. For example, [[pre-emptive multitasking]] and [[memory protection]] improved the system's ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other.<ref>{{cite web | first=Eric Steven | last=Raymond | title=The Elements of Operating-System Style | url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch03s01.html#id2892085 | accessdate=November 5, 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112005720/http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch03s01.html#id2892085 | archivedate=November 12, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>
Many aspects of macOS's architecture are derived from [[OpenStep|OPENSTEP]], which was designed to be portable, to ease the transition from one platform to another. For example, [[NeXTSTEP]] was ported from the original [[68k]]-based NeXT workstations to [[x86]] and other architectures before NeXT was purchased by Apple,<ref name="nextstep_history" />
and OPENSTEP was later ported to the [[PowerPC]] architecture as part of the [[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody project]].

Prior to macOS High Sierra, and on drives other than [[solid state drives]] (SSDs), the default [[file system]] is [[HFS Plus|HFS+]], which it inherited from the classic Mac OS. Operating system designer [[Linus Torvalds]] has criticized HFS+, saying it is "probably the worst file system ever", whose design is "actively corrupting user data". He criticized the [[case insensitivity]] of file names, a design made worse when Apple extended the file system to support [[Unicode]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itworld.com/article/2868393/linus-torvalds-apples-hfs-is-probably-the-worst-file-system-ever.html|title=Linus Torvalds: Apple's HFS+ is probably the worst file system ever|author=Swapnil Bhartiya|date=January 13, 2015|work=CIO|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525041019/http://www.itworld.com/article/2868393/linus-torvalds-apples-hfs-is-probably-the-worst-file-system-ever.html|archivedate=May 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/+JunioCHamano/posts/1Bpaj3e3Rru|title=CVE-2014-9390 aka "Git on case-insensitive filesystems"I did not give the…|work=google.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107111627/https://plus.google.com/+JunioCHamano/posts/1Bpaj3e3Rru|archivedate=November 7, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Initially, HFS+ was designed for classic Mac OS, which runs on [[big-endian]] [[68K]] and [[PowerPC]] systems.

Apple offered two main [[Application programming interface|APIs]] to develop software natively for macOS: [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] and [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]]. Cocoa was a descendant of APIs inherited from [[OpenStep|OPENSTEP]] with no ancestry from the [[classic Mac OS]], while Carbon was an adaptation of classic Mac OS APIs, allowing Mac software to be minimally rewritten in order to run natively on Mac OS X.<ref name="Rhapsody and Blues" />

The Cocoa API was created as the result of a 1993 collaboration between [[NeXT|NeXT Computer]] and [[Sun Microsystems]]. This heritage is highly visible for Cocoa developers, since the "NS" prefix is ubiquitous in the framework, standing variously for '''N'''eXT'''S'''TEP or '''N'''eXT/[[Sun Microsystems|'''S'''un]]. The official OPENSTEP API, published in September 1994, was the first to split the API between Foundation and ApplicationKit and the first to use the "NS" prefix.<ref name="nextstep_history">{{cite web | url=https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/WhatIsCocoa/WhatIsCocoa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH3-SW12 | title=Cocoa Fundamentals Guide: A Bit of History | accessdate=January 18, 2018 | publisher=[[Apple Developer Connection]] | work=ADC Reference Library}}</ref> Traditionally, Cocoa programs have been mostly written in [[Objective-C]], with Java as an alternative. However, on July 11, 2005, Apple announced that "features added to Cocoa in Mac OS X versions later than 10.4 will not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://developer.apple.com/legacy/mac/library/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LanguageIntegration/LanguageIntegration.html | title=Introduction to Cocoa-Java Integration Guide | accessdate=April 8, 2006 | publisher=[[Apple Developer Connection]] | work=ADC Reference Library | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831202711/http://developer.apple.com/legacy/mac/library/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LanguageIntegration/LanguageIntegration.html | archivedate=August 31, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> macOS also used to support the [[Java Platform]] as a "preferred software package"—in practice this means that applications written in Java fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being [[cross-platform]] compatible, and that graphical user interfaces written in [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] look almost exactly like native Cocoa interfaces. Since 2014, Apple has promoted its new programming language [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] as the preferred language for software development on Apple platforms.

Apple's original plan with macOS was to require all developers to rewrite their software into the Cocoa APIs. This caused much outcry among existing Mac developers, who threatened to abandon the platform rather than invest in a costly rewrite, and the idea was shelved.<ref name="Rhapsody and Blues" /><ref name="Photoshop, Lightroom, and Adobe's 64-bit roadmap" /> To permit a smooth transition from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, the [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] [[Application Programming Interface]] (API) was created.<ref name="Rhapsody and Blues" /> Applications written with Carbon were initially able to run natively on both classic Mac OS and Mac OS X, although this ability was later dropped as Mac OS X developed. Carbon was not included in the first product sold as Mac OS X: the little-used original release of [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]], which also did not include the Aqua interface.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1154036/software-utilities/osxorigins.html|title=Looking back at OS X's origins|work=Macworld|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317091143/http://www.macworld.com/article/1154036/software-utilities/osxorigins.html|archivedate=March 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Apple limited further development of Carbon from the release of Leopard onwards, announcing Carbon applications would not receive the ability to run at [[64-bit computing|64-bit]].<ref name="Photoshop, Lightroom, and Adobe's 64-bit roadmap">{{cite web |last1=Nack |first1=John |title=Photoshop, Lightroom, and Adobe's 64-bit roadmap |url=http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2008/04/photoshop_lightroom_and_adobes_64-bit_road.html |publisher=[[Adobe Systems]] |accessdate=March 30, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414030843/http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2008/04/photoshop_lightroom_and_adobes_64-bit_road.html |archivedate=April 14, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="Rhapsody and Blues" /> A number of macOS applications continued to use Carbon for some time afterwards, especially ones with heritage dating back to the classic Mac OS and for which updates would be difficult, uneconomic or not necessary.

This has been cited as an advantage, by allowing users to install apps with confidence that they should not be able to damage their system, but also as a disadvantage due to blocking the Mac App Store's use for professional applications that require elevated privileges.<ref name="Not on the Mac App Store">{{cite web|last1=Counsell|first1=Dan|title=Not on the Mac App Store|url=http://dancounsell.typed.com/articles/not-on-the-mac-app-store|date=November 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208082109/http://dancounsell.typed.com/articles/not-on-the-mac-app-store|archive-date=December 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Distributing Apps Outside the Mac App Store">{{cite web|title=Distributing Apps Outside the Mac App Store|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/DistributingApplicationsOutside/DistributingApplicationsOutside.html|website=Apple Developer|publisher=Apple|accessdate=1 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208143842/https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/DistributingApplicationsOutside/DistributingApplicationsOutside.html|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Applications without any code signature cannot be run by default except from a computer's administrator account.<ref name="How to open apps from an unidentified developer in OS X Mountain Lion">{{cite web|last1=Kazmucha|first1=Allyson|title=How to open apps from an unidentified developer in OS X Mountain Lion|url=http://www.imore.com/how-open-apps-unidentified-developer-os-x-mountain-lion|website=IMore|accessdate=1 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123203524/http://www.imore.com/how-open-apps-unidentified-developer-os-x-mountain-lion|archivedate=November 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="About Gatekeeper">{{cite web|title=About Gatekeeper|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491|publisher=Apple|accessdate=1 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204142544/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491|archivedate=December 4, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Tools such as [[XPostFacto]] and patches applied to the installation media have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of macOS on systems not officially supported by Apple. This includes a number of pre-G3 Power Macintosh systems that can be made to run up to and including Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, all G3-based Macs which can run up to and including Tiger, and sub-867&nbsp;MHz G4 Macs can run Leopard by removing the restriction from the installation DVD or entering a command in the Mac's [[Open Firmware]] interface to tell the Leopard Installer that it has a clock rate of 867&nbsp;MHz or greater.

On June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs announced in his keynote address at the annual Apple [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] that Apple would be making the transition from PowerPC to [[Intel]] processors over the following two years, and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition. Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors for most of its developmental life. Intel-based Macs would run a new recompiled version of OS X along with [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]], a [[binary translation]] layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines.<ref name="John Siracusa mourns the Power PC">{{cite web|last1=Siracusa|first1=John|title=Picking up the pieces: John Siracusa mourns the Power PC|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2005/06/mac-20050607/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=31 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329184041/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2005/06/mac-20050607/|archivedate=March 29, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The system was included with Mac OS X versions up to version 10.6.8.<ref name="AppleInsider: Mac OS X Lion drops Front Row, Java runtime, Rosetta">{{cite web |url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/26/mac_os_x_lion_drops_front_row_java_runtime_rosetta.html |title=Mac OS X Lion drops Front Row, Java runtime, Rosetta |author=AppleInsider Staff |date=February 26, 2011 |work=[[AppleInsider]] |publisher=AppleInsider, Inc |accessdate=February 27, 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110301003419/http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/26/mac_os_x_lion_drops_front_row_java_runtime_rosetta.html | archivedate=March 1, 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref> Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs. Third party emulation software such as [[Mini vMac]], [[Basilisk II]] and [[SheepShaver]] provided support for some early versions of Mac OS. A new version of Xcode and the underlying command-line compilers supported building [[universal binary|universal binaries]] that would run on either architecture.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2005/06/06Apple-to-Use-Intel-Microprocessors-Beginning-in-2006/ | accessdate=January 2, 2018 | title=Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006 | publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] | date=June 6, 2005 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130185804/https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2005/06/06Apple-to-Use-Intel-Microprocessors-Beginning-in-2006/ | archivedate=January 30, 2018 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

PowerPC-only software is supported with Apple's official emulation software, [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]], though applications eventually had to be rewritten to run properly on the newer versions released for Intel processors. Apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both PowerPC and Intel.<ref>{{cite web | title=Adopting Universal Binaries | accessdate=December 20, 2006 | date=January 2006 | url=https://developer.apple.com/macosx/adoptinguniversalbinaries.html | publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017075217/http://developer.apple.com/macosx/adoptinguniversalbinaries.html | archivedate=October 17, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> There is a performance penalty when PowerPC binaries run on Intel Macs through Rosetta. Moreover, some PowerPC software, such as kernel extensions and System Preferences plugins, are not supported on Intel Macs at all. Some PowerPC applications would not run on macOS at all.

===Aqua user interface===
{{Main|Aqua (user interface)}}
[[File:Macosxpb.png|thumb|250px|The original [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]] user interface as seen in the [[Mac OS X Public Beta]] from 2000]]

One of the major differences between the [[classic Mac OS]] and the current macOS was the addition of [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]], a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. Every window element, text, graphic, or [[widget (computing)|widget]] is drawn on-screen using [[spatial anti-aliasing]] technology.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGPartIII/chapter_11_section_1.html | publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] | accessdate=December 16, 2008 | date=June 9, 2008 | work=Apple Human Interface Guidelines | title=The Aqua Interface |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209044209/http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGPartIII/chapter_11_section_1.html | archivedate=December 9, 2008}}</ref> [[ColorSync]], a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for [[printing]] and [[multimedia]] professionals.<ref name="davidson">{{cite book | title=Learning Cocoa With Objective-C | page=6 | last=Davidson | first=James Duncan | publisher=O'Reilly | year=2002 | isbn=0-596-00301-3}}</ref> Also, [[drop shadow]]s were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets ([[dialog box]]es attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.

The use of soft edges, translucent colors, and pinstripes, similar to the hardware design of the first [[iMac]]s, brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what [[Mac OS 9]] and [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]]'s "[[Platinum (theme)|Platinum]]" appearance had offered. According to Siracusa, the introduction of Aqua and its departure from the then conventional look "hit like a ton of bricks."<ref>{{cite web | last=Siracusa | first=John | url=https://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/mac-os-x-10-5.ars/3 | title=Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard: the Ars Technica review | publisher=[[Condé Nast Publishing|Condé Nast Digital]] | work=[[Ars Technica]] | accessdate=December 16, 2008 | date=October 28, 2007 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216092420/http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/mac-os-x-10-5.ars/3 | archivedate=December 16, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>
[[Bruce Tognazzini]] (who founded the original Apple Human Interface Group) said that the Aqua interface in [[Mac OS X 10.0]] represented a step backwards in usability compared with the original Mac OS interface.<ref>{{cite web | date=February 2000 | first=Bruce | last=Tognazzini | url=http://www.asktog.com/columns/034OSX-FirstLook.html | title=OS X: A First Look | accessdate=November 5, 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927085032/http://www.asktog.com/columns/034OSX-FirstLook.html | archivedate=September 27, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date=February 16, 2004 | first=Matthew Paul | last=Thomas | url=http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2004/02/16/os-x | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014095216/http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2004/02/16/os-x | archivedate=October 14, 2008 |title=My first 48 hours enduring Mac OS X | accessdate=November 5, 2008}}</ref>
Third-party developers started producing [[skin (computing)|skins]] for customizable applications and other operating systems which mimicked the Aqua appearance. To some extent, Apple has used the successful transition to this new design as leverage, at various times threatening [[legal action]] against people who make or distribute software with an interface the company says is derived from its [[copyright]]ed design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple lowers boom on Aqua 'skins' |date=February 2, 2001 |url=http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/newsbursts/0,7407,2681914,00.html?chkpt=p1bn |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011031104835/http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/newsbursts/0%2C7407%2C2681914%2C00.html?chkpt=p1bn |archivedate=October 31, 2001 |accessdate=May 22, 2006 |work=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

Apple has continued to change aspects of the macOS appearance and design, particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar. Since 2012, Apple has sold many of its Mac models with high-resolution [[Retina display]]s, and macOS and its [[Application programming interface|APIs]] have extensive support for resolution-independent development on supporting high-resolution displays.

The [[human interface guidelines]] published by Apple for macOS are followed by many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts.<ref>{{cite book | title=Programming Mac OS X: A Guide for Unix Developers | year=2003 | publisher=Manning | isbn=1-930110-85-5 | last=O'Malley | first=Kevin | page=7}}</ref> In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system [[OpenGL]] composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called [[Quartz Compositor|Quartz Extreme]], a component of [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]]. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) imaging model, making it easy to output PDF to multiple devices.<ref name="davidson" /> As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/ | publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] | accessdate=March 2, 2011 | title=Mac OS X.

===Updating methods===
{{Anchor|Functionality|Software Update}}

macOS can be updated using the Software Update preference pane in [[System Preferences]] or the <code>softwareupdate</code> [[command line]] utility.  Until [[OS X Mountain Lion|OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion]], a separate [[List of macOS components#Software Update|Software Update]] application performed this functionality. In Mountain Lion and later, this was merged into the [[Mac App Store]] application, although the underlying update mechanism remains unchanged and is fundamentally different than the download mechanism used when purchasing an App Store application. In [[macOS Mojave|macOS 10.14 Mojave]], the updating function was moved again to the Software Update preference pane.

:{{note label|g5jaguar||Note 1}}The [[PowerMac G5]] had special Jaguar builds.
:{{note label|tiger64bitcli||Note 2}}Tiger did not support 64-bit GUI applications, only 64-bit CLI applications.
:{{note label|rosetta||Note 3}}32-bit PowerPC applications were supported on Intel processors with [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]].

With the exception of [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]] and the original public beta, OS X versions were named after [[big cat]]s until [[OS X Mavericks|OS X 10.9 Mavericks]], when Apple switched to using [[California]] locations. Prior to its release, [[Mac OS X v10.0|Mac OS X 10.0]] was [[code name]]d "Cheetah" internally at Apple, and [[Mac OS X v10.1|Mac OS X 10.1]] was code named internally as "Puma". After the immense buzz surrounding [[Mac OS X v10.2|Mac OS X 10.2]], codenamed "Jaguar", Apple's product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system. [[Mac OS X Panther|Mac OS X 10.3]] was marketed as "Panther", [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X 10.4]] as "Tiger", [[Mac OS X Leopard|Mac OS X 10.5]] as "Leopard", [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Mac OS X 10.6]] as "Snow Leopard", [[Mac OS X Lion|Mac OS X 10.7]] as "Lion", [[OS X Mountain Lion|OS X 10.8]] as "Mountain Lion", and [[OS X Mavericks|OS X 10.9]] as "Mavericks".

"Panther", "Tiger" and "Leopard" are registered as trademarks of Apple,<ref>{{US trademark|78257226}}</ref><ref>{{US trademark|78269988}}</ref><ref>{{US trademark|78270003}}</ref> but "Cheetah", "Puma" and "Jaguar" have never been registered. Apple has also registered "Lynx" and "Cougar" as trademarks, though these were allowed to lapse.<ref>{{US trademark|78271630}}</ref><ref>{{US trademark|78271639}}</ref> Computer retailer [[Tiger Direct]] sued Apple for its use of the name "Tiger".

===Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard===
{{Main|Mac OS X Snow Leopard}}

Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of {{nowrap|Mac OS X}}, Snow Leopard focused on "under the hood" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive [[Finder (software)|Finder]] rewritten in [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], faster [[Time Machine (Apple software)|Time Machine]] backups, more reliable and user-friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser.  Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1&nbsp;GB of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and dropped default support for applications built for the [[PowerPC]] architecture ([[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]] could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).<ref>{{cite web | first=Steven | last=Lynch | url=http://www.hardocp.com/news/2008/06/11/snow_leopard_will_support_powerpcs | publisher=HardOCP | title=Mac OS X Snow Leopard Drops PowerPC Support | date=June 12, 2008 | accessdate=October 20, 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927054316/http://www.hardocp.com/news/2008/06/11/snow_leopard_will_support_powerpcs | archivedate=September 27, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Snow Leopard also featured new [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] technology capable of supporting greater amounts of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], improved support for multi-core processors through [[Grand Central Dispatch]], and advanced GPU performance with [[OpenCL]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lowendmac.com/2009/the-64-bitness-of-mac-os-x-10-6-snow-leopard/|title=The 64-Bitness of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard|date=2009-08-19|newspaper=Low End Mac|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227090313/http://lowendmac.com/2009/the-64-bitness-of-mac-os-x-10-6-snow-leopard/|archivedate=December 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

{{Main|OS X Mountain Lion}}

OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012.<ref name="PR-25-07" /> Following the release of Lion the previous year, it was the first of the annual rather than two-yearly updates to OS X (and later macOS), which also closely alined with the annual iOS operating system updates. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include [[Game Center]], support for [[iMessage]] in the new [[Messages (Apple)|Messages]] messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from [[iCal]] (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing [[iWork]] documents in [[iCloud]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Apple – OS X Mountain Lion – The world's most advanced desktop operating system.| url=https://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/| date=February 16, 2012| accessdate=February 16, 2012| publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216192032/http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/| archivedate=February 16, 2012| df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Notification Center]], which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher.

[[File:El capitan desktop display.png|thumb|Screenshot of El Capitan]]
OS X 10.11 El Capitan was released on September 30, 2015. Similar to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Apple described this release as containing "refinements to the Mac experience" and "improvements to system performance" rather than new features. Refinements include public transport built into the [[Apple Maps|Maps]] application, GUI improvements to the [[Notes (Apple)|Notes]] application, adopting [[San Francisco (2014 typeface)|San Francisco]] as the system font for clearer legibility, and the introduction of [[System Integrity Protection]]. 

The [[Metal (API)|Metal API]], first introduced in [[iOS 8]], was also included in this operating system for "all Macs since 2012".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://devstreaming.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/6037pi9rxl6tfss8w/603/603_whats_new_in_metal_part_1.pdf|title = What’s New in Metal, Part 1|date = June 2015|accessdate = June 17, 2015|website = [[Apple Developer]]|publisher = Apple|last = Dhiraj|first = Rav|page = 84|format = pdf|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150617222000/http://devstreaming.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/6037pi9rxl6tfss8w/603/603_whats_new_in_metal_part_1.pdf|archivedate = June 17, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> According to Apple, Metal accelerates system-level rendering by up to 50 percent, resulting in faster graphics performance for everyday apps.

===Usage share===
{{See also|Usage share of operating systems}}

As of July 2016, macOS is the second-most-active general-purpose desktop client operating system in use on the [[World Wide Web]] following [[Microsoft Windows]], with a 4.90% usage share according to statistics compiled by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. It is the second most widely used desktop operating system (for web browsing), after Windows, and is estimated at approximately five times the usage of [[Linux]] (which has 1.01%). Usage share generally continues to shift away from the desktop and toward mobile operating systems such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].<ref name="wikimediastats">{{Cite web | url = https://analytics.wikimedia.org/dashboards/browsers/#all-sites-by-os/os-family-and-major-hierarchical-view | title = Wikimedia Traffic Analysis Report - Operating Systems, Jun27-Jul31, 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170503073238/https://analytics.wikimedia.org/dashboards/browsers/#all-sites-by-os/os-family-and-major-hierarchical-view | archivedate = May 3, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

===Promotion===
As a devices company, Apple has mostly promoted macOS to sell Macs, with promotion of macOS updates focused on existing users, promotion at [[Apple Store]] and other retail partners, or through events for developers. In larger scale advertising campaigns, Apple specifically promoted macOS as better for handling media and other home-user applications, and [[Get a Mac#North American campaign|comparing]] Mac OS X (especially versions Tiger and Leopard) with the heavy criticism [[Microsoft]] received for the long-awaited [[Windows Vista]] operating system.<ref name="Apple's Get a Mac campaign">{{cite web|last1=Nudd|first1=Tim|title=Apple's Get a Mac campaign|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/apples-get-mac-complete-campaign-130552|website=AdWeek|accessdate=2 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005151923/http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/apples-get-mac-complete-campaign-130552|archivedate=October 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Apple tweaks Microsoft over Vista ad spending">{{cite web|last1=Arthur|first1=Charles|title=Apple tweaks Microsoft over Vista ad spending|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/oct/23/apple-microsoft-vista-advertising|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208072749/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/oct/23/apple-microsoft-vista-advertising|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
