A main principle of [[open-source software development]] is [[peer production]], with products such as source code, [[blueprint]]s, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code.

''Open source'' gained hold with the rise of the [[Internet]].<ref>{{harvnb|Weber|2004}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref> The [[open-source software movement]] arose to clarify [[copyright]], [[License|licensing]], [[Domain name|domain]], and consumer issues.

Generally, open source refers to a [[computer program]] in which the [[source code]] is available to the general public for use or modification from its original design. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community. Code is released under the terms of a [[software license]]. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.

Many large formal institutions have sprung up to support the development of the open-source movement, including the [[Apache Software Foundation]], which supports community projects such as the open-source framework [[Apache Hadoop]] and the open-source [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] server [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache HTTP]].

==History==
{{main|History of free and open-source software}}The sharing of technical information predates the [[Internet]] and the personal computer considerably. For instance, in the early years of automobile development a group of capital [[monopoly|monopolists]] owned the rights to a [[2 cycle|2-cycle]] gasoline-engine patent originally filed by [[George B. Selden]].<ref name="carculture">{{cite book |author=James J. Flink |title=The Car Culture |publisher=MIT Press |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-262-56015-3 }}</ref> By controlling this patent, they were able to monopolize the industry and force car manufacturers to adhere to their demands, or risk a lawsuit.

In 1911, independent automaker [[Henry Ford]] won a challenge to the Selden patent. The result was that the Selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association (which would eventually become the [[Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association]]) was formed.<ref name="carculture" /> The new association instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all US automotive manufacturers: although each company would develop technology and file patents, these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money among all the manufacturers.<ref name="carculture" /> By the time the US entered [[World War II]], 92 Ford patents and 515 patents from other companies were being shared among these manufacturers, without any exchange of money (or lawsuits).<ref name="carculture" />

Early instances of the free sharing of source code include [[IBM]]'s source releases of its [[operating system]]s and other programs in the 1950s and 1960s, and the [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]] user group that formed to facilitate the exchange of software.<ref name="autogenerated172">{{cite book|title=IBM and the U.S. Data Processing Industry: An Economic History|last=Fisher|first=Franklin M.|publisher=Praeger|year=1983|isbn=978-0-03-063059-0|pages=172–9|author2=James W.

This led to the birth of the early Internet in 1969.

The sharing of source code on the Internet began when the Internet was relatively primitive, with software distributed via [[UUCP]], [[Usenet]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]]. [[BSD]], for example, was first widely distributed by posts to comp.os.linux on the Usenet, which is also where its development was discussed. [[Linux]] followed in this model.

=== Open source as a term ===
The term "open source" was first proposed by a group of people in the [[free software movement]] who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term "free software" and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position.<ref>{{Cite journal| publisher = Stanford University| last = O'Mahony| first = Siobhan Clare| title = The emergence of a new commercial actor: Community managed software projects| location = Stanford, CA| date = 2002|pages=34–42}}</ref> In addition, the ambiguity of the term "free software" was seen as discouraging business adoption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |quote=The problem with it is twofold. First, ... the term "free" is very ambiguous ... Second, the term makes a lot of corporate types nervous.|author=[[Eric S. Raymond]]}}</ref><ref name="infoworld1983">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yy8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA31&dq=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&pg=PA31#v=onepage&q=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&f=false |website=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1983-06-23|title=Free software - Free software is a junkyard of software spare parts |quote=''"In contrast to commercial software is a large and growing body of free software that exists in the public domain.

[...] Since everybody has access to source code, many routines have not only been used but dramatically improved by other programmers."'' |first=Tom |last=Shea |accessdate=2016-02-10}}</ref>
The group included [[Christine Peterson]], [[Todd Anderson]], [[Larry Augustin]], [[Jon Hall (programmer)|Jon Hall]], [[Sam Ockman]], [[Michael Tiemann]] and [[Eric S. Raymond]]. Peterson suggested "open source" at a meeting<ref name=osihistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensource.org/history |title=History of the OSI |date=19 September 2006 |first=Michael |last=Tiemann |authorlink=Michael Tiemann |publisher=[[Open Source Initiative]] |accessdate=23 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001164015/http://www.opensource.org/docs/history.php |archivedate=1 October 2002 |df= }}</ref> held at [[Palo Alto, California]], in reaction to [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]]'s announcement in January 1998 of a source code release for [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]]. [[Linus Torvalds]] gave his support the following day, and Phil Hughes backed the term in ''[[Linux Journal]]''. [[Richard Stallman]], the founder of the free software movement, initially seemed to adopt the term, but later changed his mind.<ref name=osihistory/><ref name="rmsdissent">{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software |publisher=fsf.org |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref> Netscape released its source code under the [[Netscape Public License]] and later under the [[Mozilla Public License]].<ref name="Muffatto000">{{cite book  | title = Open Source: A Multidisciplinary Approach  | first = Moreno  | last = Muffatto  | publisher = Imperial College Press  | year = 2006  | isbn = 978-1-86094-665-3 }}</ref>

Raymond was especially active in the effort to popularize the new term. He made the first public call to the free software community to adopt it in February 1998.<ref name="raymondCall">{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |publisher=Catb.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> Shortly after, he founded The [[Open Source Initiative]] in collaboration with [[Bruce Perens]].<ref name=osihistory/>

The term gained further visibility through an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]]. Originally titled the "Freeware Summit" and later known as the "Open Source Summit",<ref name=opensourcesummit>{{cite web|url=http://linuxgazette.net/issue28/rossum.html |title=Open Source Summit |website=Linux Gazette |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2015-02-07 |first=Guido |last=van Rossum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229053622/http://linuxgazette.net/issue28/rossum.html |archivedate=29 December 2013}}</ref> the event was attended by the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, [[Larry Wall]], [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Eric Allman]], [[Guido van Rossum]], [[Michael Tiemann]], [[Paul Vixie]], [[Jamie Zawinski]], and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, alternatives to the term "free software" were discussed. Tiemann argued for "sourceware" as a new term, while Raymond argued for "open source". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference the same evening.<ref name=opensourcesummit />

"Open source" has never managed to entirely supersede the older term "free software", giving rise to the combined term [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS).

==Economics==
{{main|Open-source economics}}
Some economists agree that open-source is an [[information good]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The economics and management of intellectual property : towards intellectual capitalism|last=Granstrand|first=Ove|publisher=E. Elgar|year=1999|isbn=978-1-85898-967-9|location=Cheltenham, UK}}</ref> or "knowledge good" with original work involving a significant amount of time, money, and effort. The cost of reproducing the work is low enough that additional users may be added at zero or near zero cost{{spaced ndash}}this is referred to as the [[marginal cost]] of a product. [[Copyright]] creates a monopoly so the price charged to consumers can be significantly higher than the marginal cost of production. This allows the author to recoup the cost of making the original work. Copyright thus creates access costs for consumers who value the work more than the marginal cost but less than the initial production cost. Access costs also pose problems for authors who wish to create a [[derivative work]]—such as a copy of a software program modified to fix a bug or add a feature, or a [[remix]] of a song—but are unable or unwilling to pay the copyright holder for the right to do so.

Being organized as effectively a "[[consumers' cooperative]]", open source eliminates some of the access costs of consumers and creators of derivative works by reducing the restrictions of copyright. Basic economic theory predicts that lower costs would lead to higher consumption and also more frequent creation of derivative works.  Organizations such as [[Creative Commons]] host websites where individuals can file for alternative "licenses", or levels of restriction, for their works.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/ |title=About The Licenses |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>
These self-made protections free the general society of the costs of policing copyright infringement.

Others argue that since consumers do not pay for their copies, creators are unable to recoup the initial cost of production and thus have little economic incentive to create in the first place. By this argument, consumers would lose out because some of the goods they would otherwise purchase would not be available. In practice, content producers can choose whether to adopt a proprietary license and charge for copies, or an open license. Some goods which require large amounts of professional research and development, such as the [[pharmaceutical industry]] (which depends largely on [[patent]]s, not copyright for intellectual property protection) are almost exclusively proprietary, although increasingly sophisticated technologies are being developed on open-source principles.<ref>J.M. Pearce, ''[[Open-Source Lab (book)|Open-Source Lab]]: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs'', Elsevier, 2014</ref>

There is evidence that open-source development creates enormous value.<ref>[http://3dprintingindustry.com/2015/02/02/3d-printed-open-hardware-syringe-pump-value-800m/ 3D Printed Open Hardware Syringe Yields $800M Value, Study Finds]- ''3D Printing Industry'' 2-2-2015</ref> For example, in the context of [[open-source hardware]] design, digital designs are shared for free and anyone with access to digital manufacturing technologies (e.g. [[RepRap]] 3D printers) can replicate the product for the cost of materials.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wittbrodt | first1 = B.T. | last2 = Glover | first2 = A.G. | last3 = Laureto | first3 = J. | last4 = Anzalone | first4 = G.C. | last5 = Oppliger | first5 = D. | last6 = Irwin | first6 = J.L. | last7 = Pearce | first7 = J.M. | year = 2013 | title = Life-cycle economic analysis of distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printers | url = | journal = Mechatronics | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 713–726 | doi = 10.1016/j.mechatronics.2013.06.002 }}</ref> The original sharer may receive feedback and potentially improvements on the original design from the [[peer production]] community.

===Licensing alternatives===

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Smart phones.jpg|thumb|125px|Google Android operating system]] -->
Alternative arrangements have also been shown to result in good creation outside of the proprietary license model. Examples include:{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

*[[File:Wikipedia-logo-en-big.png|thumb|125px|Wikipedia is an example of a global application of the open source model.]]Creation for its own sake – For example, [[Wikipedia]] editors add content for recreation. Artists have a drive to create. Both communities benefit from free starting material.
* Voluntary after-the-fact donations – used by [[shareware]], [[street performer]]s, and [[public broadcasting]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Patron – For example, [[open access]] publishing relies on institutional and government funding of research faculty, who also have a professional incentive to publish for reputation and career advancement. Works of the U.S. federal government are automatically released into the [[public domain]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* [[Freemium]] – Give away a limited version for free and charge for a premium version (potentially using a [[dual license]]).
* Give away the product and charge something related – Charge for support of open-source [[enterprise software]], give away music but charge for concert admission.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Give away work in order to gain market share – Used by artists, in corporate software to spoil a dominant competitor (for example in the [[browser wars]] and the [[Android operating system]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* For own use – Businesses or individual software developers often create software to solve a problem, bearing the full cost of initial creation. They will then open source the solution, and benefit from the improvements others make for their own needs. Communalizing the maintenance burden distributes the cost across more users; [[free rider problem|free riders]] can also benefit without undermining the creation process.

==Open-source applications==
[[File:121212 2 OpenSwissKnife.png|thumb|Open-source model application domains]]
Social and political views have been affected by the growth of the concept of open source. Advocates in one field often support the expansion of open source in other fields. But [[Eric Raymond]] and other founders of the [[open-source movement]] have sometimes publicly argued against speculation about applications outside software, saying that strong arguments for software openness should not be weakened by overreaching into areas where the story may be less compelling. The broader impact of the open-source movement, and the extent of its role in the development of new information sharing procedures, remain to be seen.

The [[open-source movement]] has inspired increased [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and liberty in [[biotechnology]] research, for example by [http://Therapoid.net/ open therapeutics] and [[CAMBIA]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/cambia/470.html |title='Open-Source Practices for Biotechnology' — Cambia — Enabling Innovation |publisher=Cambia |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> Even the research methodologies themselves can benefit from the application of open-source principles.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Joshua M.|title=Open Source Research in Sustainability|journal=Sustainability: The Journal of Record|date=1 August 2012|volume=5|issue=4|pages=238–243|doi=10.1089/sus.2012.9944}}</ref> It has also given rise to the rapidly-expanding [[open-source hardware]] movement.

==Society and culture==
{{disputed section|date=December 2016}}
The rise of open-source culture in the 20th century resulted from a growing tension between creative practices that involve require access to content that is often [[copyright]]ed, and restrictive intellectual property laws and policies governing access to copyrighted content. The two main ways in which intellectual property laws became more restrictive in the 20th century were extensions to the term of copyright (particularly in the [[United States]]) and penalties, such as those articulated in the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), placed on attempts to circumvent anti-piracy technologies.<ref name="copyright1998">{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf |title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 |format=PDF |date = December 1998|author = US Copyright Office |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>

Although artistic appropriation is often permitted under [[fair use|fair-use]] doctrines, the complexity and ambiguity of these doctrines creates an atmosphere of uncertainty among cultural practitioners. Also, the protective actions of copyright owners create what some call a "[[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]]" among cultural practitioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/ |title=Chilling Effects Clearinghouse |publisher=Chillingeffects.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>

The idea of an "open-source" culture runs parallel to "[[Free Culture movement|Free Culture]]," but is substantively different. ''Free culture'' is a term derived from the [[free software movement]], and in contrast to that vision of culture, proponents of open-source culture (OSC) maintain that some intellectual property law needs to exist to protect cultural producers. Yet they propose a more nuanced position than corporations have traditionally sought. Instead of seeing intellectual property law as an expression of instrumental rules intended to uphold either natural rights or desirable outcomes, an argument for OSC takes into account diverse goods (as in "the Good life") and ends.

Sites such as [[ccMixter]] offer up free web space for anyone willing to license their work under a [[Creative Commons]] license. The resulting cultural product is then available to download free (generally accessible) to anyone with an Internet connection.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Open source software development – Just another case of collective invention?|url=http://ccmixter.org/about|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fccmixter.org%2Fabout&date=2011-12-22|archivedate=2011-12-22}}</ref> Older analog technologies such as the [[telephone]] or [[television]] have limitations on the kind of interaction users can have.

Through various technologies such as [[peer-to-peer]] networks and [[blogs]], cultural producers can take advantage of vast [[social networks]] to distribute their products. As opposed to traditional media distribution, redistributing digital media on the Internet can be virtually costless. Technologies such as [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] and [[Gnutella]] take advantage of various characteristics of the Internet protocol ([[TCP/IP]]) in an attempt to totally decentralize file distribution.

{{further|Open-source software movement}}

===Government===
* [[Open politics]] (sometimes known as ''Open-source politics'') is a political process that uses Internet technologies such as blogs, email and polling to provide for a rapid feedback mechanism between political organizations and their supporters. There is also an alternative conception of the term ''Open-source politics'' which relates to the development of public policy under a set of rules and processes similar to the open-source software movement.
* [[Open-source governance]] is similar to open-source politics, but it applies more to the democratic process and promotes the freedom of information.
* The [[South Korean government]] wants to increase its use of free and open-source software, in order to decrease its dependence on proprietary software solutions. It plans to make open standards a requirement, to allow the government to choose between multiple operating systems and web browsers. Korea's Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning is also preparing ten pilots on using open-source software distributions.<ref>https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/south-korean-government-switch-open-source</ref>

===Ethics===
Open-source ethics is split into two strands:
* Open-source ethics as an ethical school – Charles Ess and David Berry are researching whether ethics can learn anything from an open-source approach. Ess famously even defined the [[Association of Internet Researchers|AoIR]] Research Guidelines as an example of open-source ethics.<ref>[http://flosshub.org/sites/flosshub.org/files/berry2.pdf Berry (2004) Internet Ethics: Privacy, Ethics and Alienation{{spaced ndash}}An Open Source Approach.] (PDF file)</ref>
* Open-source ethics as a professional body of rules – This is based principally on the computer ethics school, studying the questions of ethics and professionalism in the computer industry in general and software development in particular.<ref>{{cite journal |author=El-Emam, K |title=Ethics and Open Source |journal=Empirical Software Engineering |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=2001 |url=http://springerlink.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=hf0bld3qlk0unn8f8x2m&referrer=parent&backto=issue,2,12;journal,14,33;linkingpublicationresults,1:100262,1#ContactOfAuthor1}}</ref>

===Religion===
Irish philosopher Richard Kearney has used the term "open-source Hinduism" to refer to the way historical figures such as Mohandas Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda worked upon this ancient tradition.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Kearney |title=Anatheism: Returning to God After God |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRiTJ_6JFYYC&pg=PR13 |year=2011 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-14789-7 |page=xiii}}</ref>

===Media===
[[Open-source journalism]] formerly referred to the standard journalistic techniques of news gathering and fact checking, reflecting ''[[open-source intelligence]]'', a similar term used in military intelligence circles. Now, ''open-source journalism'' commonly refers to forms of innovative publishing of [[online journalism]], rather than the sourcing of news stories by a professional journalist. In the 25 December 2006 issue of TIME magazine this is referred to as [[user generated content|user created content]] and listed alongside more traditional open-source projects such as [[OpenSolaris]] and [[Linux]].

[[Blog|Weblogs]], or blogs, are another significant platform for open-source culture. Blogs consist of periodic, reverse chronologically ordered posts, using a technology that makes webpages easily updatable with no understanding of design, code, or [[file transfer]] required. While corporations, political campaigns and other formal institutions have begun using these tools to distribute information, many blogs are used by individuals for personal expression, political organizing, and socializing. Some, such as [[LiveJournal]] or [[WordPress]], utilize open-source software that is open to the public and can be modified by users to fit their own tastes. Whether the code is open or not, this format represents a nimble tool for people to borrow and re-present culture; whereas traditional websites made the illegal reproduction of culture difficult to regulate, the mutability of blogs makes "open sourcing" even more uncontrollable since it allows a larger portion of the population to replicate material more quickly in the public sphere.

[[Messageboards]] are another platform for open-source culture. Messageboards (also known as discussion boards or forums), are places online where people with similar interests can congregate and post messages for the community to read and respond to. Messageboards sometimes have moderators who enforce community standards of etiquette such as banning users who are [[spamming|spammers]]. Other common board features are private messages (where users can send messages to one another) as well as chat (a way to have a real time conversation online) and image uploading. Some messageboards use [[phpBB]], which is a free open-source package. Where blogs are more about individual expression and tend to revolve around their authors, messageboards are about creating a conversation amongst its users where information can be shared freely and quickly. Messageboards are a way to remove intermediaries from everyday life—for instance, instead of relying on commercials and other forms of advertising, one can ask other users for frank reviews of a product, movie or CD. By removing the cultural middlemen, messageboards help speed the flow of information and exchange of ideas.

[[OpenDocument]] is an [[open format|open]] [[document file format]] for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents (including memos, reports, and books), [[spreadsheet]]s, charts, and presentations. Organizations and individuals that store their data in an open format such as OpenDocument avoid being [[Vendor lock-in|locked into]] a single software vendor, leaving them free to switch software if their current vendor goes out of business, raises their prices, changes their software, or changes their [[software license|licensing]] terms to something less favorable.

[[Open-source film|Open-source movie production]] is either an open call system in which a changing crew and cast collaborate in movie production, a system in which the end result is made available for re-use by others or in which exclusively open-source products are used in the production. The 2006 movie [[Elephants Dream]] is said to be the "world's first open movie",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantsdream.org/ |title=Elephants Dream |publisher=Elephants Dream |date=2006-08-13 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> created entirely using [[open-source technology]].

An open-source documentary film has a production process allowing the open contributions of archival material [[footage]], and other filmic elements, both in unedited and edited form, similar to crowdsourcing. By doing so, on-line contributors become part of the process of creating the film, helping to influence the editorial and visual material to be used in the documentary, as well as its thematic development. The first open-source documentary film is the non-profit "[[The American Revolution]]", which went into development in 2006, and will examine the role media played in the cultural, social and political changes from 1968 to 1974 through the story of radio station WBCN-FM in Boston.<ref>"Web Power to the People," The Boston Herald, 29 September 2005</ref><ref>"The Glory Days of the Rock of Boston," Boston Globe, Op-Ed, 18 July 2009.</ref><ref>"'BCN Documentary Looks for Archival Contributors," Boston Herald, 11 August 2009</ref><ref>"WBCN and The American Revolution," The Huffington Post, 11 August 2009</ref> The film is being produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media and the non-profit Filmmakers Collaborative. Open Source Cinema is a website to create Basement Tapes, a feature documentary about copyright in the digital age, co-produced by the National Film Board of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca |title=Watch Documentaries and Animated Films Online |publisher=NFB.ca |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>
[[Open-source film|Open-source film-making]] refers to a form of film-making that takes a method of idea formation from open-source software, but in this case the 'source' for a filmmaker is raw unedited footage rather than programming code. It can also refer to a method of film-making where the process of creation is 'open' i.e. a disparate group of contributors, at different times contribute to the final piece.

[[Open-IPTV]] is [[IPTV]] that is not limited to one recording studio, production studio, or cast. Open-IPTV uses the Internet or other means to pool efforts and resources together to create an online community that all contributes to a show.

===Education===
[[File:Global Open Educational Resources Logo.svg|thumb|125px|[[Open Educational Resources]] logo]]
Within the academic community, there is discussion about expanding what could be called the "intellectual commons" (analogous to the [[Creative Commons]]). Proponents of this view have hailed the [[OpenStax CNX|Connexions]] Project at [[Rice University]], [[MIT OpenCourseWare|OpenCourseWare]] project at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Eugene Thacker]]'s article on "open-source DNA", the "Open Source Cultural Database", [[Salman Khan (educator)|Salman Khan]]'s [[Khan Academy]] and [[Wikipedia]] as examples of applying open source outside the realm of computer software.

[[Open-source curriculum|Open-source curricula]] are instructional resources whose digital source can be freely used, distributed and modified.

Another strand to the academic community is in the area of research. Many funded research projects produce software as part of their work. There is an increasing interest in making the outputs of such projects available under an open-source license. In the UK the [[Jisc|Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)]] has developed a policy on open-source software. JISC also funds a development service called [[OSS Watch]] which acts as an advisory service for higher and further education institutions wishing to use, contribute to and develop open-source software.

On 30 March 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which included $2 billion over four years to fund the [[TAACCCT|TAACCCT program]], which is described as "the largest OER (open education resources) initiative in the world and uniquely focused on creating curricula in partnership with industry for credentials in vocational industry sectors like manufacturing, health, energy, transportation, and IT".<ref>http://openeducation2013.sched.org/event/23553161b01967fd7ff58eea22ce24b2#.U_qxw2Mpft8</ref>

===Innovation communities===
The principle of sharing pre-dates the open-source movement; for example, the free sharing of information has been institutionalized in the scientific enterprise since at least the 19th century. Open-source principles have always been part of the scientific community. The sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] described the four basic elements of the community—universal ism (an international perspective), communal ism (sharing information), disinterestedness (removing one's personal views from the scientific inquiry) and organized skepticism (requirements of proof and review) that accurately describe the scientific community today.

These principles are, in part, complemented by US law's focus on protecting expression and method but not the ideas themselves. There is also a tradition of publishing research results to the scientific community instead of keeping all such knowledge proprietary. One of the recent initiatives in scientific publishing has been [[Open access (publishing)|open access]]—the idea that research should be published in such a way that it is free and available to the public. There are currently many open access journals where the information is available free online, however most journals do charge a fee (either to users or libraries for access). The [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] is an international effort with the goal of making all research articles available free on the Internet.

The [[National Institutes of Health]] has recently proposed a policy on "Enhanced Public Access to NIH Research Information". This policy would provide a free, searchable resource of NIH-funded results to the public and with other international repositories six months after its initial publication. The NIH's move is an important one because there is significant amount of public funding in scientific research. Many of the questions have yet to be answered—the balancing of profit vs. public access, and ensuring that desirable standards and incentives do not diminish with a shift to open access.

Farmavita.Net is a community of pharmaceuticals executives that has recently proposed a new business model of open-source pharmaceuticals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.farmavita.net/content/view/336/84/ |title=Pharmaceutical Licensing Network — Open Source Pharmaceuticals — New Business Model |publisher=Farmavita.Net |date=2007-01-12 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref> The project is targeted to development and sharing of know-how for manufacture of essential and life-saving medicines. It is mainly dedicated to the countries with less developed economies where local pharmaceutical research and development resources are insufficient for national needs.
