R is an implementation of the [[S (programming language)|S programming language]] combined with [[lexical scoping]] semantics, inspired by [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Hill|first2=Brandon|last3=Osvald|first3=Leo|last4=Vitek|first4=Jan|year=2012|title=Evaluating the design of the R language: objects and functions for data analysis|url=http://r.cs.purdue.edu/pub/ecoop12.pdf|journal=ECOOP'12 Proceedings of the 26th European conference on Object-Oriented Programming|access-date=2016-05-17|first1=Frances|last1=Morandat}}</ref> [[S (programming language)|S]] was created by [[John Chambers (programmer)|John Chambers]] in 1976, while at [[Bell Laboratories|Bell Labs]].

R was created by [[Ross Ihaka]] and [[Robert Gentleman (statistician)|Robert Gentleman]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myprofile.cos.com/rgentleman|title=Individual Expertise profile of Robert Gentleman|last=Gentleman|first=Robert|date=9 December 2006|accessdate=2009-07-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723215206/http://myprofile.cos.com/rgentleman|archivedate=23 July 2011}}</ref> at the [[University of Auckland]], New Zealand, and currently developed by the ''R Development Core Team'' (of which Chambers is a member).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thieme |first1=Nick |title=R generation |journal=Significance |date=August 2018 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=14–19 |doi=10.1111/j.1740-9713.2018.01169.x}}</ref> R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of [[S (programming language)|S]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Why-is-R-named-R_003f|title=The R FAQ: Why R?|isbn=3-900051-08-9|author=Kurt Hornik|accessdate=2008-01-29}}</ref> The project was conceived in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a stable beta version in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cran.r-project.org/doc/html/interface98-paper/paper_2.html|title=R : Past and Future History -- A Free Software Project|website=cran.r-project.org|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/03/16-years-of-r-history.html|title=Over 16 years of R Project history|website=Revolutions|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/Massey.pdf|title=The R Project: A Brief History and Thoughts About the Future|last=Ihaka|first=Ross|date=|website=stat.auckland.ac.nz|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>

== Statistical features ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:R gui on os x.png|thumb|right|The R [[gui]] running the general linear model demo on Mac OS X.]] -->
R and its libraries implement a wide variety of statistical and [[graphical]] techniques, including [[linear]] and [[nonlinear]] modelling, classical statistical tests, [[time-series analysis]], classification, clustering, and others. R is easily extensible through functions and extensions, and the R community is noted for its active contributions in terms of packages. Many of R's standard functions are written in R itself, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally intensive tasks, [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[Fortran]] code can be [[Linking (computing)|linked]] and called at run time. Advanced users can write C, C++,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i08|title= Rcpp: Seamless R and C++ Integration|first1=Dirk|last1= Eddelbuettel|first2=Romain|last2=Francois|journal=[[Journal of Statistical Software]]|volume=40|issue=8|year=2011|doi=10.18637/jss.v040.i08}}</ref> [[Java (programming language)|Java]],<ref>{{cite web|title=nution-j2r: Java library to invoke R native functions|url=https://gitlab.nuiton.org/nuiton/nuiton-j2r|accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref> [[.NET Framework|.NET]]{{refn | .NET Framework

Due to its [[S (programming language)|S]] heritage, R has stronger [[object-oriented programming]] facilities than most statistical computing languages. Extending R is also eased by its [[lexical scoping]] rules.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Jackman | first = Simon | title = R For the Political Methodologist | journal = The Political Methodologist | volume = 11  | issue = 1 | pages = 20–22 | date = Spring 2003 | publisher = Political Methodology Section, [[American Political Science Association]] | url = http://polmeth.wustl.edu/tpm/tpm_v11_n2.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2018-09-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060721143309/http://polmeth.wustl.edu/tpm/tpm_v11_n2.pdf |archivedate = 2006-07-21}}</ref>

Another strength of R is static graphics, which can produce publication-quality graphs, including mathematical symbols.  Dynamic and interactive graphics are available through additional packages.<ref>{{cite web

R has Rd, its own [[LaTeX]]-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both online in a number of formats and in hard copy.<ref name="R_Rd">{{cite web|title=Rd format|url=http://www.hep.by/gnu/r-patched/r-exts/R-exts_49.html|website=hep.by|accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref>

== Programming features ==
R is an [[interpreted language]]; users typically access it through a [[command-line interpreter]]. If a user types <code>2+2</code> at the R command prompt and presses enter, the computer replies with 4, as shown below:

<source lang="rout">
> 2 + 2
[1] 4
</source>

This calculation is interpreted as the sum of two single-element vectors, resulting in a single-element vector. The prefix <code>[1]</code> indicates that the list of elements following it on the same line starts with the ''first'' element of the vector (a feature that is useful when the output extends over multiple lines).

Like other similar languages such as [[APL (programming language)|APL]] and [[MATLAB]], R supports [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix arithmetic]]. R's [[data structure]]s include [[Column vector|vectors]], [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], arrays, data frames (similar to [[Table (database)|tables]] in a [[relational database]]) and [[List (computing)|lists]].<ref>
{{cite book |last=Dalgaard |first=Peter |title=Introductory Statistics with R |year=2002 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York, Berlin, Heidelberg |isbn=0387954759 | pages=10–18, 34 }}
</ref> R's extensible object system includes objects for (among others): [[Regression analysis|regression models]], [[time-series]] and [[Spatial analysis|geo-spatial coordinates]]. The scalar data type was never a data structure of R.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ihaka |first=Ross |last2=Gentlman |first2=Robert |date=Sep 1996 |title=R: A Language for Data Analysis and Graphics |url=https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/R-paper.pdf |journal=Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics |publisher=American Statistical Association |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=299–314 |doi=10.2307/1390807 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref> Instead, a scalar is represented as a vector with length one.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html|title=Data structures · Advanced R.|website=adv-r.had.co.nz|access-date=2016-09-26}}</ref>

R supports [[procedural programming]] with [[Function (computer science)|functions]] and, for some functions, [[object-oriented programming]] with [[generic function]]s. A generic function acts differently depending on the [[Class (computer programming)|classes]] of arguments passed to it. In other words, the generic function [[Dynamic dispatch|dispatches]] the function ([[Method (computer science)|method]]) specific to that  [[Class (computer programming)|class]]  of [[Object (computer science)|object]]. For example, R has a [[Generic function|generic]] <code>print</code> function that can print almost every [[Class (computer programming)|class]] of [[Object (computer science)|object]] in R with a simple <code>print(objectname)</code> syntax.<ref name="help_print">{{cite web|author=R Core Team|title=Print Values|url=https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/print.html|website=R Documentation|publisher=R Foundation for Statistical Computing|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref>

Although used mainly by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, R can also operate as a [[numerical linear algebra|general matrix calculation]] toolbox – with performance benchmarks comparable to [[GNU Octave]] or [[MATLAB]].<ref>{{cite web

== Implementations ==
The main R implementation is written in R, C, and Fortran, and there are several other implementations aimed at improving speed or increasing extensibility. A closely related implementation is pqR (pretty quick R) by [[Radford M. Neal]] with improved memory management and support for automatic multithreading. [[Renjin]] and FastR are [[Java (programming language)|Java]] implementations of R for use in a Java Virtual Machine.  CXXR, rho, and Riposte<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Talbot|first1=Justin|last2=DeVito|first2=Zachary|last3=Hanrahan|first3=Pat|title=Riposte: A Trace-driven Compiler and Parallel VM for Vector Code in R|journal=Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques|date=1 January 2012|pages=43–52|doi=10.1145/2370816.2370825 |publisher=ACM}}</ref> are implementations of R in [[C++]].  Renjin, Riposte, and pqR attempt to improve performance by using multiple processor cores and some form of deferred evaluation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Neal|first1=Radford|title=Deferred evaluation in Renjin, Riposte, and pqR|url=https://radfordneal.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/deferred-evaluation-in-renjin-riposte-and-pqr/|website=Radford Neal's blog|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=25 July 2013}}</ref> Most of these alternative implementations are experimental and incomplete, with relatively few users, compared to the main implementation maintained by the R Development Core Team.

== R Journal ==
''[[The R Journal]]'' is the [[open access]], [[Academic journal|refereed]] journal of the R project for statistical computing. It features short to medium length articles on the use, and development of R, including packages, programming tips, CRAN news, and foundation news.

== Comparison with SAS, SPSS, and Stata ==
R is comparable to popular commercial statistical packages, such as [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SPSS]], and [[Stata]], but R is available to users at no charge under a [[free software license]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_relative_statpack.pdf|title= Comparison of R to SAS, Stata and SPSS|first=Patrick|last=Burns|date=27 February 2007|accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref>

== Commercial support for R ==
{{anchor|Commercialised versions of R}} <!--used in https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-is-R_002dplus_003f-->
Although R is an open-source project supported by the community developing it, some companies strive to provide commercial support and/or extensions for their customers. This section gives some examples of such companies.

In 2007, Richard Schultz, Martin Schultz, Steve Weston and Kirk Mettler founded [[Revolution Analytics]] to provide commercial support for Revolution R, their distribution of R, which also includes components developed by the company. Major additional components include: ParallelR, the R Productivity Environment IDE, RevoScaleR (for [[big data]] analysis), RevoDeployR, web services framework, and the ability for reading and writing data in the SAS file format.<ref name="prickett">Morgan, Timothy Prickett (2011-02-07).

=== Structure of a function ===
One of R’s strengths is the ease of creating new functions. Objects in the function body remain local to the function, and any data type may be returned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statmethods.net/management/userfunctions.html|title=Quick-R: User-Defined Functions|first=Robert|last=Kabacoff|year=2012|accessdate=2018-09-28|website=statmethods.net}}</ref>
Here is an example user-created function:
<source lang="r">
# Declare function “f” with parameters “x”, “y“
# that returns a linear combination of x and y.
f <- function(x, y) {
  z <- 3 * x + 4 * y
  return(z)
}
</source>
<source lang="rout">
> f(1, 2)
[1] 11

> f(c(1,2,3), c(5,3,4))
[1] 23 18 25

> f(1:3, 4)
[1] 19 22 25
</source>

=== Mandelbrot set ===
Short R code calculating [[Mandelbrot set]] through the first 20 iterations of equation ''z'' = ''z''<sup>2</sup> + ''c'' plotted for different complex constants ''c''.  This example demonstrates:

* use of community-developed external libraries (called packages), in this case caTools package
* handling of [[complex numbers]]
* multidimensional arrays of numbers used as basic data type, see variables <code>C</code>, <code>Z</code> and <code>X</code>.

<source lang="r">
install.packages("caTools")  # install external package
library(caTools)             # external package providing write.gif function
jet.colors <- colorRampPalette(c("red", "blue", "#007FFF", "cyan", "#7FFF7F",
                                 "yellow", "#FF7F00", "red", "#7F0000"))
dx <- 1500                    # define width
dy <- 1400                    # define height
C  <- complex(real = rep(seq(-2.2, 1.0, length.out = dx), each = dy),
              imag = rep(seq(-1.2, 1.2, length.out = dy), dx))
C <- matrix(C, dy, dx)       # reshape as square matrix of complex numbers
Z <- 0                       # initialize Z to zero
X <- array(0, c(dy, dx, 20)) # initialize output 3D array
for (k in 1:20) {            # loop with 20 iterations
  Z <- Z^2 + C               # the central difference equation
  X[, , k] <- exp(-abs(Z))   # capture results
}
write.gif(X, "Mandelbrot.gif", col = jet.colors, delay = 100)
</source>
