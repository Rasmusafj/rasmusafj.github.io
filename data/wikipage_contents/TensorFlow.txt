== History ==
=== DistBelief ===
Starting in 2011, Google Brain built DistBelief as a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[machine learning]] system based on [[deep learning]] [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]]. Its use grew rapidly across diverse [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet]] companies in both research and commercial applications.<ref name=whitepaper2015>{{cite web |last1 = Dean |first1 = Jeff |last2 = Monga |first2 = Rajat |first3 = Sanjay |last3 = Ghemawat |display-authors = 2 |authorlink1 = Jeff Dean (computer scientist) |title = TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems |url = http://download.tensorflow.org/paper/whitepaper2015.pdf |website = TensorFlow.org |publisher = Google Research |accessdate = November 10, 2015 |date = November 9, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=Perez>{{cite web |last1 = Perez |first1 = Sarah |title = Google Open-Sources The Machine Learning Tech Behind Google Photos Search, Smart Reply And More |url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/09/google-open-sources-the-machine-learning-tech-behind-google-photos-search-smart-reply-and-more/ |website = TechCrunch |accessdate = November 11, 2015 |date = November 9, 2015 }}</ref> Google assigned multiple computer scientists, including [[Jeff Dean (computer scientist)|Jeff Dean]], to simplify and [[Code refactoring|refactor]] the codebase of DistBelief into a faster, more robust application-grade library, which became TensorFlow.<ref name=Oremus>{{cite web |last1 = Oremus |first1 = Will |title = What Is TensorFlow, and Why Is Google So Excited About It? |url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/11/09/google_s_tensorflow_is_open_source_and_it_s_about_to_be_a_huge_huge_deal.html |website = Slate |accessdate = November 11, 2015 |date = November 11, 2015 }}</ref> In 2009, the team, led by [[Geoffrey Hinton]], had implemented generalized [[backpropagation]] and other improvements which allowed generation of neural networks with substantially higher accuracy, for instance a 25% reduction in errors in [[speech recognition]].<ref name=Ward-Bailey>{{cite web |last1 = Ward-Bailey |first1 = Jeff |title = Google chairman: We’re making 'real progress' on artificial intelligence |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2015/0914/Google-chairman-We-re-making-real-progress-on-artificial-intelligence |website = CSMonitor |accessdate = November 25, 2015 |date = November 25, 2015 }}</ref>

=== TensorFlow ===
TensorFlow is Google Brain's second-generation system. Version 1.0.0 was released on February 11, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/07bb8ea2379bd459832b23951fb20ec47f3fdbd4/RELEASE.md|title=Tensorflow Release 1.0.0|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>  While the [[reference implementation]] runs on single devices, TensorFlow can run on multiple [[central processing unit|CPUs]] and [[GPU]]s (with optional [[CUDA]] and [[SYCL]] extensions for [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]]).<ref name=Metz-Nov10>{{cite news |last1 = Metz |first1 = Cade |title = TensorFlow, Google's Open Source AI, Points to a Fast-Changing Hardware World |url = https://www.wired.com/2015/11/googles-open-source-ai-tensorflow-signals-fast-changing-hardware-world/ |accessdate = November 11, 2015 |website = Wired |date = November 10, 2015 }}</ref> TensorFlow is available on 64-bit [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[Windows]], and mobile computing platforms including [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].

Its flexible architecture allows for the easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, [[Tensor_processing_unit|TPU]]s), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices.

TensorFlow computations are expressed as [[State (computer science)|stateful]] [[dataflow programming|dataflow]] [[directed graph|graphs]]. The name TensorFlow derives from the operations that such neural networks perform on multidimensional data arrays. These arrays are referred to as "[[tensor]]s". In June 2016, Dean{{By whom|date=December 2018}} stated that 1,500 repositories on [[GitHub]] mentioned TensorFlow, of which only 5 were from Google.<ref name="1500repo's">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnm83GqgqPE  Machine Learning: Google I/O 2016 Minute 07:30/44:44 ] accessdate=2016-06-05</ref>

=== Tensor processing unit (TPU) ===
In May 2016, Google announced its [[Tensor processing unit|Tensor processing unit (TPU)]], an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (a hardware chip) built specifically for [[machine learning]] and tailored for TensorFlow. TPU is a programmable [[AI accelerator (computer hardware)|AI accelerator]] designed to provide high [[throughput]] of low-precision arithmetic (e.g., [[8-bit]]), and oriented toward using or running models rather than [[Supervised learning|training]] them. Google announced they had been running TPUs inside their data centers for more than a year, and had found them to deliver an [[order of magnitude]] better-optimized [[performance per watt]] for machine learning.<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Jouppi |first1 = Norm |title = Google supercharges machine learning tasks with TPU custom chip |url = https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html |website = Google Cloud Platform Blog |accessdate = May 19, 2016 }}</ref>

In May 2017, Google announced the second-generation, as well as the availability of the [[Tensor processing unit|TPU]]<nowiki/>s in [[Google Compute Engine]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/google-cloud-offer-tpus-machine-learning/|title=Build and train machine learning models on our new Google Cloud TPUs|date=May 17, 2017|work=Google|access-date=May 18, 2017|language=en}}</ref> The second-generation TPUs deliver up to 180 teraflops of performance, and when organized into clusters of 64 TPUs, provide up to 11.5 petaflops.

In February 2018, Google announced that they were making [[Tensor processing unit|TPUs]] available in beta on the [[Google Cloud Platform]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/02/Cloud-TPU-machine-learning-accelerators-now-available-in-beta.html|title=Cloud TPU machine learning accelerators now available in beta|work=Google Cloud Platform Blog|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en}}</ref>

===TensorFlow Lite===
In May 2017, Google announced a software stack specifically for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] development, TensorFlow Lite,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15645908/google-ai-tensorflowlite-machine-learning-announcement-io-2017|title=Google’s new machine learning framework is going to put more AI on your phone|publisher=}}</ref> beginning with [[Android Oreo]].

=== Applications ===
[[Google]] officially released [[RankBrain]] on October 26, 2015, backed by TensorFlow.

Google also released {{not a typo|Co|laboratory}}, which is a TensorFlow Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html|title=Colaboratory – Google|website=research.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}</ref>

=== Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC) ===
On March 1, 2018, Google released its Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC). Originally designed to help equip Google employees with practical artificial intelligence and machine learning fundamentals, Google rolled out its free TensorFlow workshops in several cities around the world before finally releasing the course to the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/|title=Machine Learning Crash Course with TensorFlow APIs|publisher=Google|language=en}}</ref>
